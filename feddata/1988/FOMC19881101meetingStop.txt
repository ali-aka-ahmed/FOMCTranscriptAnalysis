 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, Ed Boehne expressed
 views very, well. would put perhaps little
 differently. seems actions Humphrey-Hawkins

 rotation shouldn't affect ability Committee carry

 like Ed, don't think big issue.
 Committee, certainly wouldn't object. say one

 end ordinarily March 1st. understand it, adopt
 change, term would end earlier, it's significant
 far I'm concerned. legal issue, counsel also looked
 agreed views expressed Mr. Bradfield.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. support change two reasons. One,
 came time targets already established,
 didn't major disagreements targets feel
 [didn't have] much infuence them. Now, that's small point.
 larger point one alluded. There's sense
 accountability gets attached targets it.

 think people feel responsible, public
 much better record [by which] measure people performance.
 So, there's accountability proposed change would
 support.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. want make different point, don't

 underline point single largest industry

 abstract effects drought, forecast
 growth average 2 percent next year slowing
 growth centered areas mentioned Greenbook

 consumer spending durables. although inflation certainly could
 less next year, think underlying rate inflation probably
 improve. seems me, therefore,
 tightening action may required sometime 1989.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Well, outlook broadly, national
 context, consistent Board's forecast; certainly
 numerical sense would true, perhaps little bit

 high levels.
 think really major question whether
 moderation continue flow prices.

 true, we're getting market

 auto side far continue big auto years.
 could also get market saturation sector.
 Finally, comment agricultural sector:
 hate
 mention it, I'm going say one thing aflatoxin,
 issue badly think blown proportion;
 it's really big issue might expect reading
 press. FDA's standards aflatoxin really very,
 tight. It's one issues eat ton corn
 flakes forever get trouble. standards
 reduced bit, first hit exchanges corn prices took
 big dive; beans, sympathy, also went down. They've come back
 think markets looking kind nonissue. [statistically] measurable perspective, would expect
 aflatoxin effect would stopped, admittedly [the
 price corn] drought would effect
 of, say, 5 10 percent. Given year's drought, early
 anticipation next year's planting heavy.
 course we're million miles away event.
 expectation acreage 35 million acres,
 12 14 percent. get reasonable growing season
 [weather], production could pretty heavy. Meanwhile, land values
 continuing increase--3 percent recent quarter
 4 percent year. So, must say net least District,
 agricultural sector come much better one might
 expected given kind circumstances dealing
 with.
 think national perspective well
 District's, things pretty good balance. would agree
 doubt moderation experiencing

 textile output would expect. Retail sales fairly sluggish

 Sixth District, agriculture spite drought picked
 prospects farm income improved considerably
 we've late rain brought yields several

 helping farmers.
 Two things would mention:
 going around
 District talking business people, bankers, directors,
 see little evidence price increases. price
 increases coming raw materials, apparently many industries
 able--at point least District--to pass
 through. keep asking wage pressures and, spite
 labor shortages, don't see much way evidence
 increased wages either services sector organized
 industries.
 national economy, forecast bit stronger
 one shown Greenbook. think partly
 assumed restraint put place 1989,
 Greenbook obviously has. result that, also see higher
 inflation, would tend agree Frank Morris
 [Greenbook] inflation forecast probably best one could
 come with. real economy side, think consumer
 expenditures going somewhat stronger. also think
 improvement net exports going somewhat smaller
 Board staff forecasting. Now, think Mike Prell put
 finger something apparent past

 part many people 5 percent inflation acceptable

 that, concern LBO activity

 Reflecting comments others made,
 agricultural picture lot rosier might anticipated
 one time. Corn crops came better expected; soybeans
 higher last year; cotton crop 25-year record; rice
 crop good; tobacco crop best 4 years, I'd say
 generally picture pretty rosy District.
 Finally, terms credit demand bank lending relatively

 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. respect
 national economy would agree Greenbook growth 1988.
 1989 project bit slower growth Greenbook, that's
 without assumption interest rates would rise 1989.

 guess could conclude, therefore, [projecting]
 modestly slower growth Greenbook. Nonetheless,
 it's close real relevance purpose.
 regard District economy, agricultural

 regard manufacturing sector,
 it's roughly flat. Retail sales flat.
 It's interesting
 also found little evidence price increases showing
 District. However, without exception talk business
 people District, inflation still minds. There's
 interesting activity going energy sector drop
 [price of] oil.

 It's fairly sizable part economy

 areas depressed earlier agriculture energy

 It's going take long time work way out.
 Overall, think

 without additional tightening. checking great deal

 inventories expressed inventories-to-sales ratios
 constant dollar terms--I'm thinking chart get
 Goldman-Sachs time--it shows inventories quite
 good shape think we're assuming are.
 Also, sales
 part ratio weakens much, look like acceptable ratios
 quickly become touch high. Also, regard business
 spending .on equipment, I'm hearing decision makers
 comment uncertainties future tax policy
 hear talk fixing deficit think
 going put damper kind activity.
 Also, questions [they have] sales prospects
 businesses think tend support sluggishness.

 housing side, agree sales existing homes strong,
 also know many realtors beating bushes
 telling customers buy home prices going

 there's good results last three

 Also, I'd like take minute report

 And, therefore, thought might
