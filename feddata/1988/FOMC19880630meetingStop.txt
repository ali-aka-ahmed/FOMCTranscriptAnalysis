 Absolutely; yes.

 volatile. lot volatility, way, largest
 banks, may associated things like tax dates.
 MS. SEGER. Picking one Manley's questions--if
 hadn't done recent +$50 million borrowing target,
 would think fed funds rate might today? Would still
 hitting 8 percent?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 think extent
 largely function quarter-end pressures, would think
 would close anyway--shade eighth maybe-MS. SEGER. thought took move
 worried next days fed funds rate would decline
 7-1/2 percent didn't it.
 guess that's confuses
 me.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 think concern
 
 longer-MS. SEGER.
 
 expect special factors or--
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. think longer-term matter judgment
 staying $500 million could tend push
 funds rate back down. question whether really
 appropriate light kind directive come

 pressures month went on.
 MS. SEGER. seasonal influences greater
 originally expected be?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 seemed me, yes.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. KOHN. think funds rate could come
 downward pressure end last week. remember phone
 calls Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday funds

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, terms kind
 anecdotal impressionistic points view reach us, would
 say essentially unchanged main thrust
 hear still decidedly upbeat [unintelligible] terms
 orders, especially manufacturing sector. took informal
 survey past 2 weeks 8 10 major companies
 particular point capital goods imports substitution
 results
 domestic sources capital goods imports.
 survey decisive, certainly suggestive
 fact evidence even capital goods
 sector substitution going terms domestic versus
 clearly
 foreign sources, although that's mainly components.
 important instahces of, say, heavy machinery, foreign
 sources practical purposes source. Nevertheless,
 margin, signs better [unintelligible],
 especially components, capital goods sector. two
 things bit different impressionistically--and bit
 surprising--are commentary coming upstate New
 York, even Buffalo area, upbeat been,
 there's bit commentary labor market
 tightness scattered signs pressures wages.
 insofar forecasts concerned,
 think one thing pretty clear--they approached
 go back 6 months ago, example, look
 humility.
 happened, compared talked about,
 humility well earned sense performance
 first half year--regardless exactly second
 quarter comes out--clearly going great deal stronger
 still remember
 widely expected turn year.
 comment time, Mr. Chairman, said [of
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 -15-
 
 forecast] might interesting thought something
 going wrong it. wrong it, course,
 economy stronger rather weaker. So, think
 take forecast kind broad-brush profile might
 emerge rather great deal precision.
 Again, question is: risks
 consequences risks forecasts? look
 light, think risks decidedly asymmetric side
 upward drift, worse, inflation rate next 6
 quarters, given current policy. Without making big deal
 this, look, example, New York staff's forecast,
 unlike Board staff's forecast, essentially assumes current
 interest rates period whole. staff forecast shows
 real growth rate next 6 quarters range 2-1/2 2-3/4
 percent. But--and big "but"--that result emerges
 context New York staff's forecast smaller gain
 net exports inventories declining every quarter
 forecast period.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 inventory investment?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes. Hence, implied growth
 final domestic demand forecast is, fact, good deal
 stronger Board staff's forecast. surprisingly
 setting, inflation numbers fall forecast
 significantly different end fixed-weight deflator
 5 percent plus range CPI 5-1/2 5-3/4 percent
 range. Again, take numbers grain salt,
 take grain salt inflation rate,
 however measured, get area 5 percent more,
 getting back 4 percent--much less price stability, whatever
 means--is going involve enormous costs economy. So, think
 greatest risk lies.
 ask question: Well, risks translate
 terms now? And, particularly, weight
 given changes already made policy insofar
 broad sweep outlook concerned?
 certainly agree
 thrust staff's Greenbook Bluebook commentary
 effect domestic demand growth going
 curbed period. sure much weight give
 rise interest rates we've seen last couple
 months, fact, rise rather modest, think. Indeed,
 look real interest rates Ted's chart 8 book
 yesterday--or formulation real short-term long-term
 interest rates--I think make case whole lot
 changed. Certainly, level real interest rates
 wildly different last 3 years.
 question mind much difference current policy
 posture makes versus were, say, 8 10 weeks ago.
 bottom line see it, if--for policy reasons,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bob, hear correctly?
 Twelfth District slowing?
 MR. PARRY.
 
 said
 
 rate growth slowing somewhat.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 slowing?
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, I'd say it's fairly general.
 We've seen
 slowing retail spending. We've checked retailers
 seems less spending across board retail area,
 although concentrated I'd say apparel and, extent,
 automobiles. Even lumber, think, growing rapidly
 they've hit constraint.
 look
 [developments], it's basically consistent slowing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 It's characterized supply

 Yes, taking retailer, it's clearly

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, regard District

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd like interrupt minute,
 crucial issue seems emerging here,
 wondering whether could retrace second. Everyone
 commenting explicitly wage data don't show this,
 there's subliminal sense changing wage demand pressures. Could

 What's evidence you're-MR. KEEHN.
 
 That's problem; evidence.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. you're obviously speaking people

 It's guess; something

 First, think take wage related data whole,

 It's lot less

 comments.
 One think could make case

 MR. FORRESTAL. Yes. it's hard put finger

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, Eleventh District,
 great deal changed.
 think reported

 half last year.
 seems flattened last
 several months--at least that's statistics saying.
 It's
 little confusing, though, talking business people
 around District I'm probably hearing optimism,
 banking real estate, I've heard last couple years.
 think expectations pretty [unintelligible] Houston area,

 Looking District trying project ahead, think

 bit. Energy stable. We've seen considerable job loss
 retail trade financial services; and, course, construction
 remains weakest sector.
 We're little negative impact drought,
 it's anything compared what's happening parts
 country. dry spots, although judging reports
 earlier week dry spots District pretty
 good rains; pretty good rains missing
 them, it's kind evening out.
 drought, though, pretty

 much way. Job security hopefully trying get little
 job growth we're hearing about, opposed
 conversation pressures moving wages. national
 picture, we're pretty close Board staff that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. don't think local District numbers provide
 lot insight; they're much line what's going
 nationally--somewhat stronger manufacturing growth, somewhat weaker
 residential nonresidential construction. But, particularly
 nonresidential sector, late adjust; quite strong
 national figures turning down.
 wage side, thing add pretty much
 mirrors Bob Forrestal said. got
 major consumer durables manufacturing firm, really
 people see CPI numbers begin approach 5 percent.

 he's seeing yet. judgment, would reason
 this, wage side.
 Nationally, forecast based St. Louis model.
 we've done pick monetary growth--I don't know whether
 call appropriate monetary policy likely monetary policy--that's
 consistent we've seen '87 first half '88,
 M1 growth somewhere 4 6 percent area.
 throws terms numbers something that's close
 Board staff's forecast second half year. next

 said that, guess also say
 comparing period, say, late '70s early '80s, we're
 dealing monetary growth rates roughly half
 dealing time. So, I'm sure longer-term
 context much accomplish longer-run
 inflationary goals. guess I'm saying, part, think what's

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, let talk little District
 first.
 commented drought last night really don't
 much add situation. Exclusive drought, although
 it's hard rigorous sense, think District
 economic growth actually accelerating. continued
 
 improvement mining economy, continued strength pulp paper,
 wood products, forth. turning good
 good year tourism, even though hot catch
 fish. Minnesota, terms economic activity
 heart District, weren't drought, think you'd
 almost describe situation boom. Unemployment
 Minnesota touch 3 percent.
 metropolitan areas, economy reasonably diversified,
 
 looking strong economies.
 situation.
 
 So, that's description
 
 far wage pressures go, we've picked anecdotally
 directors advisory council people this: one
 manufacturers, whose entry level wage $6 $7 hour,
 reported can't keep people wage all. It's
 like running employment agency. They'll hire somebody
 morning; [the new employees] work couple hours don't
 like it, walk door first break apparently
 go across street go something else. It's tight labor
 market sense. reports, certainly, minimum
 wage jobs going vacant District. experience
 it's certainly taking longer, considerably longer, fill
 entry level clerical jobs recently year ago.
 Another one manufacturers
 indicated he's starting problems union.
 Now, don't think translated higher wages anything
 like yet, impression union starting
 get aggressive. least that's reported.
 far national economic situation concerned,
 find largely agreement Greenbook outlook.
 Greenbook, least view, point right issues
 confront here. think might well difficult without
 policy actions keep rate increase
 deflator 4 percent sustained period time.
 Whether we'd quarter-to-quarter PERIOD, wouldn't try
 forecast. hunch that's risks lie.
 think international considerations going turn
 important, perhaps increasingly important, situation
 struck fact it's economy grown
 rapidly last several quarters, number important
 foreign economies. things equal, think add
 demand pressures.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 District question raised
 MR. BOEHNE.
 wages, concern higher wage costs certainly
 think
 I've tried pin best can.
 anecdotal sense.
 large extent it's state mind, ask specifics,
 kinds things I'm told: appears
 greatest pressure starting salaries lower levels.

 example, someone runs large supermarket chain
 District told raise starting salaries 25
 percent--now turns $1 $1.25 hour.
 then, work people 6 months year
 year half experience, get kind stair-step
 increase. Another place hear services
 example, financial institutions, whereas year
 institutions.
 ago talking wage budgets increases 5
 6 percent range, hear right 6 percent, I'm
 hearing talk 6-1/2 percent. Another thing hear 5
 percent number CPI seems one special concern.
 aren't many COLA clauses union contracts
 several years ago, contracts, 5 percent CPI
 Since we've getting pretty close
 seems trigger point.
 recent months, think there's concern COLA may
 triggered. Now, impact. Generally,
 think
 concern [wages coming the] non-union side.
 surprising District because, there's one unifying
 theme among almost everybody talk throughout District, it's
 very, tight labor markets. Otherwise District,
 reports strong manufacturing moderation retail
 sales--the kind things find Districts.
 national level, Jerry Corrigan said lot
 [On inflation side
 wanted say terms [unintelligible].
 we] see accelerating trend. example, consumer price
 index last 3 months 4.9 percent versus 3.9 percent
 previous year. producer price index last 3 months 6.2
 percent, previous year, 2.2 percent.
 look
 intermediate [level], crude goods producer price index rose
 rate 8-1/2 percent last 3 months 5 percent
 previous 12 months. industrial raw materials really
 highest level expansion since '79-'80 peak. So,
 think it's we're fearful economy running
 think
 supply constraints inflation future.
 seeing tangible signs we're accelerating
 trend. it's much less costly try keep inflation
 accelerating unwind later on.
 chart show yesterday, heard it, essentially
 basic message slow real growth
 something like 3 percent plus 2 percent little more.
 agree general. idea done 1
 percent rise interest rates next year--I hope that's
 right. suspect would [not] large kick
 small increase interest rates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, think data
 last two months pretty close ideal. We've slowdown

 welcomed.
 
 quite alarmed

 seen since December
 
 We're seeing first signs impact slowdown
 military spending. General Electric laid 800 people
 defense electric factory. It's first layoff defense
 industry I've seen. think military budget stimulus
 economy peaked probably somewhat negative
 influence next years. perhaps give us
 little breathing room industrial sector--breathing room
 need much. think we're point economy really
 can't sustain growth rate 2 percent without generating
 inflationary pressures. think we've got lean
 period growth excess that. sense
 deceleration recent months hope continues.
 I've going around New England private campaign
 avoid future commercial building glut District.
 kind euphoria commercial building Texas
 earlier years. think there's proper recognition
 New England economy point really going
 slowly growing economy. That's speech Mr. [unintelligible]
 referred yesterday. We're 2.9 percent unemployment rate.
 addition that, we've got slower natural growth rate labor
 force rest country birth rate
 relatively low. That's compounded fact labor force
 participation rate substantially higher national rate.
 We're running 2 percentage points higher participation
 rate men 3-1/2 percentage points higher women. So,
 way grow fast national economy
 large in-migration population.
 arithmetic New England economy clear.
 We're going slow-growing--prosperous, slow-growing-economy next decade. see commercial developers
 making plans assumption we're going grow fast
 past 15 years. That's I'm trying generate
 little caution among lenders, think history
 Dallas every place long lenders
 provide developers money, they're going build. remember
 well time couple years ago Bob Boykin expressed
 dismay fact new office building getting started
 Dallas despite drop price oil despite fact
 vacancy rate 20 percent. we're trying
 building boom doesn't end glut. I'm
 sure we'll successful, we're trying.
 regional area, expectation rising rate
 wage increases can't provide documentation either.
 Steve McNees generated wage forecasting model number years ago
 performed well last years model
 says wages going much faster
 been.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's true every model.
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 -25-
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 Yes. think really basis
 concern, really can't look data say we're
 think may basis concern
 inflection point.
 generally. Wages growing rapidly 6th year
 expansion have, ergo, growing lot
 faster.
 think quite clearly job keep sharp eye
 growth rate economy lean gets [too
 high].
 don't know whether 2 percent guideline proper
 one; I'm inclined think that, given arithmetic productivity
 labor force growth, can't come number lot higher
 that.
 really question, unless get much better
 productivity performance we've had, whether 2-1/2 percent
 staff using high--whether two percent may
 realistic. think we're point we've got lean
 rate growth excess 2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, let say see things

 similar many presidents.
 First, growth issue,
 clearly pace growth we've shown strong
 sustainable without acceleration inflation. kind
 growth necessary keep inflation accelerating--or even
 allow decelerate current levels--I idea.
 would
 hate get trying fix number shoot set
 monetary policy.
 think ought take action
 see response we're looking terms financial market
 expectations environment decelerating inflation,
 regardless growth rate consequences happen be.
 But, like everyone else, think economy certainly
 looked strong, manufacturing high level exports near
 boom. acknowledge exactly Frank saying: year
 far we've seen leveling beginning slowing
 manufacturing; orders started trend down. Payroll
 employment growth rates slowed. still significant growth
 employment, slowed. housing market certainly
 lower levels. Domestic demand continuing grow slow pace
 So, think we're getting kind domestic demand growth
 '87.
 performance we've seeking policy, that's
 encouraging.
 markets starting acknowledge
 effectiveness policy, opinion. finally, think,
 seen financial markets start react firmness
 policies. opinion, we've seen fundamental shift
 exchange rate, acknowledged bond markets
 degree. could turn around get whole set
 series bad trade numbers things don't look like they're
 continuing progress external side. Nevertheless,
 think we've gotten kind response financial markets
 we've seeking policy.
 One things concerns little makes want
 cautious stage fact we're getting
 response, dollar strengthened, yield curve
 flattened out--all think desirable characteristics
 exactly want see policy--this response
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 nevertheless going put pressure foreign central banks tighten
 monetary policies. Bundesbank raised discount
 rate morning. think that's probably desirable given fact,
 Gary pointed out, economies growing
 faster pace. Nevertheless, it's going effect damping
 domestic demand abroad. So, think stronger dollar United
 States response foreign central banks tighten, shield
 potential transmission inflationary pressures
 there, going damp foreign domestic demand.
 combination slow domestic demand damped
 foreign domestic demand, think, want; it's
 works.
 There's going lag there, think
 careful go point we're going combine
 fairly slow domestic demand growth decelerating foreign
 domestic demand leave without trade adjustment.
 think risk that, although always get trade
 adjustment dramatically weaker U.S. domestic demand imports.
 think that's we're looking for.
 So, think lagged
 effect policy action works we're seeing
 inflation side extent--as already
 mentioned--the lagged effect past policy actions. we've

 done recent past going show lag.
 financial markets, think, showing confidence fact
 effective policies; otherwise, can't imagine
 long bond markets dollar would behaving well
 have.
 It's true commodity prices accelerating
 sharply.
 attribute lot drought conditions
 less forward looking others; commodity futures, think,
 go couple years. turn dime. We've
 two sharp declines--to limit--on CRB index last couple
 days little rain Midwest.
 think
 fairly careful point lags
 take account.
 wage side, again, don't see acceleration
 wages [published] numbers. slight curves
 numbers, don't look wavier since
 1983.
 sense nervousness. We're 6 years
 road expansion there's doubt industry
 nervous progress wage front point on.
 Conference Chairmen met recently, without exception,
 said saw pressure wages, like
 said. Yet sense that, workers felt going
 fall behind relative price pressures real wages
 deteriorate another year, might see much militant
 labor situation.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.

 think pointed conference meeting
 expecting wage pressures '87.
 thought going
 arise upward pressure oil prices, caused
 CPI grow faster nominal wages year.
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 -27-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 He's head
 
 MR. JOHNSON. said surprised pressure
 didn't materialize. think that's going wrong
 models, reason.
 don't know long get
 that, fact is, wage pressures yet there.
 think another year accelerating prices relative nominal wages
 might problem.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think wage models don't
 ratio imports domestic demand, you're going
 way. that's clearly what's that.
 MR. KELLEY. Manley, excuse interrupting you,
 went that. said inflation
 pressures generated wage pressures. made flat statement.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Yes,
 
 think that's right.
 
 MR. BLACK.
 
 Well, one thing bear mind

 taking big share business there. Yesterday, talked
 closed conversation saying "I'm getting extremely
 worried inflation."
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 is.
 That's fast turnaround two weeks.
 
 MR. BLACK. doesn't expect associates'
 [wages go up], he's worried inflationary pressures
 emanating elsewhere increases salaries wages
 people. That's one problems.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Right, is.
 
 MR. BLACK.
 MR. JOHNSON. No, responsible; respect
 judgment. So, wage front, say there's nothing
 yet, get feeling something there.
 time, think strong good feelings going

 go here, think, going lagged response
 we've last 6 months so.
 we've got

 think probably risks still
 upside downside well. think need
 careful point pay attention lags
 taking place forward-looking markets
 effective opinion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Turning District, Mr. Chairman, think
 it's safe say, summary, grassroots contacts don't
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 -28-
 
 really see slowing expansion, contrast
 national figures seem showing. widespread reports
 extremely high levels capacity operation textiles, furniture,
 chemicals, paper--that sort thing; difficulty hiring workers;
 upward pressure wages--and concrete example case
 fast food industries push wages
 well minimum number places; also reports
 shortages chemicals certain areas. example,
 suppliers certain [raw materials] uses
 put quotas can't produce enough satisfy demand.
 case housing, Washington familiar
 happened around here. can't keep demand.
 pretty much sort thing happened Richmond,
 Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, Durham areas,
 economy really booming. Home prices Washington last
 couple years gone 1/3 pretty much sort
 thing true Richmond. That's seem feel,
 think Frank right saying statistics show slowing
 there.
 Insofar particular projections concerned, there's
 lot difference we've projected Board
 staff done, except expect inflation next year
 Interestingly enough, Tom Melzer
 put [their forecast].
 ended exactly amount additional inflation
 next year. important thing, think, staff's
 analysis assumption need tightening
 actions order bring results they're projecting.
 analysis conducted Bank reaches sort
 conclusion. guess there's going error, would
 come Jerry Corrigan rest did:
 Board staff's forecast--and well--might actually
 forecasting less inflation we're apt really have.
 rate we're going, Greenbook shows smooth
 transition expansion driven domestic demand toward one
 driven foreign demand. Except brief upswing third
 quarter, rate growth gross private domestic purchases
 expected slow significantly result weakening
 consumer demand business fixed investment. And, course, that's
 perfectly plausible scenario, would excellent one
 works out. But, I'm sure everyone would agree, it's
 far safe bet. guess would conclude business fixed
 investment particular, given high levels capacity
 utilization, apt somewhat stronger we're thinking. So,
 short, think Greenbook forecast reasonable
 defensible, that's probably best could hope for;
 fears we're going well inflation
 side.

 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Let start labor issue. don't

 However, don't think go forever we're liable see

 haven't asked specifically, fact haven't brought

 overly concerned particular point time.
 Overall, District continues strong capital

 lot things working correctly
 District.
 aren't working well. Districts,
 retail sales seem little softer construction softer. guess
 I'm little uncomfortable analyzing, going seems
 kind Phillip's curve framework here, talk
 resource constraints versus inflation. think Governor Johnson put
 back track. concerns, least mine, focus around
 fact couple years 4 percent inflation.

 don't seem making much progress toward [reducing] it.
 think that's real focus, least view, monetary policy.
 look ahead, even Board staff's forecast, substantial
 tightening it, produces another 4 percent next year
 minimum. Board staff's forecast CPI ex energy ex food 5
 percent. leaves position says think
 concerned inflation. don't know much
 may move again; I'm sure much really moved
 past 6 months.
 know interest rates are, don't know
 much market put versus policy moves. So,
 think boils expectations important us
 right now. signal markets, think, important.
 I'm sure magnitudes ought signaling,
 certainly would err side moving earlier rather later.
 So, see strengths across board boom; continue
 worry errors international side somewhat
 higher terms real growth think point time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. seems last 6 months we've
 rather noticeable shift, least part staff.

 that's somewhat consistent that. look Greenbook
 numbers, don't focus number focus on, real GNP
 targeting. I'm somewhat like Lee Hoskins Manley Johnson

 regard. one number Greenbook
 believe desirable forecast, that's nominal GNP.
 point nominal GNP numbers forecast show
 kind decline seems consistent ultimate
 goals. seems it's somewhat dangerous us policy
 context focusing real GNP focus nominal GNP.
 look numbers there, see 1984 we've
 one year nominal GNP 7 percent range,
 1987. right, staff forecast 6.7
 1988 6.0 1989.
 seems
 forecast bringing nominal GNP back 4.5 percent
 1986, right medicine monetary policy brings
 nominal GNP down. don't see get trouble
 bring nominal consistently down. I'm somewhat satisfied
 kind policy background.
 I'm going hand charts regard commodity
 prices. somewhat reluctantly believe
 commodity prices good signal exchange rates are.
 believe it's politic talk commodity prices
 talk exchange rates. think ways we're
 talking thing. But, since staff get
 experimental index chart show, thought least ought
 little background regard experimental index.
 Now, first all, experimental index designed show
 flow-through capabilities commodity prices producer price
 index consumer price index. index
 consumption-weighted index. Now, chart chart
 index without oil. consumption-weighted index oil very,
 high; whether we're IMF anyone
 else it, end getting high weights oil.
 staff work shown--and
 excellent work part Board's staff regard--is
 year-over-year rates change commodity prices
 successful leading changes rate change CPI
 year-over-year basis, commodity indices tend
 7- 9-month lead time, seems superior
 leading index real economy. So, first page
 I've shown commodity index without oil it.
 see, index shown downward movement
 showing upward jag. upward jag drought effect. Now,
 don't know index would looked like without drought.
 suspect might looked like. second page
 shows full index--I mean index designed.
 year-over-year rate change clearly shows turning point
 index would consistent CPI year-over-year rate
 change peaking September 1987. proves
 case, constitutes clear false signal. don't know;
 may well constituted false signal full
 index saying one thing index without oil saying something
 else. So, think it's uncertain case.
 Ed Boehne gave us data CPI PPI;
 again, tend look year-over-year rates change. CPI
 year-over-year peaked 4.6 4.7 last fall; 4.4
 December; crept 3.9 stalled. I'm somewhat
 suspicious index may move back 4 again.
 
 6/29-30/88

 drought effects food prices, think that's quite likely. Now,
 last page shows commodity index, full index 1982
 consumption weights.
 one happens strange base
 January 1986 it.
 would understand
 might mean us, index gives indication
 monetary policy successful holding deflationary environment
 occurring 1986.
 seems give evidence
 that, although recent trend 1988 suspicious;
 you're chartist draw lines 1988, say

 exchange rates, seems me, showing something
 else regards scarcity money. dwell
 item, would point even staff, apparently
 believe exchange rate December '88--if read report
 correctly--will December '87--.

 correct, Ted?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No, think it's little, 4 percent.
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 Well, thought 7 percent rise
 December you're projecting 7-1/2 percent fall June

 think you're probably right far December
 concerned.
 may remember October, November, December

 One thing would mention regard defense

 final comment I'd make regard money markets.
 seems last five months money markets
 bond markets responded well policy moves we've made.
 may think policy moves, seem
 we've attempting lower growth path monetary

 bond markets behaved well seen us

 seems Chairman indicated [unintelligible]

 guess I'd expect continue. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. respect
 economic activity, particularly relation Tenth District,

 however, isn't clear that's going continue.
 drought worsen--and that's iffy situation sense

 drought District would turn pessimism back optimism;
 think agriculture would continue recovery track.
 Energy, hand, flat OPEC's
 indecision softening oil prices. Drilling rigs
 decreased total numbers last month two, although
 they're still 8 percent year-ago levels. Mining
 recovery stage, certainly brisk. Manufacturing
 dominated largely auto aircraft industry Tenth

 that's far
 haven't closed--are operating two shifts.
 flat-out production. Aircraft, hand,

 result, industry looking up.
 respect question wage inflation price
 inflation generally, simply good evidence
 emerged would suggest that's present now, although would
 agree suggest feeling right

 present real evidence it's accelerating. seems

 But, year half search, seems

 Now, let point national picture.
 think
 forecast really follow Greenbook forecast. I'm
 bit optimistic Greenbook forecast, think
 features already feeling pessimistic.
 Greenbook growth rate dipping year now--that's

 minus column; capacity utilization dropping.
 happening, plus low monetary growth we've seen last
 year--and pointed yesterday, we're still bottom end
 last year's target cone--I don't see big surge inflation
 people expect. Governor Johnson already pointed
 clearly think happening: past monetary policy
 really helped break inflationary impetus seen
 building up. Governor Angell, think, said thing.
 yield curve flattening, long rates coming down, dollar
 going up, see two sort opposing trends commodity
 markets. one hand, effect drought;
 hand [unintelligible] prices dropping sharply
 last couple weeks that's often fairly good inflation
 indicator, too. So, sum up, think already slowing
 trends. see results tightness policies
 instituted last year early part year. would
 expect inflationary expectations downward trend. Thank
 you.

 Greenbook forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Don?
 Let add
 something saying.
 one sense, we're looking
 monetary policy short run sort crucial thing
 discussed meeting. But, sense, relevant
 issue. go back 1960s, especially 1970s,
 recollection toward latter part 1970s still
 acceleration inflation expectations. remember Milton
 Friedman used draw lines top highs
 inflation always successively higher bottoms lows
 Despite that, late
 always successively higher.
 1970s--I suspect really middle 1979--inflation expectations
 really never took hold. Long-term nominal bond yields
 exceptionally low. sudden markets got message
 long-term rates went up, think, 450 basis points mid-1979
 early 1980.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 never got short rates.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, never did; think
 looking inflation expectations really found way
 directly long end market.
 MR. JOHNSON. guess I'm saying never rose
 funds rate short-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I'm sure that's relevant
 issue, [the definition of] inflation expectations
 context really be: inflation premium embodied
 It's certainly case
 long-term interest rate?
 structure yield curve relevant, type
 issue. reason raise issue everyone's expectation
 couldn't break inflation psychology. And, indeed,
 Board--or FOMC--went torture damned
 years immediately subsequent get inflation expectations
 long-term bonds; hasn't fully succeeded. long-term
 nominal yields still reflecting degree inflation
 good deal higher 1970s 1960s.
 suggests
 market, come dramatically respect inflation,
 going two loops--meaning, effect, inflation
 coming back little.
 starts going back early 1990s--leaving
 issue getting 5 percent--that probably bring
 long-term yields nominal sense. suggests
 important decision Committee make
 specific issue.
 think ought decide whether believe
 money supply working whether believe it's longer
 relevant consideration. unless willing abandon
 hopes monetary aggregates coming back key elements within
 financial system, look numbers can't quite buy
 
 -38-
 
 6/29-30/88
 

 lower inflation thing I'm sure would work.
 think would happen squeezed point,
 economy would go recession political pressures would
 overwhelm us.
 certainly, must say alternative III looks like
 something is, far I'm concerned, probably minimum type
 adjustment current M2 ranges. Well, already spoken,
 let say would opt change 1988 alternative
 III 1989 figures.
 think time go around
 Let's try. Governor Angell.
 coffee gets cold?
 MR. ANGELL. alternative II, don't like quibbling
 question
 half percentage point numbers.
 alternative III versus alternative I. come way: prefer
 alternative III, prefer make decision next
 February. like year ago, preferred make decision
 closer time believe it's important
 credibility. would certainly want language HumphreyHawkins report indicate anticipate that.
 really prefer announce one believe
 something neighborhood 20 percent chance

 that's case wouldn't want make move.

 So, think could stick basically substance

 There's one observation I'd

 don't think

 don't like

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 Well, alternative III doesn't achieve
 MR. HOSKINS.
 objective I'm looking time, ratchet
 rate inflation. leaves us midpoint would
 inflationary Greenbook forecast, still 4 percent.
 So, pick number, would certainly look something
 like 2 6 percent, focus around consistent

 Greenbook; 1 5 percent might even preferable.
 going use something like III, think ought make

 explicit public statement going shoot
 lower end target range. Otherwise, implication
 it's 5 percent. alternative would narrow range-leave bottom end 3 percent pull top end 6

 think we'll get benefits without pay

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. HOSKINS.

 No, wanted to--
 
 MR. HOSKINS. I'd come III could make either

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. I'm maintaining current 1988 ranges
 1989 ranges go II, essentially reasons
 Governor Johnson expressed. think proceed slowly

 point, like Governor Angell saying, backtrack early
 next year going higher range time next year.
 think important us meet targets show

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 don't feel strongly that; live III.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. favor maintaining existing ranges
 '88 keeping position time last year, think
 makes sense maintain ranges '89
 another crack early next year, makes lot

 would certainly go II III; meantime, don't think

 MR. STERN. Well, nothing add.
 I'd keep ranges

 I'd stay
 
 '88, alternative III
 
 '89.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 I've always uncomfortable setting
 range year middle preceding year.

 sympathetic idea keep present range point
 1989 tell Congress that, thinking February
 think today, we'd probably reduce it. think ability
 forecast velocity limited, try set range 1989
 June 1988--that something. We've always done way;
 but, time know set middle year
 one, difficult revise middle year two.

 develops certain inertia people get concerned would
 happen image, on.
 seems get
 pattern keeping existing range, telling Congress we'd
 comfortable setting subsequent year's range February,
 we'd better long run.

 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 think it's terribly hard say, Governor
 Johnson. Committee conference call June 22,
 looking funds rates come 7-3/8 7-1/2
 percent; thought putting place $550 million
 would tend validate accept that. final week
 month, we've gotten higher funds rates quarter-end
 pressures.
 period ended yesterday, ended
 borrowing $520 million: never get even modest bulge
 thought we'd get final day. guess funds rate
 averaged 7.57 7.58 percent 2 weeks--I don't know,
 don't statement.
 
 -60-
 
 6/29-30/88
 
 MR. KOHN.
 
 7.58 percent.
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. guess would quarter-end
 pressures fade, funds rate get back toward something like
 looked mid-June--if stayed $550 million we'd
 get back 7-1/2 percent shade under. feel comfortable
 saying $600 million it'd likely around 7-1/2 percent,
 couldn't argue strongly would 7-1/2 percent
 shade also.
 MR. ANGELL. But, Peter, question is:
 stay $550 million, reputable Fed watchers say we've
 loosened?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 No,
 
 Well, let rephrase question.
 
 want answer question.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 keep question.
 
 No, stay $550 million, any--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 

 
 I'll answer it;
 
 say "no."
 
 Okay, agree answer.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, I'm delighted. Let ask
 this:
 think probability go $600
 million more?
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 50/50.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think probability
 go $550 million directly is?
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 15 percent.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 strikes me, therefore,
 take literally, chances higher we'll go
 rather down.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 That's want tilt policy.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, point
 fact case, risks clear; one much clout
 per unit action moving advance.
 must admit I'm really
 trying listen argument I'm difficulty it,
 general thrust policy
 extraordinarily successful. think additional $50
 million essentially ratifying that. ask me,
 think world going come end $550 million, well,
 obviously not.
 Looking markets know don't
 know, I'm even certain catch $50 million catch
 it.
 catch $50 million, consider fact
 That, strongly
