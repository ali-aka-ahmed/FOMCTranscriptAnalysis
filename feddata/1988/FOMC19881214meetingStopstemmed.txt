 comment?
 
 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. question. bad
 relationship get, unreli, drop
 approach?
 mr. kohn.
 
 don't know.
 
 ms. seger. so, manlei johnson indic, seem
 rule relationship hasn't super terrif
 rather except last four year so.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 mr. kohn. that's question committe answer.

 sort compromis work view work pretti
 well end.
 ms. seger. robot push
 $600 million kept go got it, would
 guess feder fund rate might gone?
 mr. kohn.
 [unintellig].
 bluebook
 indic altern "c," $600 million, fund
 rate would get toward 9 percent.
 ms. seger.
 
 don't think you'd go that?
 
 mr. parri. that's end-of-year adjust well?
 mean, could even higher short term?
 mr. kohn. could higher short period time,
 that's right.
 think would settl down.
 ms. seger.
 
 thank you.

 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid hoskin.
 
 mr. hoskin. disturb shift seem larger

 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid boehn.
 
 mr. boehn. well, think need step back
 narrow issu procedur procedur ask broader
 question polici itself. think last sever year
 polici gener good. compar happen
 last sever year went back last 20 year so,
 think gener done done

 now, issu is, procedur help us achiev
 goal? achiev good polici spite procedur?
 sens procedur help guid us
 toward better polici. procedur perfect. think we've
 found that, whatev procedur we've us, alwai time
 overrid it. manlei johnson's point correct
 point overrid much mayb ought
 look around. whole, look broad pictur, think
 procedur serv us well made better polici.
 mr. johnson. actual, i'm suggest would

 think that's help deflect polit pressur
 forth, continu move closer sens fund rate

 did,
 person would feel strongli differ proviso
 right now. effect, borrow reserv regim
 target fund rate, proviso base
 
 fund rate realli never oper. so, go
 explicitli that, i'd like see, time
 past kind proviso base reserv base, whether
 would given us kind balanc think look
 direct.
 guess, final, might ask rhetor question,
 part confus:
 go describ what's
 happen intermeet period mind degre
 reserv restraint measur borrow target
 set? effect, sai realli increas degre
 reserv restraint time borrow target come
 down. think put confus perspect.
 describ degre reserv restraint term balanc
 fund rate, that's on thing. mind that's realli
 "degre reserv restraint" meant. don't leav
 that? i'm sure that's easili answer, think know
 it.
 mr. kohn. we, cours, ad suggest addit
 paragraph polici record describ novemb 22 meet,
 attempt reconcil two thing.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid forrest.
 
 mr. forrest. well, mr. chairman, seem

 time hasn't come realli examin procedur perhap
 confirm realli target rate.
 wouldn't think period

 perhap think serious go pure fund target,
 1/8 percentag point degre precis attempt

 12/13-14/88
 
 what's said polici pretti good
 last coupl year follow current procedur, think

 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. well, it's interest discuss

 mr. black. well, would appeal whole lot

 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid parri.
 
 mr. parri. want abandon current oper
 procedur shouldn't basi you're confus
 market think market pretti well got straight.
 analyt, modifi flexibl feder fund rate
 so, seem
 approach, market know that.
 discuss ought revolv around best procedur;
 is, whether someth rigid far fed fund target
 appropri--which wouldn't happi support--or
 whether reserv target. think confus
 issu.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor johnson.
 
 mr. johnson. might technic option,
 know,
 alwai thought possibl would be--.
 estim borrow function; go quit sophist
 analysi know econometr equat estim long-term
 relationship fund rate borrow, seem
 could basi establish sort expect fund

 seem could still set borrow
 target; howev, fund rate start vari outsid
 rang predict estim long-term relationship,
 didn't realli know why, ought sensit
 fund rate versu try hit borrow number. would
 allow us pursu borrow procedur sensit
 fund rate get outsid expect band.
 mean, that's
 monei put in--what bob black sai--but least
 there's scientif reason, rhyme, set
 expect rang. think actual that's we've
 do.
 mr. parri.
 mr. johnson.
 
 go sai, isn't did?
 think that's okai; i'm oppos it.
 
 mr. heller. want formal that--i mean
 target--in direct, wouldn't squeez fed fund
 rate claus 50 basi point someth like that?
 mr. johnson.
 
 well, don't know variant ar.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -12-
 
 mr. kohn. go sai, term standard
 deviat borrow equat, feder fund band much
 larger we've toler. it's like 3/8th
 percentag point.
 mr. johnson.
 
 plu minu?
 
 mr. kohn.
 [$100 million], plu minu term standard
 deviat.
 right, dave?
 mr. lindsei. ye, that's $500 [million].
 judgment,
 desk come closer that, doesn't [unintellig]
 equat.
 mr. johnson. well, someth like that; ought least
 look standard deviat see that's within
 toler.
 mr. black. on thing probabl agre we've
 pretti darn good job we've had; it's
 question whether continu procedur.
 mr. stern. well, agre who've observ
 signific distanc awai even pure feder fund
 rate target guess would prefer keep distanc
 target.
 see coupl reason that. on
 extent grass alwai greener phenomenon. everi time problem
 crop we'd like find better wai would too.

 hunch search go turn long arduou.
 equal import, know pretti much commit
 feder fund rate 1970s.
 wouldn't attribut
 problem polici 1970s feder fund rate target,
 wouldn't sai help either. base
 histor experi, i'd cautiou go back
 someth like that. now, mai find differ wai implement
 closer control fund rate that's want do.

 think despit problem current procedur,
 histori 1970s doesn't make sanguin tighter control
 feder fund rate.
 mr. parri. but, gari, isn't rigid fed
 fund target?
 someth flexibl,
 seem work least period.
 mr. stern. i'm complain current procedur,
 said, it's long wai awai pure target fund rate.
 mr. black. advoc
 much wider band.
 would total oppos go
 back befor.
 market-mr. stern. guess wonder set
 adjust band, dai-to-dai within it.
 mr. hoskin.
 isn't risk
 band implicitli get narrow head back
 toward 1970s?
 someth like bob black want
 do, mayb tom melzer would tie probabl base--
 
 -13-
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 mr. johnson. know realiti point, long
 move point enough--that's bob sai. could
 explicit fund rate target, move often enough
 whole issu realli whether you're
 deal problem--.
 
 will move fund rate. guess gari sai
 1970s bodi explicit fund rate target,
 alwai
 reason wasn't will move fund rate enough.
 behind. think question is, went back that, would
 
 will move fund rate often?
 whether would not.
 
 issu realli
 
 mr. boehn. well, there's littl
 willing peopl it. goe wayn's point,
 movement fund rate much announc
 effect. current procedur allow flexibl absent
 announc effect.
 mr. johnson. true, tend agre bob parri:
 market know exactli; scrutin fund rate hourli.
 

 
 mr boehn. that's true, except market total
 logic it, half point increas discount rate ought
 equal 50 basi point increas fund rate,
 isn't.
 mr. johnson. see certain announc
 effect similar announc effect chang
 discount rate. think that's discount rate chang
 view intent fed lock fund rate
 level put floor it. so, think that's
 effect--of consid fed decis make fund rate
 perman rate it's go flexibl down.
 chairman greenspan.
 mr. johnson.
 
 temporarili.
 
 temporarili.
 
 mr. hoskin. well, it's clear market
 know ar. think market pick rate
 think at, allow move rate;

 two month ago ed boehn put us context.

 simpli inabl committe committe move

 whole new bushel basket full problem. guess
 it's partli spirit [that find ourselv] todai.
 go back ed boehn's comment, actual think
 procedur work pretti darn well.
 think governor

 me, too. great advantag

 kind like think we've got flexibl

 think also procedur work well suspect it's
