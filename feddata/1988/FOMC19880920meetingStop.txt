 Greenbook staff continue believe additional pressure
 financial markets would required slow expansion, etc.
 guess goes Mike: think you've seen full
 impact tightening moves we've date?
 MR. PRELL. No, thought even
 absorbed those, open enough slack, speak,
 reduce pressures economy enough, relieve
 inflationary pressures. Therefore, need hold growth

 slight shortfall actual growth potential slight
 easing pressures resources. think that, given
 underlying tendencies economy, going need bit

 quarters 1989.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Yes, Mike, I'd like follow-up question
 Governor Seger's questions. Apparently, optimum growth
 rate mind, let's say, next four quarters. would
 optimum growth rate be?
 MR. PRELL. don't know optimum growth rate.
 Basically, sense pressures resources great
 point hold inflation rate recent levels.
 feel easing [of pressures] necessary. believe
 trend real output growth somewhere around 2-1/2 percent.
 Therefore, believe we've got grow something
 order ease pressures. recognize uncertainties
 natural rate unemployment is, that's operative
 concept. recognize composition activity make
 difference of--. rough judgment, ultimately; don't want
 get precise it, basically think need
 additional restraint get economy potential,
 believe probably necessary.
 MR. ANGELL. But, Mike, precision helpful
 communication. take time pry number
 asking series questions, would save time you'd
 simply tell us.
 MR. PRELL. think cited number 2-1/2 percent,
 Governor Angell, believed potential GNP growth is.
 Therefore, depends fast want get inflation rate
 down.
 
 If--
 
 MR. ANGELL. would think would optimum
 adjustment process? mean, like 1-1/2 percent better
 2-1/2 percent?
 
 9/20/88
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, you're asking make policy judgment,
 subjective judgment short-run costs benefits

 greater chances see acceleration
 underlying inflation rate next year able tip

 think take

 MR. ANGELL. But, Mike, there's policy assumption involved
 interest rate forecast sure whether you'd
 prefer 1-1/2 percent real GNP growth 1/2 percent GNP growth
 negative 1/2 percent.
 I'd like better understanding
 think would take order get best adjustment.
 MR. PRELL. Again, don't feel I'm position declare

 suspect, going around table here,
 policymakers would different views risks
 would want take rapidly would want move bring

 trajectory you've outlined--declines 1 percent year

 don't think
 we're track now, think you'd need substantially greater

 order 1990 inflation trend 3 percent

 MR. ANGELL.
 question.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 last statement finally answered
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Mike, say federal funds rate
 forecast was?
 Lee asked, forgot.
 say 9-1/2 percent?
 MR. PRELL. We're looking around 9-1/2 percent.
 don't want precise.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Again,
 
 Yes, know.
 
 significant increase are.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. you're saying proportional move
 long-run rate 10 percent?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 about.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. question
 haven't seen kind trend moves funds rate
 year. We've 1-1/2 percentage point increase funds rate
 actually sharp flattening yield curve. Long rates stayed
 were, maybe going some, much less
 proportionally.
 think yield curve flattened
 
 9/20/88
 
 2-1/2 percentage points less 1 percentage point.
 trend continues? would forecast say move
 9-1/2 percent funds rate accompanied proportional
 move long bond? kind differential effects would
 have?
 MR. PRELL. know, extreme flattening
 recent phenomenon. Earlier year, getting
 substantial increases long rates short rates rose. guess
 underlying projection, least mind, sense
 markets may overdone things recently part may
 lack long bond authority unusual tightness long end
 market point. would fairly
 substantial rise long rates along short rate increases
 forecast, partly presumption market
 surprised degree takes order damp
 inflationary pressures. would come around view;
 there's strict internal consistency forecasts.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 No, that's okay.
 
 MR. PRELL. rates don't rise--, might rise
 much number reasons. One could change
 inflationary expectations. may recently,
 apparent willingness Fed move earlier
 would thought may helped hold long-range inflation
 expectations. extent that's going on, you're perhaps
 getting significant real rate effect thus damping influence
 demand. events transpire cause real rates rise
 much would anticipate forecast, might
 different outcome investment demand may sustained bit
 [in forecast]. innumerable scenarios
 one could draw movement long rates would different
 implications.
 MR. JOHNSON. understand. I'm saying is, let's assume
 it's inflationary expectations adjusted, that's long
 rates haven't gone up. Say continues case,
 funds rate goes 9-1/2 percent without much change long
 bond due improvement inflationary expectations something like
 that. would differential impacts that?
 MR. PRELL. You're saying flattening occurs
 entirely reduced inflation expectations-MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Okay, entirely, let's say, debate
 
 extreme.
 MR. PRELL. would depend short run part
 whether change long-run perception
 inflationary trends would part whether
 reflection sense economy might headed toward
 recession. Clearly, historical experience we've seen
 marked flattening yield curve downturns
 economy. move short rates much we're talking
 long rate didn't rise all--that would
 steep downward slope. suspect would occur
 
 9/20/88
 
 circumstances people would perceive significant
 likelihood near-term weakening economy.
 MR. JOHNSON. view is, though, expectations
 revised near future long bond move
 back up?
 MR. PRELL. That's basically we're assuming. It's
 difficult psych market point. One come
 number alternative hypotheses market behaved
 way recently--in interpreting recent news on.
 Another factor dollar situation, terms longer-run
 external position think ultimately need correct
 that. That's probably factor that's going less favorable
 move along projection period. And, suggested, we're
 presuming market perceive greater degree
 restraint necessary rein inflationary pressures perhaps
 currently is. come around [unintelligible].
 MR. JOHNSON. that's case, long bond
 would surprised upward moves.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Mike, you've made think rather persuasive

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mike, would second speculate

 close indeed. think forecasts days little bit
 
 -12-
 
 9/20/88
 
 cloudier usual statistical difficulties
 drought, think need little careful forecasts
 generally.
 I'm happy see recent deceleration, although
 wouldn't want put lot credence couple months' data.
 think thing markets perhaps focusing
 still growing beyond potential. really what's
 guiding thinking judgment present time. response
 Governor Johnson, discussion yield
 30-year bond long-term rates generally, seems
 market may well underestimating strength
 economy thus reducing inflationary expectations. think
 generally tendency among market participants business
 people talk feel slowing economy slow
 economy. think we've gotten used large numbers past
 several quarters focus really potential
 economy. So, agree forecast, Mr. Chairman,
 agree analysis staff unless economy slows
 appreciably, restrain growth further--take additional
 [steps of] monetary restraint--by end year.
 don't think need say much District
 great deal changed since last meeting. Growth
 Sixth District remains fairly spotty. manufacturing tradeable
 goods sector quite well, service sector--particularly
 urban areas--is well really quite sluggish.
 Construction off. used report pretty regularly, said
 last month, almost every state exception Louisiana
 better national average. really turned
 around. think Florida would state would
 characterize better national average.
 unemployment rate states except Florida
 rest country. good news part that,
 suppose, there's little pressure wages kind
 market. probed lot among directors
 business people; hear little bit concern
 entry-level people trying attract higher wages,
 basically we're seeing wage pressure all. thing
 true generally prices. price increases,
 occurred, kind spotty industries really
 going flat out--paperboard, paper, on.
 good news Louisiana
 Mississippi better were. That's basically
 chemical production occurring Louisiana well
 pickup ship building. Although better,
 remember they're coming low base
 would still characterized, think, negative growth
 areas. agricultural side, higher prices agricultural
 commodities going improve farm incomes since crop yields
 affected southeast areas
 country. That's have, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. regard national economy--with
 modest adjustments fourth quarter year first
 
 -13-
 
 9/20/88
 
 quarter next year due mainly agriculture--our outlook quite
 consistent staff forecast Greenbook. regard

 District, there's really little that's new report.
 obvious exception agriculture, think economy continues
 
 really strong. signs moderation-nothing pronounced. think somewhat slower growth rates
 couple parts economy. Retail sales, example,
 much weaker summer months earlier spring.
 
 construction activity bit.
 

 
 Another example paperboard,
 
 course strong; string almost two
 years record monthly shipments, last month's shipments
 bit there.
 It's early tell early signs indicative
 trend they're going sustained. It's entirely possible,
 think, trends--particularly areas I've
 mentioned--are result exceptionally hot weather we've
 had. Since turn weather, I'm told retailers
 flow traffic stores back normal levels.
 things may weather related.
 Perhaps lack significant changes could good
 thing. Anecdotally, least, don't sense continuation
 upward pressures prices evident earlier
 year. still think risks much side
 greater inflation. beginning hear comments
 leveling prices variety materials--or certainly
 moderate increases taking place opposed big numbers
 earlier year. least one major manufacturer
 talked day forecasting raw material purchases
 next year level 1988--really increase all.
 Surprisingly, consistent Bob Forrestal
 said, don't sense deterioration wage front. Wage rates
 point seem accelerating. Also, doesn't
 seem hardening attitudes part labor. I'm told
 attitude organized labor continues
 constructive, given continued progress work-rule changes.
 think news continues pretty good. Companies
 losing ground unit labor costs but, caveat that,
 two major contracts currently reaching final
 stages negotiations. We'll wait see work
 out. Again, think it's early tell whether early signs
 moderation sustained. certainly favorable,
 could case things falling
 line pretty well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District economy
 appears growing relatively brisk pace, I'd say
 outlook District generally favorable. strong order
 book aircraft assure strength Seattle area
 couple years. also boosts prospects aircraft industry
 southern California. Prospects growth exports
 reasonably bright things agricultural products, specialty
 products, also transportation electronic equipment.
 Agriculture west appears though may actually

 west. time, signs weakness District really
 quite spotty. they're concentrated states--Alaska,
 Arizona, Utah--and industries well. Residential
 construction weak. Dairy livestock rather weak result
 aluminum
 fact they're paying higher costs feed.
 forest products weak due capacity constraints.
 It's rather
 interesting even weakness, it's areas
 pretty much capacity constraints: residential
 construction, example, that's solely result extremely strong
 export demands lumber. Weakness may intensify District
 recent sharp slowing retail advertising California-which looks quite pervasive--is precursor softer retail sales.
 may turn national outlook, it's view it's
 premature conclude recent softening economic statistics
 indicative trend persist 1989.
 Rather,
 seems likely interest rates remain
 present levels, growth nonfarm economy would probably exceed
 growth potential entire forecast period. Thus,
 prospects underlying rate inflation still concern,
 though obviously we're going see actual inflation rates buffeted
 expectation forecast correct,
 many special factors.
 seems process tightening probably
 resumed sometime soon. Thank you.

 don't great

 I'll
 briefly share [some comments] Committee, Mr. Chairman, partly
 difficult period read.

 last meeting didn't come economist businessman

 minutes got talking, discovered
 psychiatrist specializing depression. useful information
 counsels people, one first things asks
 information spending habits, particularly
 spending using little pieces plastic. he's
 discovered one early signs depression--that
 people go big spending sprees. buy cars--no,
 seriously--that can't afford.

 I've done that!
 
 MS. SEGER. I'm smart enough make up. buy
 cars can't afford, spending, run cards
 right limits--and go edge.

 MR. STERN.
 
 Another problem Federal Reserve.
 
 MR. BLACK.
 
 Another problem him; [profit?]
 
 that.
 MS. SEGER. Yes, that's right, he's okay. connection, though, anyone speak suggests
 consumers whole aren't big spending spree. guess
 view economy little less optimistic staff's.
 Also, housing side, realtors I've spoken
 suggest, first all, recent increases mortgage
 rates haven't felt; and, secondly, consumers
 beginning react high prices new homes. Also, certain
 parts country, like Mr. Parry's enlightened California,
 tremendous restrictions growth; it's difficult
 get lots build houses despite whining
 housing shortages. think forecast housing starts
 might touch high.

 Finally, think hinted discussion Mike Prell
 Ted Truman, I'm little less certain we're going get
 export improvement forecasting. would certainly like
 see because, certainly companies still competitive
 existing exchange rates [scenarios] involve slightly
 cheaper dollar, don't think everybody is. concerns me.
 three areas guess differ staff.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think every point wanted
 make made someone--but one person
 another. Let summarize briefly. agree closely
 staff suggested Greenbook. see signs
 moderation, partly employment figures
 national figures, also grass-roots reports
 we've getting directors, particularly textiles
 furniture.
 I'm glad see this, thought economy
 growing way, way fast risks upside.
 suggests maybe they're less upside
 before. like spoken, still think
 risks definitely skewed towards upside
 there's danger economy might overheat. figures
 showing moderation around month two most,
 apart housing, real large parts GNP
 accounts significant sectors show signs great
 sustained weakness.
 then, look figures section II
 Greenbook, show upward pressure wages
 prices. Mike reported figures implicit
 price deflator fixed-weight deflator second quarter
 worse thought were, based initial reports.
 short, feel little bit better before,
 signs slowing, don't think we're
 woods yet. would think staff's prognostication
 somewhere line we'll need tighten probably
 still right, although might time that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. There's little new report District
 economy. I'll try dispense quickly. I've
 commented before, District economy remains
 strong. obvious exception areas affected adversely
 drought; otherwise, economy District good shape.
 far national outlook concerned, find
 substantial agreement Greenbook forecast. don't know
 much rise interest rates might required stem
 building inflationary pressures, perhaps much, think
 Greenbook appropriately identify risks are.
 look latest statistics, think suggest
 slowing pace expansion last month two--a
 
 9/20/88
 
 -18-
 
 slowing that, several people already commented, welcomed,
 judgment. find there's maybe little tendency
 exaggerate this.
 Even though wouldn't try construe August
 labor market report strong, it's still 200,000 increase
 payroll employment--2-1/2 million workers annual rate--which
 trivial increase employment all, especially given
 tightness labor markets already exists.
 And, already
 suggested, inventory/sales ratios look, anything, low side
 me.
 think may see strength, least near
 term, coming inventories Greenbook forecast
 anticipates.

 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. region continues been:
 It's
 operating high levels, although moderation; labor
 markets tight; and, wage rates higher nation

 far national economy, subscribe view
 economy moderating, moderation needed
 additional restraint probably also needed. risks
 side much demand, think need point keep
 open mind shouldn't rush judgment reasons
 articulated nicely Mike Prell.
 I'd like watch
 economy closely prepared tighten necessary.
 wouldn't rush moment, enough doubts
 think little patience order.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 Mr. Chairman, Boston agree strongly
 staff's long-term conviction economy strong-its strength stemming net exports capital goods--that job
 Federal Reserve would try keep economy going
 beyond capacity levels generating new inflationary cycle.
 agree substantial increases interest rates likely
 required produce that.
 We're seeing little evidence slowdown recently,
 kind flow often get strong economy.
 don't think ought get minds we've reached
 level growth going compatible price
 stability.
 think it's short-term phenomenon we're talking
 about. think financial markets impacted

 Could comment meeting schedule next year

 know we-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. MORRIS. set eight-meeting schedule

 that, since we're controlling M1 presumably paying attention
 anything else, meet every month?
 seems
 Committee would well advised go back once-a-month
 schedule we're environment don't feel
 comfortable we're another meeting November 1st.
 It's rapidly changing world live think
 eight-meeting schedule few. It's true handle
 problems conference calls, doesn't quite substitute,
 mind, discipline gathering around table.
 know
 staff won't like increases work load, lot
 presidents won't like travel requirements.

 don't think considerations paramount. would
 strongly advise least think going back once-amonth schedule seems volatility world

 far New England economy concerned, we're

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

 Dallas.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. want make couple comments
 projections based money-driven model looks
 like. Essentially, I'd say projections similar
 Board's staff. differences second
 half year next year, would characterize pattern
 one inflationary pressures contained,
 significantly reduced, 18-month period.
 projections I'm
 talking based assumption 4 6 percent M1 growth.
 guess conclusion reached looking that--and
 obviously, model output then, Board staff
 does, subjective judgments made--was I'd much
 concerned about, say, money growth June July 9 percent,
 
 9/20/88
 
 -20-
 
 would August less 1 percent.
 think general
 pattern conclusion comes sort
 model--that risks upside downside.
 far District goes, report essentially last
 month. We're still showing weakness relative rest
 economy areas, particularly industries like textiles
 apparel, employment declines.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. respect
 Tenth District, great change last time.
 summarize, still trailing growth rate national
 economy. areas, including energy agriculture,
 improvement--to sure, improvement low base. Manufacturing well; retail sales holding
 vigorous. large, Tenth District continuing
 trend recovery, bit slower national rate.
 regard national economy projection contained Greenbook, would close except
 pattern bit different.
 understand Greenbook
 forecast, drought effect largely run course end
 year, whereas would find effect fairly even
 four quarters second quarter 1988 second
 quarter 1989. Notwithstanding minor difference, still seems
 projecting vigorous growth well 1989.
 And, given comments around table hear Tenth
 District respect wage price increases really showing
 yet, still matter major concern that, national
 level, we're putting considerable pressure resources.
 guess
 view going greater restraint
 future order get kind pattern longer term
 we'd like have.
 would also like add, may, happen agree
 Frank Morris--as painful personally
 travel--that going back monthly meeting schedule makes lot
 sense, given way we're operating moment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. District overall remains pretty strong,
 particularly manufacturing. slow delivery times
 particular industries, price increases coming across,
 nothing startling point, particularly capital
 goods area. Wage demands manufacturing side remained
 moderate, we're concerned strength
 service wage component--they're labor markets--that
 fact, they'll begin influencing we'll see sharper
 wage increases across board we're currently seeing. Retail
 sales ex-autos flat construction rather
 lackluster. know well, directors felt strongly
 strength economy, except last go-around
 quite adamant, probably noticed;
 saw
 deterioration concerns inflation. Nevertheless,
 there's still great strength District.
 
 -21-
 
 9/20/88
 
 far national economic outlook, guess really
 don't much reason disagree Mike's projections. However,
 estimate error it, would say error
 
 probably going upside terms strength
 inflationary pressures rather downside. We've seen
 inflation rate move 1/2 percent year. And,
 know, wrong direction perspective. think
 ought gear policy long-term objective, implies we'd
 
 probably face tightening--perhaps staff
 place.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. I'm pleased present state
 monetary policy conditions economy. doesn't mean
 like 4 percent rate inflation. didn't believe
 could make exchange rate adjustments necessary
 make--[along with] rebound oil prices lows
 rebound wage rates would call somewhat unsustainably
 low nominal rates--without temporary bounceback
 rate inflation. reason think staff's real
 economy forecast within range likely.
 would tend probably slightly higher net export figure, Ted-closer June Greenbook
 today--but there's enough argue much about. think
 anything different, consumer spending might slightly softer,
 it's difficult predict.
 pleasing aspect policy point September 1988
 that, far see, we've returned growth
 monetary aggregates pace occurring 1987--and
 thought rate 1987 appropriate provide soft
 landing dollar. it's encouraging see that,
 monetary aggregates responded somewhat easier stance
 maintained fall winter, aggregates
 responded way attempts serious
 letting M2 rise top target first year,
 even though somewhat distorted base level. looks
 M2 going end year fourth quarter
 midpoint could well low 4-1/2 5 percent
 end year. Kohn shakes head little bit that.
 think keep mind time lag interest rate
 changes response monetary aggregates.
 June, may remember, talked little bit
 hint changing commodity prices, think kind reading
 tea leaves point. we've evidence
 monetary restraint place impact commodity prices-and even though we've had, seems me, peaking commodity
 price rises earlier year, drought gave us kind
 double-peak effect. commodity price picture look much
 improved. believe fight inflation long one
 one must sustain long period time; would
 willing, course, accept low growth rates monetary
 aggregates, would really suggest zero may desirable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 -22-
 
 9/20/88
 
 MR.HELLER. Thank you. Let take little bit longer
 perspective current situation.
 1986, 15-1/2 percent
 M1 growth almost 10 percent M2 growth that, think,
 reflected extent inflationary bulge,
 working way economy producer prices slowly
 consumer prices. way, think lag exactly
 textbooks tell us is--18 months thereabouts, counting
 1986 area slightly middle 1988, variance
 around it.
 Then, following Governor Angell said, 1987
 saw substantial slowdown monetary growth think
 slowdown starting make felt real economy,
 observing right now.
 think many people pointed out, moderation
 economic growth picture Greenbook forecast. There's
 weakening, especially coming year. Personal
 consumption next year forecast 1-1/2 percent; residential
 construction negative; isn't one single sector
 growing 2-1/2 percent growth rate described
 optimal--except domestic investment exports. think it's
 absolutely essential, worry growth constraint,
 keep domestic investment growing solid rate. somewhat
 disconcerting, however, even growth rate sector
 forecast cut half coming year. So, we're
 kill goose lays golden eggs. can't talk
 growth constraint relevant policy one
 factor ease growth constraint, domestic
 investment, cut restrained.
 also agree exports
 maintained.
 I'm happy see higher export growth
 rates. current level dollar, think, entirely
 appropriate. We're purchasing power parity; therefore,
 competitive advantage make inroads
 foreign markets.
 scenario outlined Mike Prell response
 Governor Kelley's questions really scary one--the black box,
 Pandora's box, new President would face growth
 falters, higher interest rates we're talking
 about, tax revenues coming in.
 see
 downside risks unpalatable combination factors indeed.
 upside risks see rather minimal, items
 Governor Angell outlined already.
 view, we're seeing
 essentially moving economy inflationary bulge.
 look beginning process, you'll see positive
 signs--the commodity prices maintained, flattening

 good portents rather subdued inflationary expectations.
 So,
 think
 basically like economy way running right now.
 we're exactly right track would like everything
 possible keep moving way.

 [Coffee break]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Following Peter Sternlight's
 remarks borrowing requirements, think policy
 generally intermeeting period required little
 way adjustment. fact, it's rare outlook seems

 current economy vaguely reminiscent sag
 occurred 1976--which everyone assumed beginning
 decline, pause sort disappeared. bit
 way real slowdown. think we've got
 little careful we're looking false dawn.
 Export orders, unfilled orders still high. see
 evidence deterioration, even though there's slowdown

 markets remain quite strong. order structure, appropriations,
 seem deteriorating. true
