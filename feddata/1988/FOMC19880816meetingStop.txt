 MR. HOSKINS. one question. perceived
 markets changing way signal market participants
 want reserves want funds rate?
 making distinction customer System operations
 different? seems me, observe newspapers anyway,
 trying signal directly respect
 funds.
 MS. LOVETT. Well, think, part period
 effort let market know expectations carried
 rate beyond Committee voted, seemed way
 letting know that. reason, course,
 expectations could become embedded; trying signal
 really moving faster Committee instructed.
 longer things persist, people begin feel that--if
 expectations really get imbedded structure rates--when
 Committee meets again, may taken decisions it.
 felt necessary give signal rates seemed
 ratcheting higher. particularly true funds seemed
 getting sticky 7/8ths level.
 MR. HOSKINS. kind gets heart whether
 focusing borrowings funds rate that.
 MS. LOVETT.
 
 Right.
 
 Well, got borrowings.
 
 MR. KOHN. President Hoskins, discussing

 Thank you.
 
 Questions either
 
 8/16/88
 
 MR. PARRY. Ted, question net export
 number. small decline value dollar
 you're assuming, wouldn't model forecast typically give less
 improvement net exports you're showing?
 seems
 year it's something like $47 billion, next
 year it's $32 billion. least models I've seen would
 suggest kind small decline value
 dollar would significant slowing improvement
 net exports have. managed extent or-MR. TRUMAN. Well yes, think extent because,
 mentioned, encouraged seen first
 half year.
 So, given that, along anecdotes
 forth on, carried bit

 effect dollar alone forecast.

 MR. PARRY. least that's one area perhaps

 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Okay that, then.
 don't--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. I'm suggesting should, I'm saying
 think that's relevant measure. But-MR. PARRY. didn't take account,
 would misleading.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 think issue is--
 
 MR. PRELL. think thing consider that,
 sense, potential actual growth would lowered
 measured real growth would slower potential
 token.
 real growth would slower, resource utilization quotations
 short run wouldn't materially different. So, think
 getting distortions numbers, effect, baseto-base year measuring PDE prices--computer
 prices particular. think real crux matter

 much higher expected. That's what's
 really driving inflation forecast.
 MR. JOHNSON. Okay. you're suggesting, though,
 potential number changes way look deflator?
 MR. PRELL. Well, assert GNP growth

 presumably potential GNP growth also commensurately

 MR. PARRY. Isn't analytical issue raised
 may overstating inflation little bit--that actually

 bigger analytical issue area.
 MR. PRELL. Well, gets complicated, almost
 metaphysical, issues. I'm sure really problem
 sense overestimating.
 MR. JOHNSON. can't look fixed-weight one
 side only. seems you've got consistent. like
 say, believe deflator issue important growth
 side, looking implicit deflator otherwise-MR. PRELL.
 
 I'm sure; depends question.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.

 Well, think question--
 
 Well, it's almost apples oranges
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. get

 that's going go six weeks!

 Yes.
 
 Okay, stop.

 MR. HOSKINS.
 intrigued comments
 inflation might necessary get moving downward

 fact, forecast moving

 question: kind tightening mind terms

 MR. PRELL. Well, there're two things say.
 One,

 significant measure quarterly pattern food price increases,
 strong next spring tailing toward
 end year.
 second thing reflects particular
 pattern oil prices energy prices assumed

 MS. SEGER. Mike, could elaborate little bit

 It's hard hear

 MR. PRELL. Again, express recognize

 basically, rates getting level

 So, maybe tell kind mortgage-MR. PRELL. We've made modest downward revision

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions
 either gentleman?
 not, ready round robin.
 would like start off?
 MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll start Eleventh

 would say perception what's happening Texas

 think beginning see evidence showing

 Attitudinally, far financial situation

 remaining speculation whether last big one
 kind relief.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, economic activity District
 continues show think very, considerable strength. That's
 particularly true manufacturing sector, specifically
 activities either related exports capital
 goods operating levels continue very, high.
 steel industry, example, continuing run quite close
 capacity. third quarter normally period
 steel industry shuts bit deal maintenance,
 year maintenance deferred deal continuing demand.
 Chemicals paper continuing run high levels. Auto
 production schedules third quarter considerably higher
 third quarter last year. So, think capital
 expenditures side, Mike certainly covered well.
 think
 going see higher increases capital expenditures
 may forecast. I'm sensing lot companies
 really thinking adding significantly expenditure
 level.
 couple comments agricultural
 situation, crop estimates, you've seen.
 First,
 implements:
 Interestingly, got started drought thing,
 show implement sales.
 June holding
 pretty well; July numbers and, comparative
 basis, July sales tractors combines, example,
 considerably last year. That's surprising, certainly
 negative feature. Agricultural banks, second element
 agriculture comments:
 surveyed agricultural banks

 positive one expected be.
 weak producers
 weeded previous adjustment.
 credits books
 farmers strong enough deal drought
 without renewal significant problems among banks.
 me, surprising shift I've sensed
 last month two employment thing. been, think,
 quite modification attitudes there. now, think,
 quite persistently shortage [unintelligible].
 manufacturers
 talked running high levels, constraint
 really availability labor deal it.
 that's also
 case think service sector.
 talking somebody

 put applications, requests applications,
 flooded people. high standards

 Therefore,
 opened one stores significantly undermanned.
 
 -15-
 
 8/16/88
 
 talk people, seems shortage labor really
 beginning felt. couple key contracts
 negotiations started. think people
 following closely. sense wage
 side inflation picture going continue accelerate.
 going continue see increases wage costs.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Twelfth District
 economy continues grow healthy pace, particular strength

 growth appears

 California, Oregon Washington, employers difficulty

 also might say
 parenthetically California minimum wage rose $4.25

 Inventories satisfactory lean throughout

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, share Frank Morris's appreciation

 nothing monetary policy short run deal

 So, think need focus drought-adjusted figures

 I'm quite optimistic Ed Boehne was--and gather,

 third fourth quarters, particularly third quarter--our
 forecast bit higher. hate describe substantially

 roughly percentage point higher third quarter also
 somewhat higher fourth quarter. suggests last

 I've picked last days. comment involves

 that's little bit extra anecdotes you. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. seems everyone wants comment

 drought impact upon supply side production,
 also demand side. one really knows whether

 addition, Kohn talking about, reluctance bankers

 So, devise procedure
