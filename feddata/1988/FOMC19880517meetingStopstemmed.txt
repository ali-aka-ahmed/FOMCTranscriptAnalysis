 [secretari's note: transcript exist first part

 appendix.]
 chairman greenspan. littl problem
 brazilian negoti, divert jerri corrigan short
 while.
 he'll back, ask us get start event.
 listen rather close discuss had,
 strike fairli gener uniform view
 happen economi.
 think governor heller's view
 look elimin neg
 distinct accumul posit exactli right.
 on
 thing littl care recogn
 point, whenev get situat uniformli
 posit thi, turn.
 it's question turn.
 thing that's bother slightli outlook look
 it--not neg sens confirm sens--is that,
 particular stage cycl, run type
 acceler inflationari process forefront
 
 concern, think begin get signific
 inventori accumul. forc place it:
 name, intermedi price begin move gener awar
 aggreg demand. yet see either;
 acceler type commod price tend
 reflect imbal suppli demand.
 i'm argu
 commod price explan inflat side--where governor
 angel come from--but yet secondari followthrough metal price price, sinc
 stabil, indic inflat but, think,
 indic fact thing yet accumul.
 guess probabl will, don't think evid
 yet ha. data lead time, higher,
 don't yet suggest type tight see lot
 individu industri. process fear go
 creat fairli substanti acceler time, isn't
 moment--or least hasn't. i'd curiou--for
 specif insight thi, would appreci
 address issu specif, would,
 monetari discuss.
 don't think question
 next move make upsid.
 question, basic, whether
 next fomc meet basi certain conting.
 thing
 feel littl uncomfort answer question:
 weren't meet todai, particular date, would move
 would wait coupl week so?
 reason rais
 question market expect extrapol
 do.
 word, start move sharpli,
 expect jump quickli.
 i'm littl concern
 move fast, get significantli ahead curv,
 said. stock market think
 could get pretti shabbi. could get confid revers.
 so, come moment basic either:
 altern b asymmetr languag toward tighten,
 
 5/17/88
 
 fairli explicit expect appropri point would
 move up; go $100 million borrow, also
 asymmetr languag, think question realli get
 issu whether go $100 million $200 million next
 fomc meet. prefer would "b" asymmetr
 languag impli almost certainli move sometim
 intermeet period. don't think particular
 danger rais borrow $100 million now. frankli,
 think go $200 million now, top done alreadi,
 get edg littl riski rapid
 movement implicit extent market
 extrapol occur consequ. governor johnson.
 mr. johnson. i'm sort follow left
 tail end last discuss. i'd like throw hat
 ring concur chairman said. came
 meet, guess feel even littl moder
 that; although gener tend be--. walk last
 meet chang discuss convinc
 need move. time, came meet basic feel
 vote $100 million increas borrow
 averag last fomc meet made anoth $100 million
 increas borrow averag, occur.
 market realli absorb move, think. would
 unusu, probabl littl riski, immedi hit market
 meet anoth $100 million more,
 someth like altern c, market absorb--and
 think favor absorb--our last move. so, guess
 prepar come someth like chang, asymmetr
 languag provid flexibl move toward tighter polici
 mayb anoth $100 million increas borrow averag
 next intermeet period, think would probabl like.
 import issu would time. still tend favor
 approach, although guess could actual support $100 million
 move now. still think would import
 discret time filter market rather
 move immedi meet sinc we've absorb
 $100 million move borrow. would strongli go
 altern c coupl reason. on, think would
 shock market; prepar absorb that,
 think would even wonder thei're miss know.
 think better inform, don't see kind evid
 support kind move. secondli, think would rais
 immedi market anticip immin discount
 rate move. go $200 million borrow point-take borrow $600 million averag, would take
 fund rate probabl rang 7-1/2 percent plu, mayb
 7-3/4 percent--would immedi rais expect move
 discount rate. that's someth would like avoid. i'm
 ultim move discount rate to,
 think discount rate ought us mainli extra piec
 ammunit, import symbol even seriou situat,
 aris. would prefer simpli technic
 adjust alreadi taken place market.
 lose effect might want discount
 rate move later. so, would prefer creat expect
 immin move market. leewai still,
 think cautiou.
 
 5/17/88
 
 prefer, again, would chang,
 asymmetr languag understand probabl would
 immin move time sometim within next intermeet period.
 i'd leav chairman desk determin that.
 $100 million move would reason, would still prefer
 desk remain sensit filter
 market, given fact thei've absorb $100 million
 increas borrow last dai.
 don't know exactli
 put term "a", "b", "c"; mayb sai
 it's probabl somewher around "b".
 although guess
 prefer "b" asymmetr languag, could live "b"
 would involv $100 million borrow move,
 sensit desk's part.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid morri.
 
 mr. morri. well, mr. chairman, think 95 percent
 meet i've attend last 20 year would
 perfectli appropri make propos chang exist
 polici, light uncertainti exist time.
 think that's on reason we've alwai tend lag. i'm
 particularli concern, given present structur meet.
 went eight-meet system back time
 supposedli control m1 and, therefor, less need
 frequent consult.
 think ought reconsid
 realli interest rate control system, even though
 lot sentiment express last meet.
 next meet end june involv long intermeet
 interv kind situat. doesn't mean disagre
 recommend sort hedg posit here--go
 half wai, idea we'll look incom data
 next coupl week, perhap decid go whole hog. would
 suggest proper time would meet new
 order figur out.
 thesi right--that head
 steam build manufactur sector--then ought
 reflect pretti strong order figur. thei're strong,
 would signal for-chairman greenspan. pick purchas
 manag' survei; it's probabl sensit publish
 figur.
 mr. morri.
 you'd pick up.
 
 that's right; want wait two week
 
 chairman greenspan. get lead time, get
 qualit sens issu rais.
 mr. morri.
 term approach wai hedg
 posit--move half wai reconsid coupl week-that make good sens me. but, weren't go reconsid,
 would prefer go whole hog right now.
 mr. angel.
 
 whole hog mean "c" or--
 
 mr. morri.
 
 whole hog mean "c", ye.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid parri.
 
 5/17/88
 
 mr. parri. mr. chairman, ask us comment
 specif inventori. think probabl
 indic accumul inventori import good,
 
 that's respons higher price.
 
 regard good,
 
 recollect period late '70s occur
 bit lag factor. usual happen
 get pickup price index begin fuel
 
 expect; don't get realli rapid accumul
 inventori somewhat later.
 
 that, fact, correct,
 
 think mayb wait indic might littl
 danger.
 chairman greenspan. later; now.
 alreadi thi. cours, we're mai get
 june. haven't seen happen data.
 histor, would happen now.
 mr. parri.
 
 right?
 
 chairman greenspan.
 mr. parri.
 
 ye.
 
 well, thought delai.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 don't think so.
 
 mr. parri. case, see develop,
 particularli on we've mention--unemploy, capac
 util, m2, posit aggreg--it seem
 strong case support bluebook altern c.
 fact, can't imagin convinc case put us
 on put us staff. gener
 agreement staff's forecast; question it.
 seem explicit staff's forecast
 delai take action, we're go pai price later--conceiv,
 base upon know, term move even
 aggress. know mention we've move twice
 recent. two move 1/4 percentag point don't
 much. rememb earlier time when, get signific
 impact economi, on would move lot
 1/4 point. so, clear recommend would bluebook
 altern c. could see someth compromis move
 borrow mayb $100 million now. would hope
 would specif plan talk reconven coupl week
 see interven two week bring term data,
 think that, unless show weak, move
 again.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid stern.
 
 mr. stern. regard polici, think time
 question difficult on, suggest. market-certainli stock market mayb bond market well--probabl
 vulner move far fast. hand,
 thei're vulner delai long. don't know
 precis, perfect time kind action is. think
 longer-term goal point tri make earlier:
 whatev like happen wage price side,
 doesn't seem there's go deceler next year
 
 -5-
 
 5/17/88
 
 unless act.
 think time action,
 would favor second altern, go $100
 million now, asymmetr direct, expect
 probabl big shock market.
 fact, depend
 circumst, could welcom. happen
 depend data come in.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid forrest.
 
 mr. forrest. well, mr. chairman, everyth we've talk
 morn--the forecast, employ unemploy
 number, potenti wage price pressur--clearli
 pretti uniformli indic, think, risk upsid
 worri inflat. but, don't interpret
 last two action took recent unsubstanti.
 so,
 prefer would wait take action let
 two action work wai economi.
 all,
 latest action littl ago.
 now, hadn't taken
 action, i'd differ mind. but, moment,
 strong prefer wait--perhap long--mayb three
 four week, someth like that.
 so, would like stai
 $400 million borrow, asymmetr
 direct.
 would prepar support altern would
 move $100 million, $500 million, symmetr
 direct. would real problem move wai
 altern c point.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid hoskin.
 
 mr. hoskin.
 i'd like start sort recap
 see worldwid inflat rate.
 think look
 situat where, on reason anoth, inflat rate two
 major economi move toward our, instead
 move toward their. seem real
 loss ground. reason that; exceed
 monetari growth rate target, partli defens dollar.
 monetari growth rate seem give kind impetu
 spend economi would expect.
 don't see
 go awai time soon.
 so, worldwid,
 potenti trend discourag.
 term inflat
 rate--just reiter said earlier--we stall
 rate think high us, least state
 term object, price stabil. even staff
 forecast error, sens it's strong
 economi, seem we're still face prospect
 inflat stai current level rise. object
 price stabil, ought begin pursu object
 aggress.
 respect movement, size movement
 polici action, think sever issu surround
 discuss.
 on credibl polici. polici credibl
 mean market believ you're go sai you'll do.
 find difficult believ market believ rhetor
 price stabil long bond rate 9 percent.
 don't
 know happen morn, suspect
 advis peopl market, year ago, i'd sai
 economi look stronger thought, would see
 
 5/17/88
 
 rise inflat and, therefor, rise interest rate.
 would expect bond market sell off. back
 credibl issu: move now, convincingli, seem
 peak interest rate lower
 wait go forward increment step. second point
 credibl issu confus public and, perhap,
 mind. react small move noisi data come
 monthli, think public doesn't understand fulli
 we're try do. importantli, think convinc us
 abil control econom activ realli do.
 think monetari polici long-run polici, short-run polici.
 so, think market unsur us. gain
 credibl; think ought retain credibl.
 last, guess ought sai, given strength statement,
 
 prefer altern d.
 
 think i'll end there.
 
 chairman greenspan. i'll record "c" don't
 [unintellig] end! presid boehn.
 mr. boehn.
 think balanc notion
 go, think tighten, without
 
 disrupt market.
 
 best balanc, point view,
 
 would rais borrow $100 million now. sai now, don't
 mean tomorrow; would think would give desk
 would
 discret work next week 10 dai.
 
 asymmetr direct would stack deck
 direct tighten, still wait see incom inform.
 
 guess put kind "b", "c+", asymmetr
 direct.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor heller.
 
 mr. heller. i'd like get back middl target
 rang monetari aggreg--not instantli, gradual.
 fulli agre chairman's view: altern b asymmetr
 languag $100 million borrow.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 mean $100 million point
 
 between--
 
 mr. heller.
 
 point--you feed slowli.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid guffei.
 
 mr. guffei. mr. chairman, would join
 concern upward interest rate movement. howev, seem
 risk upsid, there's enough room take
 anoth cut restraint without disrupt market.
 result, would like associ would opt b-c
 altern, $500 million borrow; i'd also
 includ asymmetr languag toward restraint.
 focu move $400 million $500 million, would
 note season credit taken normal track increas
 rather dramat sinc last meet someth less
 $100 million to--i don't know close period,
 time $200 million. $400 million
 object borrow, $200 million season,
 realli depend upon view season--whether it's
 
 5/17/88
 
 sensit interest rate level not. realli believ
 move $500 million rather promptli major move, given
 makeup borrow level $500 million. result, go
 $500 million then, asymmetr languag, would permit us move
 toward c altern depend upon incom inform
 mai two week. would prescript.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. think question ask
 want wait is: wait see? think
 good question. i'm sympathet notion give
 mislead signal regard appear
 focus make move. seem
 staff forecast accur, point time discount rate
 chang would part move. point
 take place, cours, could take place point
 time open market committe meet. factor
 would make us think would need much chang,
 seem ought rule out. so, don't see todai
 necessarili time move. would strong prefer
 kind signal us. happen like someth
 altern c veri, well. like altern c
 m2 growth path. frankli, would like us look
 carefulli, and, thought could wait, noth
 regard borrow target move. would accept
 don't think know stage happen
 monei growth would anticip move made.
 certainli, april month knew wasn't go give us
 clear read monetari aggreg; mai look like might
 consist "c"; june doesn't follow path, frankli,
 i'd like factor would caus us make
 move. sai keep view abl
 achiev movement price level stabil allow
 exchang valu dollar fall further. believ
 altern c growth path monetari aggreg would
 consist stabl dollar short-term horizon, i'd
 like kind restraint. certainli feel comfort
 chairman--he shown alreadi respons
 forc could make move see
 altern. so, it's okai strong tilt
 direct chang todai borrow target,
 provid assur readi act
 monetari growth rate return thought
 good path 1987. hindsight sai wasn't bad.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid keehn.
 
 mr. keehn. mr. chairman, feel littl ambival,
 certainli regard direct, regard question
 time. talk lot. ed boehn phrase much
 wai would. would move borrow todai,
 think would pretti quick last move might perhap
 signal littl market would intend. want
 orderli wai. so, would bring level $100
 million soon think market accommod that; don't
 know whether that's week two week, someth like that.
 certainli, i'd favor asymmetr languag upward bia
 
 5/17/88
 
 polici direct. think it's possibl,
 like, move second $100 million next
 meet committe. whether confer call
 leav entir you, i'm indiffer.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. i'm favor "b", includ idea ad
 $100 million borrow target eventu, mani
 reason chairman mention. main reason is, again,
 two tighten move recent week i'm
 i'd
 sure market fulli digest move.
 surpris real economi taken account
 monetari aggreg begun reflect them. also,
 mention befor, think ought pai attent stock
 think lot nervous still there, least
 market.
 mani case, institut small
 among lot institut.
 investor taken walk. haven't heard anyon mention
 thrift industri, think that's disast area,
 bob boykin, i'm sure,
 someth pai attent to.
 speak that, number us; much tighten
 can't imagin
 soon, think, would make greater disast.
 ldc debt situat would improv dramat tighten
 much. also, read tabl growth monetari
 aggreg, seem aggreg expect slow
 still think inventori
 whether go "b" "c".
 don't know be--i'm
 correct card.
 smart; think excess go
 work off. fact, interest rate get higher, give

 busi peopl stronger incent run less inventori.
 think
 could live asymmetr languag well.
 summar it.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, think staff made
 it's true
 excel case forecast earli move.
 made coupl move recent, think time
 appropri. rememb mani time sit around
 tabl appar stage busi cycl
 think ought
 tradition made largest mistak.
 move now. think you've given us wise counsel suggest
 hold $100 million increas borrow reserv figur;
 would bui that, asymmetr direct. i'd like get rid
 think that's unduli
 languag unusu flexibl.
 fuzzi confus peopl. i'd like keep open option
 would go $100 million if, two three week,
 short, "b".
 look need to.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor kellei.
 
 mr. kellei. mr. chairman, bob forrest spoke
 minut ago wish next on list
 think it's time wait,
 could simpli said "me too."
 given evid date two recent move, agre
 would favor "b" keep
 insignific.
 borrow now, asymmetr languag. but, bob
 
 5/17/88
 
 suggest, i'd comfort go addit $100 million
 symmetr languag.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid boykin.
 
 mr. boykin. agre posit state
 i'm "b-", "c+", howev
 you, mr. chairman, other.
 guess
 character it, $100 million increas borrow.
 would inclin move sooner rather later $100
 million.
 real courag convict, lee hoskin
 doe, would realli like line him. guess don't
 much courag, given situat
 southwest. but, think make veri, good point polici,
 do, view longer run.
 think tempor ration short-run
 problem think would result take action, that's realli
 commun tend compound problem longer rang.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 vice chairman.
 
 vice chairman corrigan. well, instinct probabl
 same, think financi market reason, noth els,
 i'd will sneak it. me, would mean $100
 million asymmetr languag, although could live
 arrang peter flexibl term
 but, certainli, feel strongli
 edg $100 million in.
 get first $100 million promptli. think
 two chang polici made last sever
 week clearli view favor market
 indic inde prepar respond condit.
 agre bob parri that, insofar economi concern,
 think kohn
 doubt thei've done much anyth.
 made point wai, earlier on, point nomin
 real interest rate--even move--ar preciou littl
 differ year ago. interven
 year, economi grown rate simpli won't work
 prospect.
 also nag fear here--i don't know
 staff's view ar--that highli mobil monei
 capit market worldwid basi, mai take higher
 level interest rate achiev given degre restraint
 real world. case, problem lie ahead,
 especi context governor seger's comment thrift
 lot thing, would difficult
 damag. precis reason feel
 strongli move right thing do.
 agre
 comment made governor johnson, think coffe break,
 lee hoskin minut ago: we've got avoid fine
 tune here; broad thrust develop next six
 seven quarter keep mind. that, too, sai
 ought move now.
 also agre governor johnson
 discount rate question. situat right
 now--where we're upsid cycl don't
 worri friction level borrow--i don't see
 kind prejudic discount rate [increas]
 downsid, run friction borrow
 problem. so, don't see presumpt whatsoev,
 least judgment, move--perhap even far fullblown "c"--that would creat strong bia toward move
 
 5/17/88
 
 -10-
 
 discount rate. inde, phase thing we're in, like
 governor johnson, person--not final sai
 discount rate--would try keep powder dry discount rate
 work market much possibl. think
 two thing: on, minim danger market disrupt;
 secondli, leav us stronger posit someth realli
 advers develop next month two, whatev. summar,
 mr. chairman, would $100 million now, asymmetr
 direct. that's it.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid melzer.
 
 mr. melzer. i've follow move taken,
 sens that, effect, rather small follow
 move. think point we're go step front
 situat everyth we've heard todai correct.
 that's go take someth order altern c.
 time issu talk about.
 would guess--and again, mr.
 chairman, think right thing move within
 latitud--that benefit discuss might
 move full 50 basi point, wouldn't get two
 increment 25 basi point. view think
 get front make strong statement, would favor "c";
 could certainli accept "b" asymmetr languag--$100
 million $100 million later.
 chairman greenspan. tabul result, everyon
 believ, best judg, next move higher.
 thing basic differ whether move move
 short period. would like suggest that, i've
 written correctli heard everybodi, seem
 consensu altern b asymmetr languag, fairli
 strong willing--desir, put wai--to give
 instruct chairman desk move next
 period. would interpret mean that, unless see event
 clearli contrari gener consensu outlook
 on hear todai, it's almost automat increas.
 strong, think convinc, case made
 not, condit, allow get behind power
 curv question. would sai further--in line
 issu frank rais frequenc meet--that
 anyth moment aris suggest need telephon
 meet, think should. would substitut come
 grip reschedul question. don't think there's
 doubt sensit polici period; think
 close discuss judgment probabl go need
 interv shorter schedul fomc meet. so, i'd like
 suggest, hope norm would find appropri languag-i'm sorri, there's on thing forget. unfortun, got

 right there. again, i'd sai short experi i've

 respect constraint itself, there's suggest
 four-quarter move averag, troubl sens:

 growth rate monetari base fourth quarter 1982

 mr. johnson. well, go follow
 there's much difficult technic issu. even agre

 want, think probabl almost everybodi would sai

 you'd run kind problem, like: mean

 there's oil price shock, on big rel price

 price shock, you're go potenti overshoot;
 filter economi, it's go creat overreact
 downsid point, you're go try

 so, me, price stabil mean long-run concept.
 mai mean you're never actual experienc perfect level

 price stabil price hover around zero.
 mean mean somewhat around zero; even you'd

 could debat whether peopl think ought go period
 deflat order keep mean around zero.
 get
 kind difficult debat proper measur price
 stabil is.
 broad index cpi, ppi, deflat?
 it?
 it's difficult problem. still think goal
 price stabil, rather than, sai, try improv
 unemploy rate maxim real output growth, step
 right direct.
 think time, probabl, wasn't
 clear; peopl would said phillip's curv trade
 accept perman inflat worthwhil.

 don't think that's true anymor, still think
 difficult problem.
 get hung goal, want sai
 specif propos, though, think would succe
 damp volatil base. upper lower bound

 you're approach bound rather deal big roller coaster
 effect, would probabl damp volatil base growth.
 you'd much stabl growth base; think would
 succe that.
 question would whether get

 think ultim issu whether specif

 seriou monei demand problem associ m2.
 big problem
 convinc monei demand stabl, even long

 look experienc 1980s.
 statist studi past found long-run break

 look back earlier postwar period; decad
 monetari veloc actual declin trend.

 turn postwar period. sever detect

 predict break occur, that's difficult
 problem. feel satisfi statist properti
 base sudden could structur

 even though

 so, think fundament problem

 peopl want target monetari aggreg highli

 those-mr. melzer.
 
 look?
 
 mr. kellei. well, chart board's staff
 put annual growth rate month-by-month basi;
 
 5/17/88

 doesn't go back far go back year; includ

 sai quarter would permit

 four last five quarter--take liberti includ

 could protect phenomenon?
 mr. melzer. propos envis averag

 look growth rate, mike?
 mr. kellei.
 
 ye.
 
 so, first all, would first
 mr. melzer. okai.
 month on quarter talk impli term
 level averag quarter?
 mr. heller. ye, mike sai look first month,
 you're realli-mr. melzer.
 right now.
 
 well, let put context
 
 mr. kellei. look first month, it's like
 kind thing peter deal everi dai, regard
 mainten period. instanc, let's take octob: octob
 number 11 percent annual basi.
 follow
 novemb 6.9 percent decemb 3.1 percent; averag
 fine.
 sat look 11 percent
 octob might move someth precipit.
 mr. melzer. well, first all, think staff would
 abil project expect happen term
 growth [vi-a-vi] try hit averag

 look
 right quarter, probabl right at, precious
 close to, level would permit 9 percent upward
 bound.
 mr. kellei.
 
 april 12.3 percent.
 
 mr. melzer. okai. can't look monthli
 growth rate; think look level. and, look
 correctli--i'm look st. loui base--we roughli
 think 9 percent constraint would be, littl
 it.
 so, would ask meet like thi:

 mr. melzer.
