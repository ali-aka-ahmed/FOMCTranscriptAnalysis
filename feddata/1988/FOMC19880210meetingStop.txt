 MESSRS. PRELL & TRUMAN.
 
 [Statements--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ted, alternative C,
 interest rate movements?
 3 percent?
 2 percent?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Yes,
 
 [unintelligible].
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions two gentlemen?
 
 SPEAKER(?).
 Mike, pattern inventories pretty
 critical forecast think you've made effective case
 going go considered drastic
 inventory cycle. thing strikes that, really,
 almost best possible worlds nonfarm inventories
 basically cycle. wonder it's likely
 would greater reaction terms production
 you've shown, case might somewhat weaker growth
 first half.
 MR. PRELL. see this, don't believe
 overhangs widespread large.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 agree you.
 
 MR. PRELL. automobiles--indeed, automobile
 inventory reduction progressing bit faster
 anticipated, since auto sales January stronger
 built first-quarter forecast.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. PRELL.
 It's conceivable, certainly extent
 isn't response early excessive inventory
 accumulation, could build larger problem,
 subsequently could give us cycle.
 [Unintelligible] we'd
 even dramatic inventory correction earlier
 upswing--and number short-run corrections-and, course, that's critical ingredient.
 SPEAKER(?).
 Following inventory question--the
 distinction manufacturing inventories retail inventories.
 think show charts consistent
 anecdotal evidence one picks up.
 However, there's one area
 I, least, haven't able get much anecdotal evidence.
 mentioned I've heard elsewhere.
 accumulation retail inventories planned--was desired
 effect--to beat higher prices imports.
 Could expound that?
 MR. PRELL. Well, think that's hard pin down.
 isn't prices, also perhaps case apparel
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 earlier part last year, concerns quota restrictions.
 general issue prices whether manufacturers, example,
 saw materials input prices increasing sharply cases,
 [since] interest rates looked negative real terms, whether one
 saw effort accumulate inventories manufacturing sector.
 accumulation. wasn't faster; fact, slower,
 increase output. it's inconceivable
 could still significant desire build inventories
 further. moderate accumulation manufacturers'
 stocks. example, latest purchasing managers' report
 January, explicit comment effect
 reaction shortages goods lengthier
 delivery times, also anticipatory price increases.
 MR. HOSKINS. Mike, don't know whether
 appropriate question you, maybe later discussion,
 first monetary policy objective states, essentially, want
 maximum output without significant acceleration inflation. One
 could reverse say want achieve deceleration
 inflation without significantly damaging employment output.
 choose assumption discuss assumption?
 MR. PRELL. Well, suppose certainly something
 don't think we've
 fundamental Committee's decision-making.
 misread Committee behaved terms putting
 significant importance maintaining growth avoiding increases
 unemployment.
 terms overall resource utilization:
 anything significantly slower GNP growth would
 conjectural
 basically bring greater degree slack.
 whether precisely captured desires Committee,
 ultimately, ended forecast sort gave
 much growth think get without putting enough pressure
 economy get real momentum developing inflation
 process.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 [Mr. Morris.]
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 two questions, Mr. Chairman. One,
 part forecast problem business fixed
 investment.
 [Given] sustained strength manufacturing sector,
 except maybe automobiles, staff showing manufacturing
 industry operating higher levels capacity. going
 produce, unfortunately think, price strains year goes
 on. staff projection shows deceleration business fixed
 investment last year. Now, find hard reconcile
 normal cyclical patterns also orders figures
 projection real plant equipment
 past four months.
 spending 2.9 percent annual rate nondefense capital goods
 3.5 percent annual rate.
 unusually strong
 increases; would lead conclude discount
 plant equipment surveys bit date [not]
 factor bigger increase fixed investment year.
 MR. PRELL. Indeed, plant equipment surveys would
 suggest stronger year-over-year gain nominal
 business fixed investment. surveys, know, taken
 stock market [developments] probably fully assessed.
 think consistent
 Commerce surveys overlap that.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 general output growth path terms usual
 accelerator effects. don't particularly favorable
 developments .the cost capital. think areas
 significant strength, I've tried relate areas
 capacity utilization. hand, areas
 economy, right overall level pattern
 demand, stimulus investment great.
 Obviously, financial sector, shrinking, probably
 going buying many computers office
 equipment.
 Demand office space may lower.
 drags
 number sectors business fixed investment see it:
 office area general, hotels, probably areas missed
 commercial construction. balanced divergent
 elements think forecast really consistent
 historical patterns, given overall level growth final demand
 financial commitments.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, Mike, problem
 new orders series, sense orders placed
 domestic facilities.
 big part strength
 aircraft orders, substantial part exports
 long forward 1989-1990 deliveries.
 There's awful lot export
 demand numbers well as, probably, tilting
 proportion imports domestic purchases.
 probably
 getting upward bias nondefense capital goods shipment
 figures orders figures.
 would suspect one makes
 types adjustments exactly numbers, one comes
 close Mike's numbers coming out.
 SPEAKER(?).
 Well, may be; looked
 series capital goods area, know least,
 differentiate domestic foreign orders--in machine tools.

 big rise December machine tool orders; it's almost
 entirely domestic orders.
 MR. PRELL. question whether indicative
 what's going domestic demands.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. evidence that.
 get strong export demand, orders coming in.
 see in-MR. PRELL.
 think Chairman's remarks raise
 important point trade picture.
 look nondefense
 capital goods orders, average lead time--when take
 aircraft, really enormous backlogs keep
 business well 1990s--showed substantial growth
 earlier part last year. think may shown
 Greenbook. fourth-quarter increase wasn't really
 great.
 caution-SPEAKER(?).
 
 I'm skeptical fourth-quarter number.
 
 MR. PRELL.
 It's volatile series month-to-month.
 think, perhaps terms leading indicator value--and
 probably doesn't point far future--that it's one little
 hint may moderation area.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 SPEAKER(?).
 Isn't consensus forecast P&E probably
 excess 5 percent growth? forecasts, I've seen
 least, much strength.
 MR. PRELL. I'd look. think BFI forecast
 much line major ones.
 example, 1988 forecast, 4.5 percent--[turning
 staff] annual average? DRI 5.1; Bluechip
 indicators 5.1. They're comparable; it's small difference.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Truman?
 
 SPEAKER(?). Looking long-term interest rates
 Germany, real long-term rates unusually high. some-MR. TRUMAN. Well, think it's puzzling. ask
 Germans they're high, say German savers won't accept
 interest rates lower 6 percent assume
 long-term inflation rate much higher currently.
 matter talk way around that, that's answer get
 back. true even last year, couple
 years, [market] interest rates come down, [rates]
 stayed 6 percent. fact, series used
 slightly understates movements rates, it's average
 longer-term ten-year public authority issues.
 much less ten years maturity.
 sluggishness series. example, ten-year bonds
 outstanding, rate 6 percent, 6-1/4 percent.
 come bit series showed recently,
 still high. savings story,
 people would point critical imperfections cartelization
 financial markets Germany; it's much explanation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Yes. Since President Hoskins mentioned
 monetary policy objectives, guess I'd like make even stronger
 statement regard that. way stated somewhat
 different it's written. way stated less offensive
 way it's written. way it's written contrary
 everything believe job is, causes
 wonder: missed something two years
 stated before?
 MS. SEGER.
 
 It's Employment Act '46.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Whatever is, seems that's
 objective is, always going edge
 disaster. don't know else put it. Back chart 19--and
 want Presidents realize I'm impressed
 scholarship forecast, indicated
 staff--but haven't yet seen happens chart 19
 unchanged dollar tighter U.S. monetary policy. Now, presume
 means money growth like 1987.

 approximately correct?
 MR. KOHN. '88 would same; '89
 would several percentage points less.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 words, M2 growth '88
 scenario would 4 percent?
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Approximately.
 would '89?
 One two percent guess--in area.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Oh!
 see. quite restrictive path.
 bothers outcome.
 disagree regard
 sign result interest rates.
 would seem me,
 adopted smaller money growth path lower real GNP
 detailed here, fed funds rate might 2 3 percent less
 than, rather 2 3 percent greater than. Would comment
 that?
 SPEAKER(?).
 think exercise involved moving
 interest rates impacts economy back money
 demand, measured standard money demand equations.
 way works, lots ways cutting this. But,
 essentially, slowdown nominal GNP, 1-1/2
 percentage points year--a little less, 1-1/4--is associated
 kind interest rate rise one hand, get sharp
 reduction, too, partly colleagues
 saying quite while--because considerable interest
 elasticity money numbers.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, apparently it's model. guess
 time time bothers me. model use
 close model way would assume economy works.
 MR. KOHN. Ultimately, think one differentiate
 short-run simulation that's presented here--where slow
 money growth, interest rates go up, slows demand
 money real economy--and longer-run effect might
 slow money growth, ultimately get price level down,
 would lower inflation would come back
 trend rate growth economy.
 fact, models
 characteristic: slow money growth, would
 come back to, essentially, trend rate growth economy
 whole. may remember discussion yesterday [during
 staff briefing Board], question function
 economic forecasts whole. characteristic.
 short run, wouldn't pay much attention extent
 tighter monetary policy; would give calibration
 kind monetary policy would produce.
 MR. ANGELL. guess depends upon soon expect
 expectations realized. model would using would
 different chain events.
 would seem me-SPEAKER(?).
 Yes, could see
 consumer prices measure 1988.
 thought
 big expectational component rate inflation,
 slower, deliberately slower, monetary growth--of course,
 something difficult capture model--you would get much

 would lower interest rates.
 
 fact,
 
 consider somewhat important,
 MR. ANGELL.
 believed fast growth rate money stock would
 result lower interest rates, would inclined choose

 SPEAKER(?).
 
 short run.
 
 MR. PRELL. Governor Angell, let say--I don't want
 unduly defensive assumption--we aren't making
 normative prescription Committee. tried emphasize,
 saw economy current position, looked question
 much room growth was. sense, us,
 issues forecast context sort asymmetrical-we looking much room felt grow without
 moving inflation trend much away been. That's
 trying communicate assumption.
 MR. ANGELL. would admit, wouldn't Mike, "C"
 isn't pretty picture?
 MR. PRELL. Well, one, think question
 think always run
 dynamics expectational effects.
 question take account tighter policy. always
 requires higher interest rates short run. get
 lower growth money balances line desired levels,
 could get different paths thereafter.
 best guess, using models, difference would

 trying give sense sensitivity forecast

 MR. ANGELL. Well, seems sounder money

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I've Frank Morris' camp
 thinking expenditures plant equipment, along net
 exports goods services, would real driving force
 economy. pointed may overlooked foreign part
 that. would suggest one two, anyway,
 increases good deal.
 guess thing puzzled much
 fourth-quarter figures released sharp decline
 producers' durable equipment. One contacts specializes
 watching computer industry attributed
 feels
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 much weaker pattern expenditures really had.
 sound sensible?
 MR. PRELL. great deal commentary
 number. 1 think pointed out, perhaps Greenbook,
 subsequent shipments data surface looked stronger
 BEA this. translation, limited data
 have, complicated one. shipments exports
 well domestic purchases; intermediate goods,
 shouldn't show end; questions seasonal
 patterns seasonal adjustment goes
 tax law changes. P&E number dragged automobile
 sales, part shipments data. So, it's
 complicated calculation. guess, certainly expect
 revise degree, isn't clear won't still end
 decline P&E fourth quarter.
 MR. BLACK. guess still find hard believe view
 thought happening. know mentioned
 Greenbook good part computer equipment. that's
 reason raise question
 different
 way computer companies report figures.
 don't know whether truth fellow said not,
 seemed know talking about. confirmed
 suspicions, though hoping could lend support
 hypothesis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 concerned
 competitors looking Department Commerce series

 guess sorts rumors serious-MR. BLACK.
 
 fellow said talked
 
 probably
 exact reason; hadn't thought that,
 [unintelligible]-SPEAKER(?). Yes, thought decline 3.8 percent.
 read one [correctly,] it's 7.2 percent fourth
 quarter. get 3.8?
 MR. PRELL. PDE decline 7 percent. It's 3.6 percent
 total BFI fourth quarter. I'd like emphasize
 seasonal adjustment phenomenon bounce numbers around
 time future. old depreciation rules, company
 could buy something December get, guess, half year's
 depreciation. tax reform, pile much fourth
 quarter tax purposes, penalized. seasonal
 factors last several years--as may recall, seen
 wild fourth quarter-first quarter swings--were probably beginning
 capture wrong time, incentive
 eliminated. could bounce numbers around future.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 That's good point.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 SPEAKER(?).
 [It could affect the] third-quarter/fourthquarter swing now, third quarter 2.6
 percent.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. Well, ever since briefing yesterday, Mike,
 I've trying figure can't understand point
 fourth-quarter GNP numbers came out--which showed weaker
 consumption spending greater inventory accumulation believe
 forecast--how numbers,

 upward revision forecast first half year.
 must say arithmetic still flies right me. So, maybe
 try convince it; I'm sure it's density
 today that's it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 unsustainable.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 explanation
 
 [unintelligible]
 
 It's reversing.
 
 MR. PRELL. don't exactly go clean slate
 time.
 certain follow-through earlier
 guess didn't feeling overall
 [forecasts].
 production growth going tail quite fast built
 [earlier], based orders trends employment data
 end year. sense consumer spending
 looking weak
 falling apart year ended.
 early fall didn't show much growth end year,
 didn't seem falling apart. surmised that,
 everything else could look at, probably stock market
 psychological effects great might feared
 would be. forecast drastic change means
 last forecast; we're talking two-tenths percent overall GNP.
 certain amount arithmetic momentum this.
 don't
 view change first half great change.
 noted last time, perceive slowing first half come
 two ways: either final demand weak producers
 react really fast inventories build up;
 inventories would begin build we'd see adjustment
 production process. sort got second [from the]
 emerging data; final sales fourth quarter somewhat
 disappointing. outcome, there's
 slightly different story.
 MS. SEGER. second question--maybe Mr. Truman-involves assumption dollar. likely
 year?
 agreement thought struck
 major nations called drawing halt dollar's decline,
 supposed take seriously forecast 10 percent decline
 weighted-average value dollar year, followed [a
 decline of] 8 percent next year?
 sure match
 thought basic objectives were.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, it's little less 10 percent,
 depending start from.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Ten fourth quarter?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, lot time
 December 22 Greenbook. change average January
 10 percent. is, fact, one reasons
 presented last chart middle panel it. you'd
 think somehow dollar really problem, way set
 say, impact would be--you wouldn't see
 much difference 1988. minimum, said comments,
 dollar going go down, you're going get much
 
 difference [as may seen] chart. [if] everybody seems
 happy current account deficit, it, they're
 probably going less thought. looking forward
 1989, might want easier monetary policy--that's
 chart designed deal with--where stronger dollar
 brought difference policy assumption
 staff sometimes calls levitation. It's risky business
 forecasting exchange rates, make sort
 assumption. find useful make assumption
 eventually price adjustment take place. there's
 reason essential, within time frame forecast,

 MS. SEGER. like idea alternative scenarios,
 looking got thinking whether assumption
 flying face deal. final question
 estimate real GNP G-10 countries running
 forecasted real GNP growth year--1988 1989. makes
 wonder export boom, whether that, fact,
 materialize extent talking about.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, forecast slightly different
 one year. "export boom" only,
 essentially, 1987.
 MS. SEGER. Well, one time, remember,
 lecturing countries speed economies
 would help us peddle goods overseas.
 MR. TRUMAN.

 MS. SEGER.
 
 We'd better go Dale Carnegie.
 
 Okay, thank
 
 you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. KEEHN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 [I want address] capital expenditure
 
 issues Frank Morris Bob Black raised different way.
 Looking utilization rates chart 7, rates
 getting pretty high. guess question is: history
 tell us? industries, particularly textiles, chemicals, paper,
 steel, operating high levels--and
 averages industry, suggests operating

 MR. PRELL. Well, don't think history identifies clear

 indicated, story hesitancy part

 also uncover stories that, yes, plants operating high
 levels capacity, capacity expanded removing
 bottlenecks. expecting fairly sizable gains paper
 chemicals.
 MR. KEEHN(?).
 
 Paper moving?
 
 MR. PRELL. Yes. Even couple years ago
 probably already signs movement paper industry, involving
 plans putting production [capacity] service.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. I'd like go back question
 inventories distribution business around world. Assuming
 there's going sort inventory cycle type
 forecast, even greater: sense
 extent could take comfort that's going result greater
 slowing production abroad domestically--given we,
 course, importing lot used to?
 MR. PRELL. difficult question. sorted
 data tried put finger many
 dollars' worth imports inventory overhang.
 least arithmetically, appears presently retail
 sector; doesn't amount lot dollars, best assess.
 It's probably small proportion would significant
 factor.
 MR. TRUMAN. give example, think one number
 spread
 came something like $2 billion plus.
 four quarters, lets say, 1988, it's well within
 may there;
 noise factor monthly trade numbers.
 sense, built forecast lower
 level imports general--that's part cost production.
 But, first half year, based know now, it's
 going show decisively import numbers.
 And,
 therefore, going set mini-cycle rest

 MR. STERN. Well, side it, extent
 domestic industry going benefit that?
 MR. PRELL. think domestic industry, net,

 relatively higher import ingredient.
 think that, terms foreign economic activity, it's probably
 second-order factor.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. going ask Ted Truman
 question Governor Seger raised respect real growth
 abroad.
 guess Ted basically answered question,
 could take step further: Since basically exportdriven forecast, countries like Germany France Italy,
 particularly Germany, responsive
 overtures, fall short--I don't mean recession short
 growth patterns expect--is forecast serious trouble?
 guess would add that, given weight trade Japan
 Canada, apparently could carry lot it; wouldn't expect
 fall short.
 suppose countries did, would
 expect forecast come-MR. TRUMAN. Well, wouldn't want suggest
 difference 2 percent growth zero wouldn't effect
 forecast.
 would something order
 [unintelligible].
 1 percent lower growth throughout
 period G-10 countries, would say could produce something like

 That's relatively

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. address question?
 It's
 interesting question whether strictly exportdriven growth forecast. course, crucial numbers

 implies basically consumption levels higher

 Nonetheless, re-estimate

 crucial question, comfortable feel

 judgment correct would

 MR. PRELL.
 Let address way started

 would naturally follow would tend monetary

 would tend, short run, slightly higher saving rate.
 think potential would fairly high marginal propensity-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. [Unintelligible] COLA social

 MR. PRELL. Yes, think it's question
 quickly occurs. one looks average saving rate
 year versus average last year--let alone
 middle couple quarters last year versus year--I think there's
 noticeable increase saving rate. it's one
 view generally consistent kind wealth effect

 noticed last half month so, definite deterioration

 why, they're essentially complaining can't get enough
 input. I've tried probe this--admittedly truly
 representative sample, people--and it's kind
 logic says things good get worse.

 guess that's human nature.
 People tell seen

 individual sectors: first, agricultural part District
 clearly showing signs improvement. Land values rose last year,
 fourth quarter values stabilized higher levels;
 we've seen lot land transactions--enough purchases taking place

 Commodity prices higher,
 exports helping that.

 MR. HELLER.
 largely agree staff forecast
 first half 1988, couple doubts bounceback, basis bounce-back, second half.
 review things: government [sector forecast]
 year whole -1.3; consumption slow; residential structures
 flat; business investment 1 1-1/2 percent; export
 growth--which driving engine economy present
 time--is slowing significantly. instance, compare:
 23.8 percent growth third quarter 1987 12.8
 percent growth forecasted third quarter 1988 which,
 all, opening quarter second half bounce-back.
 So, really don't think forces going generate
 
 2/9-10/88

 bounce-back second half place. First all,
 Chairman mentioned already, much forecast based
 drop saving rate--something really don't want see,
 reasons Jerry Corrigan mentioned.
 Second,
 first-quarter first-half slowdown hits, think lot
 businessmen revising forecasts,
 investment decisions, second half. Third, leading
 indicators, although they're reliable, solidly
 last three months.
 And, finally, nobody mentioned-Martha Seger skirting around issue, think--political
 uncertainties.
 Let anyhow. get close election,
 political uncertainties new programs
 discussed--on tax side, federal government spending side,
 general--will also exactly forces lead

 get postponed; that's something experienced

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you, Mr. Kohn.
 
 questions
 
 Mr. Kohn?
 MR. JOHNSON. actually tried project
 aggregates Greenbook forecast--just see looks
 like respect ranges?
 MR. KOHN.
 
 That's exactly did; that's 6
 
 percent--
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Okay, that's ranges come from.
 
 MR. KOHN. front this, take
 Greenbook forecast interest rates implied see
 money growth implied that. there's iterative process
 coming together money [growth] Greenbook forecast.
 But, theory, it's consistent.
 There's effort make
 consistent.
 MR. JOHNSON. Looking forecast, sort Ushape interest rates you'd think you'd get almost mirror
 image aggregates.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Well, problem--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. almost looks like nonlinear target
 accommodate that-MR. KOHN. one's talking targeting aggregates,
 think--quarter-by-quarter, case.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 True.
 
 MR. KOHN. situation see money
 growth relatively strong velocity falling first part
 year decline rates.
 It's much first

 given lags process, what's left October 20th
 on, terms interest rates, would affect M2 growth, particularly
 first half 1988.
 increase
 interest rates forecast second half 1988 would
 impact M2 second half 1988, though it's mostly
 crystallized impact 1989.
 whole movement
 opportunity costs isn't large, given lags over, say,
 second half 1987 second half 1988 to-MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. PARRY.

 Absolutely; yes.

 questions behind us.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 one.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Well, let's first make sure
 
 Go ahead.
 
 regard width band,
 
 uncertainty, honest way present that--if remember
 Stat 101--is band uncertainty identified.
 really think cannot target within 3 percentage point
 ranges, think would honest bump range point
 bottom exceed top, could
 explain indicative uncertainty rather sort
 policy message.
 MR. KOHN. guess question Committee would
 answer whether uncertainty greater
 last 12 13 years ranges given. They've
 three points almost uniformly throughout period.
 arguing regard interest sensitivity, one source
 uncertainty don't know what's going happen real
 economy, interest rates going move, money
 growth consistent want happen.
 perspective, think probably little uncertainty
 was, say, '70s early '80s. perhaps
 realize degree uncertainty. experiments suggest
 interest elasticity M2 little higher 5, 6, 7
 years ago.
 MS. SEGER. Well, starting 1984, seems
 people either suffering undershoot--or rather, two
 years overshoot followed last year's undershoot. Now, that's
 going back '70s; certainly, given recent history,
 occurs maybe would get less trouble financial
 market participants put front.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Anybody else questions?
 
 MR. PARRY. Yes, one more. Part answer Governor
 Johnson's question fact also pattern income
 well; since opposite signs, effect, takes
 little pattern--

 midpoint 6 percent M2 M3. That, turn, implies 0

 leaves Committee flexibility year. think
 gives us latitude respond velocity 0.
 again, think also added cosmetic value good
 grist testimony. So, I'm alternative III.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Well, think monetary growth targets
 important, would like even law didn't
 require them. conditions exist occur year
 unforeseen may warrant time time accepting
 growth outside target ranges. think advantage
 targets do, sense, hold us accountable
 deviations--that is, whenever faster growth targets,
 turns policy mistake, seems bear
 responsibility. isn't question
 somewhat line right M2 grown outside target
 ranges. year-over-year growth rate bottomed M2 3

 seems important, go

 couldn't keep rate inflation long-run desired level

 seems

 miss two years row, plan miss two years row,
 downside becomes somewhat unacceptable. is,
 
 experience year certain commodity price pressures
 exchange rate pressures conditions financial markets caused us
 believe week-to-week basis monetary policy needed
 eased order achieve growth rate targets. think
 ought say second year: bottom
 target range go with, really mean
 expect ease go it? bottom 5 percent,
 frankly, high feel comfortable pledging would
 want ease 4-1/2--even though financial markets might
 somewhat adjustment problem, exchange markets might
 problem, inflationary fears might there. guess don't want
 put position pledging ease
 condition. So, would prefer alternative III. Frankly, many
 colleagues know, I've flirting somewhat even 4 7
 percent proper range. believe
 uncertain conditions side might helpful
 somewhat higher boundary. would join Vice Chairman
 willing go alternative III.
 Now, playing around year-end
 adjustment problem. time-to-time concerned
 seasonal adjustments year-end give us last-quarter base
 seems somewhat kilter. think long-run policy
 would happier basing last 6 months year
 beginning cone October 1 rather basing fourth
 quarter beginning cone November 15th. would
 subtle tendency, course, cause cone wider,
 year's end extra width would $11 billion. would
 still give us narrower 3 percentage point range
 talked about. I've kind flirted [the view that] maybe 4 8
 percent ought right, would give us 6 percent
 midpoint; anything gives us move direction
 could go with. So, guess I'll summarize saying alternative III.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. could go along alternative III well,
 problem really path, Governor
 Angell already started address. First all, think
 clear last year, Governor Angell pointed out, consistently
 undershot short-term targets. undershot various targets
 established 1 percent lowest undershoot 3.9
 percent maximum undershoot. think it's important
 don't year, getting danger
 zone downside. So, hope draw bottom half
 
 -34-
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 target cone--the lower band--with thick pencil
 intention go bottom side.
 far base concerned, think
 special factors end year, different
 special factors end last year.
 think
 reasons detailed Bluebook, exhaustive detail,
 compelling indeed.
 lot sympathy Governor
 Angell saying changing base period around somewhat.

 particular, look chart M2, instance, see
 proposed parallel bands 1988 upper limits
 exact continuation bottom part last year.
 we're saying
 lowering permanently one reason only-and that's accident January 1st happens.
 two-year
 targets, would position would say, "Well,
 awful lot catching do."
 [target] year
 begun midyear, would started out, let's say, June-that's time point argument better--then
 would bottom end cone would probably
 arguing moving towards middle cone.
 ratify permanently temporary factors effect
 end last year, think, would mistake. would
 support new target ranges proviso rebasing.
 rebase, think two options open us.
 One would go bottom end last year's target cone-that's roughly solid line dashed line intersect
 graph--and start year's target cone there. So, would
 working area overlap instead zero overlap
 last year year. alternative--one may
 compromise Governor Angell suggesting--is base towards
 second half 1987, taking midpoint there. Eyeballing it,
 see getting bit overlap least, instead
 virtually zero overlap.
 So, rebasing proposal along one
 line, I'd happy go along.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, let say outset
 think course policy moment--of using discretionary
 policy rather slavish adherence aggregates
 intermediate target--is quite appropriate. don't
 particularly worry greatly miss targets given year
 circumstance requiring miss evident us.

 hand, required law, know, set
 targets. think need set realistically possible
 avoid, can, shortfall overshoot M2 M3.
 said yesterday thought risks economy
 downside, believe that. think it's
 very, delicate balance. suggested earlier, think
 also risks upside economy.
 I'm prepared
 believe staff's forecast, places nominal GNP 5-1/2
 percent.
 suggests midpoint range
 somewhat lower 5 8 percent set July, even
 little lower suggested Bluebook alternative III.
 So, would like propose wider band--recognizing
 traditional perhaps doesn't precedent. would think
 
 -35-
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 range 4 8 percent would appropriate, given
 interest rate elasticity M2. think kind range
 would give us flexibility adjust policy year goes
 along measure risks really lie. moment,
 seems hardly room 5 8 percent
 shortfall M2 growth. reason would drop
 whole range think that, people would tend think
 tightening policy. gotten away
 monetary aggregates extent, think climate
 year perhaps attention going paid set
 M2 M3. think testimony going take even
 importance usually does.
 wouldn't like give
 implication tightening, keeping 8 percent top,
 think might avoid least mitigate suggestion
 tightening. Now, 4-1/2 7 percent would acceptable me,
 preference would 4 8 percent, recognizing risks
 wider range Kohn already indicated.
 don't know want talk M3, would like
 keep range 5 8 percent think this, too, would
 damp implication tightening. Or, adopted 4
 8 percent M2 5 8 percent M3, implication
 tightening based lower M2 range would damped kept M3
 So, summary, targeting nominal GNP using
 5 8 percent.
 6 midpoint 4 8 percent range M2, think,
 would give us kind flexibility need downside, without
 would prefer
 giving implication tightening market.
 4 8 percent range M2 5 8 percent M3.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, would go alternative III,

 alternative III alternative II.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would also favor alternative III.
 think conveys right message financial markets. One thing
 might consider range M3 slightly [unintelligible]; elasticities probably get
 stronger growth M3 M2. regard base question,
 would opposed suggestions Governors Angell Heller
 instead would prefer Kohn cone.

 Two different ways.

 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. However may decide tilt policy short

 yesterday; words, think that's achieve maximum
 sustainable growth employment output. current setting,
 I'd like achieve certain continuity policy

 that's occurring economy discussed--or least
 take steps retard adjustment trying bolster domestic

 think works direction price stability goes

 MR. JOHNSON. Gary, assuming stable demand

 MR. STERN. I'm assuming don't know less today

 MR. JOHNSON. you're saying uncertainty

 MR. STERN. Yes, that's right. think might argue,
 although I'm press it, last year's shortfall
 history can't anything it. I'm sure want
 much acceleration that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 far is.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. would favor 4 8 percent alternative;
 I'd go alternative II would widen M2 4 8 percent.
 think half point reduction already
 preliminary numbers sends right long-term signal. think
 reduction would, sense, almost confusing. People
 perceive thrust policy opposite direction
 think would potentially destabilizing signal. think
 everybody knows comments long period time I've
 felt strongly Jerry others long-run
 inflationary risks, think might confusing. think
 4 percent lower band M2 recognizes Jerry's concern; actually
 gives us latitude move direction
 alternative III would to. don't think widening
 ranges 3 percentage points 4 percentage points really
 problem. don't think anybody perceives us targeting monetary
 aggregates anyway; certainly don't. take economic forecast
 pick [monetary growth] numbers think roughly
 consistent; don't work out, fine. So, don't think
 violates anything terms perceive we're
 think outside world thinks we're doing. So, that's
 come out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, think us agree basic
 policy challenge balance short-run risks
 weakness long-run risks inflation need keep
 external adjustment process moving forward. Given looseness
 aggregates way treated aggregates last
 several years, substantively, don't think makes lot
 difference whether alternative I, II, III, far trying
 play balancing game. seems

 2/9-10/88
 
 -38-
 
 think message important; would like send
 balanced message. would like country know
 concerned current weakness also want underscore
 longer-term concerns. think alternative II sends
 balanced message. tended loosen little, done
 short run last couple weeks, send message
 tightening alternative III, think that's
 confusing message. think you're sending messages,
 want keep messages simple possible. time,
 reverted alternative I, think sends wrong message
 too. So, would think testimony want strike
 balance, me, alternative II sends message.

 totally intellectually honest, think we'd

 take longer-term perspective M2, rebased last
 two years, would now. words,

 terms rebasing issue, it's old one come
 many times terms base drift. least eight years ago

 seemed somewhat random; days, seemed
 biased one direction. think going want adjust

 would mean something like picking midpoint target range
 every year starting base again--starting cone
 midpoint regardless came out. I'm recommending
 that. guess I'd soon go randomness misses
 start scratch time. would move base
 around. last point would concur Jerry ought
 put M1 monitoring range; but--and may premature
 later discussion--I'd also toss monetary base
 monitoring range.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Without going back yesterday's conversation,
 seem it's important remember economic
 record past years, certainly includes last
 year, pretty good. think outlook year
 also positive. terms risks, they're equal
 upside downside. think good shot
 coming forecast. risks, see
 suggested yesterday, really inflationary front;
 sense buildup inflationary pressure. addressing
 aggregates question, think it's important bear mind.
 Now, despite Don's articulate and, think, clear
 explanation opportunities year regard
 aggregates, think continuing period reasonable
 uncertainty it's terribly difficult forecast
 going come out. Therefore, think ought try establish
 ranges deal tough uncertainties.
 choose one specific alternatives, would choose alternative
 III, largely reasons already said. must
 say, given uncertainty, I'd preference 4 8
 percent range Bob Forrestal suggested. think provide
 uncertainties also deals consistency
 message trying achieve price stability. So, I'd
 preference 4 8 percent certainly could persuaded
 accept alternative III.
 would establish monitoring range
 Ml; think uncertainty still high that.
 would favor rebasing either. think begin move
 base around suit requirements, that's rather awkward
 message; I'd favor rebasing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. guess, like couple
 others sat around table long, I'm maybe getting
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 -40-
 
 jaded. Let first say setting ranges legally necessary
 constraining effect Committee monetary policy.
 Therefore, accept something good.
 listening
 discussion around table brings mind believe
 statement Bluebook: staff forecast falls one
 three [alternatives].
 You're talking difference 1/2
 percentage point midpoint one other. it's
 minutia. fact matter one fit.
 So, think Ed Boehne right. Bard said, "all
 world's stage" think that's we're today.
 is, [the issue] kind message give testify
 regarding intention Federal Reserve period ahead
 respect economic growth inflation. view
 since already established alternative II July, probably don't
 know much what's ahead July respect
 decision aggregate ranges.
 Going holiday Jerry
 suggested, least Federal Reserve nothing
 dramatic, seems good thing happen period
 ahead. would reestablish ranges alternative II; think
 anything want them. think serve
 purpose; message give testimony
 important one.
 would rebase; we've many, many times
 past great deal consternation Congress others
 thought rebasing. don't think ought
 get kind controversy. result, could accept
 widening range 4 8 percent; avoid ripples I'd
 5 8 percent--alternative II straight line.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman speech made
 basically Roger others.
 would favor alternative II--not
 substance appearance it--and hope make best
 translation substance. reflect march down--maybe
 pace would argue for--but it's half point less
 1987, it's consistent direction
 reducing ranges, least.
 go alternative III, Tom
 Melzer said, wonder that's bit conflicting signal
 versus generally perceived doing, might lead
 confusion. Alternative II permits us, think, whatever
 need do. would reflect, least,
 continuing commitment guarding inflation. So, would stay
 put tentatively. would rebase either.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. impressed
 Gary Stern said ago: whatever tilt may make
 short run--and we'll discuss little later--it's important
 keep eye inflation longer run. think
 that's message want project.
 case,
 comfortable alternative III.
 would like see us
 maintain much discipline hold feet fire
 stay within whatever ranges set.
 course,
 capability going outside ranges that's appropriate.
 
 -41-
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 Part reasoning would like see us stay within
 whatever ranges set and, we're going make serious effort
 that, like idea little lower side
 4-1/2 percent low instead 5 percent low.
 Apparently argument rebasing around
 while--it's new new sort consideration--but
 must say makes lot sense me. don't know formal
 work done issue years past, would urge
 least review seriously consider it. I'd little
 leery ad hoc right table without
 consideration, impressed force argument,
 I'd like see pursued little. would agree
 fought battle getting away trying forced
 projecting M1; don't think still
 much variability go back it. So,
 sum would go alternative number III.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. don't feel strongly
 particular ranges. feel little like Roger Guffey others
 spoken issue. However, think signal issues,
 credibility points, made. think, we're going
 credible view long-term inflation picture,
 midpoint whatever range establish
 M2--I say M2 prefer setting monitoring range M1,
 given view many problems--we demonstrate
 moving towards price stability, nominal GNP that's
 consistent price stability. favor continually
 ratcheting midpoint. seems fact
 even establish range means trying embody
 uncertainties, terms things affect
 aggregate; otherwise, we'd line. ranges
 somewhat credible encompass think
 uncertainties. fall outside ranges, means
 weren't even certain uncertainties. creates
 problems. personal view encompass
 uncertainties range that's wider
 here. think gives us political credibility problem,
 extent, presentation. I'm really narrow
 range, even though don't think embodies uncertainties
 could face. would look kind silly announcing range
 admitted uncertainty think really faced with.
 guess don't really mind whether alternative II
 guess
 alternative III; I'm sort indifferent [between two].
 going honest myself, alternative II would
 little better; allows wider range ratchets middle
 last year. I'm comfortable alternative III; wouldn't
 resist that.
 basing issue, implications
 base. think Governor Heller Governor Angell made important
 points. think handled language
 testimony present this. don't handle carefully,
 could give message short-term implication
 target range setting tightening policy. could conflict
 might trying short run create
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 -42-
 
 confusion. So, seems we're going go
 alternative III, careful explain
 Chairman testifies this, could
 
 confusion we're actually short term
 target might imply. think basing issue important.
 think Governors Heller Angell pointed could
 take care concerns rebasing.
 think could
 also take care concerns right kind language
 presentation. don't really strong preference
 

 
 either, long take care it. think probably it's better
 handle language rather try explain
 rebasing--although sentiment maybe trying normalize
 last two months fourth quarter, November December,
 none us explain well, building base
 normalized trend pattern fourth quarter rather
 letting last two months affect average. don't feel

 MS. SEGER. Last July dissented proposal made

 we'd get crack now, could appropriate

 go and, consequently, willing go cut now,
 what's called alternative II, believe. would like go
 wider band, keeping said Kohn
 uncertainties. think misleading people
 suggest get within 3-point range. thought
 could, that's one thing; least many times can't.
 So, would go along Messrs. Forrestal Melzer:
 alternative II, maybe 4 8 percent range M2 staying
 5 8 percent M3, phase in. still believe
 risk downside. Also, think people
 real world think downside risks [this
 Committee] ought really, really concerned anything

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One thing meeting
 think pretty important find mechanism
 perceived general consensus. reason say
 it's fairly obvious Administration beginning

 people minding store. one thing would
 particularly like, could find way time,
 find way accommodate manner
 speak single voice. don't know whether that's
 going feasible, listening I've hearing. it's
 certainly problem one dealing concurrently issues

 mind, look particular outlook, sort

 inventory weakness, inventory recession, there. reason,
 essentially, actually meaningful inventory overhang,
 we'd already see order books. strikes

 concurrently notion inventory overhang. Every
 inventory recession I've ever experienced--and I've seen awful
 lot them--was signaled first order books anything
 else. tells me, least, whatever problems
 there, that's one them. However, must say pretty much
 agree Jerry Corrigan saying--namely,
 problem there, it's financial area. must say
 I'm bothered this. major shock October

 sense think markets need time healing--meaning
 need general softness short end money market.
 it's fairly apparent also, general views around table
 correct longer term--and must say, subscribe pretty
 much everyone saying fears inflation--that
 make certain that, choose little

 So, said that, guess could take break

 MR. KOHN. I'd make couple points that. One
 drop private short-term rates, particularly since last FOMC

 monetary policy expectations anything like that.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 going back, though, October--
 
 MR. KOHN. think decline bond yields
 reflect weaker outlook economy expectations
 interest rates rising much people previously thought

 something upward slope beyond that. get
 little, slope upward bit; think reflects

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. mean they're, giving slightly
 different signals. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. May come back, Don, one second Bob
 Black's question alternative B means? page 13
 indeed say it's associated borrowing $250 million.
 page 14, paragraph 16, says "Alternative B contemplates
 continuation reserve conditions expected prevail
 recent slight easing." Now, get [the directive]
 language, we're going look minute, says
 alternative B "would maintain existing degree pressure
 reserve positions." guess would like know would
 defined. Would defined $250 million would
 defined what, fact, happening recent days,
 like $150 million $200 million?
 MR. KOHN. Peter give views also, guess would
 still tempted think $250 million center
 gravity kind funds rate range. would also ready
 adjust informally, Mr. Sternlight done
 intermeeting period, looked like inconsistent
 Committee's expectations. think one week, even two weeks, low
 borrowing necessarily indicative whole thing

 carefully. So, started writing $250 million,
 persistently came consistent funds trading

 adjustment. I'm sure would right off.
 MR. KELLEY. Then, say going
 maintain existing degree pressure, wouldn't necessarily
 mean going to, fact, tighten

 MR. BOYKIN. Don, read write-up, alternative would

 would alternative B accommodate discount rate reduction?
 MR. KOHN. Well, would depend combination.
 Alternative B implies funds trading 6-1/2 6-3/4 percent area,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 questions?
 
 not, let's go
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, analysis
 Greenbook suggest policy eased beyond
 actions taken two weeks ago. sharp slowdown half
 year related inventory buildup corrected
 midyear. rate decline wouldn't much effect
 correction, actually would primarily impact second half
 year economy really expected bounce back.
 Moreover, accepted much smaller inventory pattern
 staff's forecast statement guess made yesterday
 inventory correction could even less expected
 Board's staff, would seem easing
 point could something mistake. Also-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Unless you're using something
 
 else.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Excuse me?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Unless you're using insurance.
 
 MR. PARRY. Perhaps. Also, growth rate 2 percent
 slightly higher 1988 whole acceptable, view, given
 rapid growth economy last year also given
 economy entered range full employment. Therefore, I'd
 favor alternative B. course, greater weakness begin show
 
 -55-
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 statistics, could always make change toward easier
 policy next regular meeting.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Maybe not.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 borrowing assumption?
 
 number indicate?
 MR. PARRY.
 
 $250 million.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 $250 million.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Let ask: concentrating
 short-term issue going try combine whole thing
 point comments?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, that's good question. Bob,
 would reiterate context longer-run targets well?
 MR. PARRY. Right. favor alternative B
 short term; long term, 4-1/2 7-1/2 percent,
 is, think, alternative III.
 MR. JOHNSON. view careful
 terms short-term direction policy. It's clear me,
 come back BIS meeting, international situation
 would sensitive [want to] trigger discount rate reduction.
 think there's much larger international implication move
 like that--not say forces might require move
 might develop next weeks, things looked
 serious anticipate. think serious economic
 conditions international community could probably absorb something
 like that. right certainly don't enough information,
 think, imply that. think also sensitive
 international situation consider short-term course
 policy.
 So, views, terms open market operations short
 run, don't imply move discount rate unless future
 developments point towards weakening. say that,
 still think slight tone easing necessary. think
 done without creating expectation discount rate
 reduction, mainly think markets perceive
 sensitive international situation
 sensitive dollar. matter fact, I've already seen
 number reports indicating Fed would likely
 trigger discount rate reduction international
 considerations. think that's sort right tone
 market. time, seems market already
 absorbed quite well--as Chairman others pointed out--some
 expectations modest easing. they've actually absorbed
 totally clear yet, there's still bit uncertainty
 are.
 guess preference somewhere "B"
 "A", although closer "B". I'm thinking would prefer
 something centered around policy consistent 6-1/2 percent
 funds rate, maybe even hint lower that. Alternative B
 
 -56-
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 associated $250 million borrowing; guess could accept $200
 million borrowing something consistent view, although
 I'm confident borrowing number projecting
 want.
 could accept $200 million number, given
 described open market operations Bluebook somewhat sensitive
 borrowing number money market conditions,
 seems appropriate me. So, guess that's come
 short run--trying avoid implication discount rate
 reduction, although may totally possible that. Given
 move like I'm suggesting, slight move away
 already are, I'm even sure markets would know
 difference already I'm suggesting,
 things haven't totally settled. would go something like
 $200 million borrowing number, tad described
 "B", kind language operations implied
 Bluebook.
 terms long run, said, really don't much
 preference alternative II alternative III, mainly
 they're centered point.

 alternative II slightly wider range associated it,
 little consistent view uncertainties terms
 M2 target.
 guess somebody else mentioned 4 8 percent
 instead 5 8 percent, alternative II, gets
 even closer think right answer. guess
 preference would something like 4 8 percent M2 target range
 $200 million borrowing number. think somehow
 satisfies concerns short term long term.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. would prefer alternative B short run,
 $250 million borrowings target. Basically, feeling
 clearly significant change thrust policy,
 matter want look it.
 Interest rates, terms fed
 funds, 100 basis points late
 September-early October. dramatic shift shows through,
 month anyway, growth reserves monetary base.
 would say, let's let work. don't think easing
 called stage. Secondly, guess perhaps
 importantly, already decided make move back normal
 applications borrowings target think, Governor Angell
 suggested, ought take advantage stable conditions
 complete move now.
 understand Peter said need
 sensitive short run--letting policy change show
 through--and think appropriate. think move
 back ought get done. really think markets
 become quite accustomed dealing that, fluctuations
 got funds rate tended last day two-week
 statement period.
 don't think that's problem terms
 conditions.
 would move back now.
 would indicate
 directive that--I wouldn't language
 terms continued flexibility. agreement
 that, might even deal lead-in phrase
 "taking account conditions financial markets" line 108.

 thing would directive is, lead-in think
 we'd say maintain--or whatever we're going do-maintain/increase/decrease "the degree pressure sought recent

 MR. JOHNSON. ask question said

 want ask Peter:
 understanding last weeks
 borrowing averaging $150 million; think
 implication you're saying continuation trend
 definitely implies much higher funds rate, even current

 don't know want clarify that.
 MR. MELZER.
 
 Well, I'm sure necessarily agree
 
 that.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, borrowing $150

 MR. MELZER.

 saying spike billion two billion borrowing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, Tom, I'm raising
 point kicking back forth,
 persistently under--implying there's still disinclination
 move discount window--a certain historic relationship
 funds rate/discount rate relationship. That's I'm saying. I'm
 making statistical point; you're raising operational question.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, may right.
 may mean
 big spike settlement date, Wednesday. still implies
 significant funds rate spike around settlement day;

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. I'm generally favor alternative B, one
 slight modification I'll get moment. think,
 several people mentioned, work little harder
 have, least, achieving borrowing objective--however
 specify it. light that, light I've seen going
 markets lately relationship funds
 rate/discount rate spread borrowings, think would favor
 borrowing target probably neighborhood $200 million rather

 think lot history suggest can. So, don't
 share Jerry's concern calling spade spade.
 Therefore, recommended policy would alternative B,
 mean keep federal funds rate around 6-5/8

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think seems
 general consensus willingness accept 4 8 percent M2

 clear exactly everyone comes M3.
 Don,
 recommendation that?
 MR. KOHN. Well, thought matter could
 retain 5 8 percent M3 range. projecting growth around
 6-1/2 percent, so-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 You're talking M3?
 
 MR. KOHN. M3, right.
 So, 5 8 percent would encompass
 that, 4-1/2 7-1/2 percent also close. think President
 Parry others mentioned, occasion past-though last several years--had M3 ranges
 slightly higher M2 ranges.
 So, it's without precedence.
 MR. PARRY.
 one question that.
 4

 want make distinction two terms uncertainties.
 4 8 percent fine; like midpoint 6
