 me.
 mr. sternlight.
 
 think concern
 
 longer-ms. seger.
 
 expect special factor or--
 
 mr. sternlight. think longer-term matter judgment

 insofar particular project concern, there's

 end exactli amount addit inflat
 next year. import thing, think, staff's
 analysi assumpt need tighten
 action order bring result thei're project.
 analysi conduct bank reach sort
 conclus. guess there's go error, would
 come jerri corrigan rest did:
 board staff's forecast--and well--might actual
 forecast less inflat we're apt realli have.
 rate we're go, greenbook show smooth
 transit expans driven domest demand toward on
 driven foreign demand. except brief upsw third
 quarter, rate growth gross privat domest purchas
 expect slow significantli result weaken
 consum demand busi fix invest. and, cours, that's
 perfectli plausibl scenario, would excel on
 work out. but, i'm sure everyon would agre, it's
 far safe bet. guess would conclud busi fix
 invest particular, given high level capac
 util, apt somewhat stronger we're think. so,
 short, think greenbook forecast reason
 defens, that's probabl best could hope for;
 fear we're go well inflat
