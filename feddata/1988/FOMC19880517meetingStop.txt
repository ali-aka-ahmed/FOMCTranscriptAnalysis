 May 17, 1988
 [Secretary's note: transcript exists first part
 meeting, included staff reports discussion
 economic outlook. texts staff reports contained
 
 Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. little problem
 Brazilian negotiations, diverted Jerry Corrigan short
 while.
 He'll back, asks us get started event.
 listening rather closely discussion had,
 strikes fairly general uniformity views
 happening economy.
 think Governor Heller's view
 looking elimination negatives
 distinct accumulation positives exactly right.
 one
 thing little careful recognize
 point, whenever get situation uniformly
 positive this, turns.
 It's question turns.
 thing that's bothering slightly outlook look
 it--not negative sense confirmation sense--is that,
 particular stage cycle, running type
 acceleration inflationary process forefront
 
 concerns, think begin get significant
 inventory accumulation. forces place it:
 namely, intermediate prices beginning move general awareness
 aggregate demand. Yet seeing either;
 acceleration types commodity prices tend
 reflective imbalance supply demand.
 I'm arguing
 commodity price explanation inflation side--where Governor
 Angell coming from--but yet secondary followthrough metals prices prices, since
 stabilized, indicator inflation but, think,
 indicator fact thing yet accumulating.
 guess probably will, don't think evidence
 yet has. data lead times, higher,
 don't yet suggest type tightness see lot
 individual industries. process fear going
 create fairly substantial acceleration time, isn't
 moment--or least hasn't. I'd curious--for
 specific insights this, would appreciate
 addressing issue specifically, would,
 monetary discussion.
 don't think question
 next move make upside.
 question, basically, whether
 next FOMC meeting basis certain contingencies.
 thing
 feel little uncomfortable answer question:
 weren't meeting today, particular date, would moving
 would waiting couple weeks so?
 reason raise
 question market expectation extrapolates
 do.
 words, start move sharply,
 expectation jumps quickly.
 I'm little concerned
 move fast, get significantly ahead curve,
 said. stock market think
 could get pretty shabby. could get confidence reversed.
 So, come moment basically either:
 alternative B asymmetrical language toward tightening,
 
 5/17/88
 
 fairly explicit expectation appropriate point would
 move up; going $100 million borrowing, also
 asymmetrical language, think question really gets
 issue whether go $100 million $200 million next
 FOMC meeting. preference would "B" asymmetrical
 language implying almost certainly moving sometime
 intermeeting period. don't think particular
 dangers raise borrowing $100 million now. Frankly,
 think going $200 million now, top done already,
 getting edge little risky rapidity
 movement implicit extent market
 extrapolations occur consequence. Governor Johnson.
 MR. JOHNSON. I'm sort following left
 tail end last discussion. I'd like throw hat
 ring concur Chairman said. came
 meeting, guess feeling even little moderate
 that; although generally tend be--. walked last
 meeting change discussion convinced
 needed move. time, came meeting basically feeling
 voted $100 million increase borrowing
 average last FOMC meeting made another $100 million
 increase borrowing average, occurred.
 markets really absorbed move, think. would
 unusual, probably little risky, immediately hit market
 meeting another $100 million more,
 something like alternative C, market absorbed--and
 think favorably absorbed--our last move. So, guess
 prepared come something like change, asymmetric
 language provides flexibility move toward tighter policy
 maybe another $100 million increase borrowing average
 next intermeeting period, think would probably likely.
 important issue would timing. still tend favor
 approach, although guess could actually support $100 million
 move now. still think would important
 discretion timing filtering market rather
 moving immediately meeting since we've absorbed
 $100 million move borrowing. would strongly going
 alternative C couple reasons. One, think would
 shock markets; prepared absorb that,
 think would even wonder they're missing know.
 think better information, don't see kind evidence
 supports kind move. Secondly, think would raise
 immediately markets anticipation imminent discount
 rate move. Going $200 million borrowing point-taking borrowings $600 million average, would take
 funds rate probably range 7-1/2 percent plus, maybe
 7-3/4 percent--would immediately raise expectations move
 discount rate. That's something would like avoid. I'm
 ultimately moving discount rate to,
 think discount rate ought used mainly extra piece
 ammunition, important symbol even serious situation,
 arises. would prefer simply technical
 adjustment already taken place markets.
 lose effectiveness might want discount
 rate move later. So, would prefer create expectations
 imminent move market. leeway still,
 think cautious.
 
 5/17/88
 
 preference, again, would change,
 asymmetric language understanding probably would
 imminent move timed sometime within next intermeeting period.
 I'd leave Chairman Desk determine that.
 $100 million move would reasonable, would still prefer
 Desk remain sensitive filtered
 markets, given fact they've absorbed $100 million
 increase borrowings last days.
 don't know exactly
 puts terms "A", "B", "C"; maybe say
 it's probably somewhere around "B".
 Although guess
 preference "B" asymmetric language, could live "B"
 would involve $100 million borrowing move,
 sensitivity Desk's part.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, think 95 percent
 meetings I've attended last 20 years would
 perfectly appropriate make proposal change existing
 policy, light uncertainties existed time.
 think that's one reason we've always tended lag. I'm
 particularly concerned, given present structure meetings.
 went eight-meeting system back time
 supposedly controlling M1 and, therefore, less need
 frequent consultation.
 think ought reconsidered
 really interest rate control system, even though
 lot sentiment expressed last meeting.
 next meeting end June involves long intermeeting
 interval kind situation. doesn't mean disagree
 recommendation sort hedge position here--go
 half way, idea we'll look incoming data
 next couple weeks, perhaps decide go whole hog. would
 suggest proper time would meeting new
 orders figures out.
 thesis right--that head
 steam building manufacturing sector--then ought
 reflected pretty strong orders figures. they're strong,
 would signal for-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. pick purchasing
 managers' survey; it's probably sensitive published
 figures.
 MR. MORRIS.
 you'd pick up.
 
 That's right; wanted wait two weeks
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. get lead times, get
 qualitative sense issue raising.
 MR. MORRIS.
 terms approaching way hedging
 position--moving half way reconsidering couple weeks-that makes good sense me. But, weren't going reconsider,
 would prefer go whole hog right now.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 whole hog mean "C" or--
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 
 Whole hog means "C", yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 5/17/88
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, asked us comment
 specifically inventories. think probably
 indication accumulated inventories imported goods,
 
 that's response higher prices.
 
 regard goods,
 
 recollection period late '70s occurred
 bit lagging factor. usually happens
 get pickup price indexes begins fuel
 
 expectations; don't get really rapid accumulation
 inventories somewhat later.
 
 that, fact, correct,
 
 think maybe waiting indicator might little
 dangerous.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. later; now.
 already this. course, we're May get
 June. haven't seen happening data.
 Historically, would happening now.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 right?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Yes.
 
 Well, thought delay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't think so.
 
 MR. PARRY. case, see developments,
 particularly ones we've mentioned--unemployment, capacity
 utilization, M2, positioning aggregates--it seems
 strong case support Bluebook alternative C.
 fact, can't imagine convincing case put us
 one put us staff. general
 agreement staff's forecast; questioning it.
 seems explicit staff's forecast
 delay taking action, we're going pay price later--conceivably,
 based upon know, terms move even
 aggressively. know mentioned we've moved twice
 recently. two moves 1/4 percentage point don't
 much. remember earlier times when, get significant
 impacts economy, one would move lot
 1/4 point. So, clear recommendation would Bluebook
 alternative C. could see something compromise move
 borrowings maybe $100 million now. would hope
 would specific plans talk reconvene couple weeks
 see intervening two weeks bring terms data,
 think that, unless show weakness, move
 again.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. regard policy, think timing
 question difficult one, suggested. markets-certainly stock market maybe bond market well--probably
 vulnerable move far fast. hand,
 they're vulnerable delay long. don't know
 precise, perfect timing kind action is. think
 longer-term goal point tried make earlier:
 whatever likely happen wage price side,
 doesn't seem there's going deceleration next year
 
 -5-
 
 5/17/88
 
 unless act.
 think time action,
 would favor second alternative, go $100
 million now, asymmetric directive, expect
 probably big shock markets.
 fact, depending
 circumstances, could welcomed. happens
 depends data come in.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, everything we've talked
 morning--the forecast, employment unemployment
 numbers, potential wage price pressures--clearly
 pretty uniformly indicates, think, risk upside
 worried inflation. But, don't interpret
 last two actions took recently unsubstantial.
 So,
 preference would wait take action let
 two actions work way economy.
 all,
 latest action little ago.
 Now, hadn't taken
 actions, I'd different mind. But, moment,
 strong preference wait--perhaps long--maybe three
 four weeks, something like that.
 So, would like stay
 $400 million borrowing, asymmetrical
 directive.
 would prepared support alternative would
 move $100 million, $500 million, symmetrical
 directive. would real problem moving way
 alternative C point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 I'd like start sort recapping
 see worldwide inflation rates.
 think looking
 situation where, one reason another, inflation rates two
 major economies moving toward ours, instead
 moving toward theirs. seems real
 loss ground. reasons that; exceeded
 monetary growth rate targets, partly defense dollar.
 monetary growth rates seem giving kind impetus
 spending economies would expect.
 don't see
 going away time soon.
 So, worldwide,
 potential trend discouraging.
 terms inflation
 rate--just reiterate said earlier--we stalled
 rate think high us, least stated
 terms objective, price stability. Even staff
 forecast error, sense it's strong
 economy, seems we're still faced prospect
 inflation staying current levels rising. objective
 price stability, ought begin pursue objective
 aggressively.
 respect movements, size movements
 policy actions, think several issues surround
 discussion.
 One credibility policy. Policy credibility
 means markets believe you're going say you'll do.
 find difficult believe markets believe rhetoric
 price stability long bond rate 9 percent.
 don't
 know happened morning, suspect
 advising people market, year ago, I'd say
 economy looks stronger thought, would see
 
 5/17/88
 
 rise inflation and, therefore, rise interest rates.
 would expect bond market selling off. Back
 credibility issue: move now, convincingly, seems
 peak interest rates lower
 wait go forward incremental steps. second point
 credibility issue confusion public and, perhaps,
 minds. react small moves noisy data come
 monthly, think public doesn't understand fully
 we're trying do. importantly, think convinces us
 ability control economic activity really do.
 think monetary policy long-run policy, short-run policy.
 So, think markets unsure us. gained
 credibility; think ought retain credibility.
 last, guess ought say, given strength statement,
 
 prefer alternative D.
 
 think I'll end there.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'll record "C" don't
 [unintelligible] end! President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 think balance notion
 go, think tightening, without
 
 disruptive markets.
 
 best balancing, point view,
 
 would raise borrowing $100 million now. say now, don't
 mean tomorrow; would think would give Desk
 would
 discretion work next week 10 days.
 
 asymmetrical directive would stack deck
 direction tightening, still wait see incoming information.
 
 guess puts kind "B", "C+", asymmetric
 directive.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. I'd like get back middle target
 range monetary aggregates--not instantly, gradually.
 fully agree Chairman's views: alternative B asymmetric
 language $100 million borrowing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 mean $100 million point
 
 between--
 
 MR. HELLER.
 
 point--you feed slowly.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, would join
 concern upward interest rate movement. However, seems
 risk upside, there's enough room take
 another cut restraint without disrupting markets.
 result, would like associate would opt B-C
 alternative, $500 million borrowing; I'd also
 include asymmetrical language toward restraint.
 focus moving $400 million $500 million, would
 note seasonal credit taken normal track increased
 rather dramatically since last meeting something less
 $100 million to--I don't know close period,
 times $200 million. $400 million
 objective borrowing, $200 million seasonal,
 really depending upon view seasonal--whether it's
 
 5/17/88
 
 sensitive interest rate levels not. really believe
 moving $500 million rather promptly major move, given
 makeup borrowing level $500 million. result, going
 $500 million then, asymmetrical language, would permit us move
 toward C alternative depending upon incoming information
 may two weeks. would prescription.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. think question asked
 want wait is: waiting see? think
 good question. I'm sympathetic notion give
 misleading signals regard appears
 focusing make move. seem
 staff forecast accurate, point time discount rate
 change would part move. point
 take place, course, could take place point
 time Open Market Committee meetings. factors
 would make us think would need much change,
 seems ought rule out. So, don't see today
 necessarily time move. would strong preference
 kind signals use. happen like something
 alternative C very, well. like alternative C
 M2 growth paths. Frankly, would like us look
 carefully, and, thought could wait, nothing
 regard borrowing target move. would acceptable
 don't think know stage happened
 money growth would anticipated moves made.
 Certainly, April month knew wasn't going give us
 clear readings monetary aggregates; May looks like might
 consistent "C"; June doesn't follow path, frankly,
 I'd like factor would cause us make
 move. say keeping view able
 achieve movement price level stability allow
 exchange value dollar fall further. believe
 alternative C growth path monetary aggregates would
 consistent stable dollar short-term horizon, I'd
 like kind restraint. certainly feel comfortable
 Chairman--he shown already responsive
 forces could make move see
 alternatives. So, it's okay strong tilt
 directive change today borrowing target,
 provided assurance ready act
 monetary growth rates return thought
 good path 1987. Hindsight says wasn't bad.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, feel little ambivalent,
 certainly regarding direction, regarding question
 timing. talked lot. Ed Boehne phrased much
 way would. would move borrowing today,
 think would pretty quick last move might perhaps
 signal little markets would intend. want
 orderly way. So, would bring level $100
 million soon think markets accommodate that; don't
 know whether that's week two weeks, something like that.
 Certainly, I'd favor asymmetric language upward bias
 
 5/17/88
 
 policy directive. think it's possible,
 likely, move second $100 million next
 meeting Committee. Whether conference call
 leave entirely you, I'm indifferent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. I'm favor "B", including idea adding
 $100 million borrowing target eventually, many
 reasons Chairman mentioned. main reason is, again,
 two tightening moves recent weeks I'm
 I'd
 sure markets fully digested moves.
 surprised real economy taken account
 monetary aggregates begun reflect them. Also,
 mentioned before, think ought pay attention stock
 think lot nervousness still there, least
 market.
 many cases, institutions small
 among lot institutions.
 investors taken walk. haven't heard anyone mention
 thrift industry, think that's disaster area,
 Bob Boykin, I'm sure,
 something pay attention to.
 speak that, number us; much tightening
 can't imagine
 soon, think, would make greater disaster.
 LDC debt situation would improve dramatically tighten
 much. Also, read table growth monetary
 aggregates, seems aggregates expected slow
 still think inventory
 whether go "B" "C".
 don't know be--I'm
 correction cards.
 smart; think excess going
 worked off. fact, interest rates get higher, gives

 business people stronger incentive run less inventory.
 think
 could live asymmetric language well.
 summarizes it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think staff made
 It's true
 excellent case forecast early move.
 made couple moves recently, think timely
 appropriate. remember many times sitting around
 table apparent stage business cycle
 think ought
 traditionally made largest mistakes.
 move now. think you've given us wise counsel suggesting
 hold $100 million increase borrowed reserve figure;
 would buy that, asymmetric directive. I'd like get rid
 think that's unduly
 language unusual flexibility.
 fuzzy confuses people. I'd like keep open option
 would go $100 million if, two three weeks,
 short, "B".
 looks need to.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, Bob Forrestal spoke
 minutes ago wish next one list
 think it's time wait,
 could simply said "me too."
 given evidence date two recent moves, agree
 would favor "B" keeping
 insignificant.
 borrowing now, asymmetrical language. But, Bob
 
 5/17/88
 
 suggested, I'd comfortable going additional $100 million
 symmetrical language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. agree position stated
 I'm "B-", "C+", however
 you, Mr. Chairman, others.
 guess
 characterize it, $100 million increase borrowing.
 would inclined move sooner rather later $100
 million.
 real courage convictions, Lee Hoskins
 does, would really like line him. guess don't
 much courage, given situation
 Southwest. But, think makes very, good point policy,
 do, viewed longer run.
 think temporize rationalize short-run
 problems think would result taking actions, that's really
 communicated tends compound problems longer range.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, instincts probably
 same, think financial market reasons, nothing else,
 I'd willing sneak it. me, would mean $100
 million asymmetric language, although could live
 arrangement Peter flexibility terms
 But, certainly, feel strongly
 edging $100 million in.
 get first $100 million promptly. think
 two changes policy made last several
 weeks clearly viewed favorably markets
 indication indeed prepared respond conditions.
 agree Bob Parry that, insofar economy concerned,
 think Kohn
 doubt they've done much anything.
 made point way, earlier on, pointed nominal
 real interest rates--even moves--are precious little
 different year ago. intervening
 year, economy grown rate simply won't work
 prospectively.
 also nagging fear here--I don't know
 staff's views are--that highly mobile money
 capital markets worldwide basis, may take higher
 level interest rates achieve given degree restraint
 real world. case, problems lie ahead,
 especially context Governor Seger's comments thrifts
 lot things, would difficult
 damaging. precisely reason feel
 strongly moving right thing do.
 agree
 comments made Governor Johnson, think coffee break,
 Lee Hoskins minutes ago: we've got avoid fine
 tuning here; broad thrust developments next six
 seven quarters keep mind. that, too, says
 ought move now.
 also agree Governor Johnson
 discount rate question. situation right
 now--where we're upside cycle don't
 worry frictional levels borrowings--I don't see
 kind prejudice discount rate [increase]
 downside, run frictional borrowings
 problem. So, don't see presumption whatsoever,
 least judgment, moved--perhaps even far fullblown "C"--that would create strong bias toward move
 
 5/17/88
 
 -10-
 
 discount rate. Indeed, phase things we're in, like
 Governor Johnson, personally--not final say
 discount rate--would try keep powder dry discount rate
 work market much possible. think
 two things: One, minimizes dangers market disruptions;
 secondly, leaves us stronger position something really
 adverse develops next month two, whatever. summarize,
 Mr. Chairman, would $100 million now, asymmetric
 directive. That's it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. I've followed moves taken,
 sense that, effect, rather small following
 moves. think point we're going step front
 situation everything we've heard today correct.
 that's going take something order alternative C.
 timing issue talked about.
 would guess--and again, Mr.
 Chairman, think right thing moving within
 latitude--that benefit discussion might
 moved full 50 basis points, wouldn't get two
 increments 25 basis points. view think
 get front make strong statement, would favor "C";
 could certainly accept "B" asymmetrical language--$100
 million $100 million later.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. tabulate results, everyone
 believes, best judge, next moves higher.
 thing basically differs whether move move
 short period. would like suggest that, I've
 written correctly heard everybody, seems
 consensus alternative B asymmetrical language, fairly
 strong willingness--desire, put way--to give
 instructions Chairman Desk move next
 period. would interpret mean that, unless see events
 clearly contrary general consensus outlook
 one hears today, it's almost automatic increase.
 strong, think convincing, case made
 not, conditions, allow get behind power
 curve question. would say further--in line
 issue Frank raised frequency meetings--that
 anything moment arise suggests need telephone
 meeting, think should. would substitute come
 grips rescheduling question. don't think there's
 doubt sensitive policy period; think
 close discussion judgments probably going needed
 intervals shorter scheduled FOMC meetings. So, I'd like
 suggest, hope Norm would find appropriate language-I'm sorry, there's one thing forget. Unfortunately, got
 President Black judgment sentence; get
 appraisals leaving sentence dropping out.
 think we'll go around question take vote.

 Sometimes can't read

 wanted state something clearly operational paragraph,

 inflationary pressures, developments foreign exchange markets,
 well behavior monetary aggregates, Committee

 -12-

 restraint would slightly lesser reserve restraint might--and
 you'd clear end tilt--be acceptable later

 I'm sorry, think you're putting the--
 
 MR. KOHN. So, first sentence maintain it;

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Anybody object strongly

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 trouble it.
 
 would rephrase it?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. would first sentence say
 Committee seeks increase slightly degree pressure
 reserves.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 that's majority is.
 
 Majority.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. understand that, asked
 would prefer. That's prefer.
 I'm asking question
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh, okay.
 whether I've captured sense majority.
 MR. HELLER.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Yes, that's good.
 mine.
 
 MR. ANGELL. seems that's appropriate
 response. understand then, almost means
 would expect maybe telephone conference call don't it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, would say expect;
 don't, would require one.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 would say
 
 would telephone conference.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 requires telephone conference.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could ask estimate
 length time move?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 Two weeks.
 
 most?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Mr. Chairman, guess depends one
 listens things, sense majority
 people wanted tightening, say, next couple weeks.
 would seem one way would say
 implementation policy etc., Committee seeks increase
 slightly degree pressure reserve positions immediate
 weeks ahead.

 MR. ANGELL. But, Ed, count four people favored
 immediate tightening.
 MR. BOEHNE. it's immediate; it's spread

 No, no.
 
 I'm talking count
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Oh.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. HELLER. found papers interesting really

 confusion would result,
 think, would great. think would useful, however,

 treat level existing targets. one thing
 that's important, too, Kohn saying--namely,
 behavior likely change introduce target.
 certain, introduce constraint, old statistical
 relationships probably won't hold anymore. case, that's
 would come out: I'd treat two same. I'd favor

 MR. MELZER. Well, problem

 think proposed ability really influence policy
 actions, extremes, constructive way. don't
 know get you're suggesting. would
 easier explain; there's doubt it.
 MR. HELLER. Well then, let's rename targets; let's
 call constraints something like that. know, take
 range seriously [the growth rates] get closer borders,
 influences way vote current monetary targets.
 don't take absolute, things would indicate
 going opposite way. President Morris saying earlier: Would
 go voluntarily recession would otherwise
 necessary stick constraint? answer would
 no.
 Immediately, already set escape clauses too. So,
 think much monetary targets;
 they're same, take monetary targets
 seriously take constraint. I'm favor looking it;
 among various options there, would strongly
 inclined call two different things.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, lot sympathy
 Tom trying think ultimate objective
 achieve price stability. don't know Committee would vote
 that, remember several years ago Chairman Volcker asked us
 thought objective half us voted price
 stability alone; half voted way; didn't vote
 didn't break tie. think ultimate objective,
 hear people around saying that. think Tom
 trying create constraint make us really work toward
 objective lose sight it. problem
 even though thinks constraint, believe,
 practice, really might end used like target.
 analysis, like Bob Parry's, suggests M2 really better
 sense predicting level long-run inflation.
 that, think, thing really ought look at, rather
 well predicts nominal GNP, since don't think peg real
 variables long run. affect price level.
 So, would like carry thing step
 Tom has, suggest think using total reserves
 nonborrowed reserves, something sort, operating
 instrument. akin using free reserves,
 fraught problems whole time. know
 institutional changes improve this--you could
 get rid reserve requirements interbank deposits,
 [unintelligible] deposits, nonpersonal deposits, things.
 could penalty discount rate. things could

 event, could work direction, think we'd
 course, one
 something would really useful us.
 things would want analyze might shortterm market rates, don't think good handle that.
 people think would fluctuate lot more; instincts tell
 private market would take care that. And, even
 fluctuated more, don't believe would transmitted longterm rates extent people seem assuming.
 case, could use operating variable instead
 borrowed reserves, federal funds rate, whatever people think
 we're using, think would efficient way try
 achieve thing Tom advocating. Now, came

 say suggested. I'd like take that,
 think it's better have,

 MR. JOHNSON. Well, going follow
 there's much difficult technical issue. Even agree
 goal--if 100 percent consensus price stability
 wanted, think probably almost everybody would say
 today--you'd still whole lot disagreement
 means. Agreeing goal important first step,
 you'd run kinds problems, like: mean

 there's oil price shock, one big relative price
 economy obviously flows through, it's going

 deal every one those, you're going
 tighten relative
 chasing tail, think.
 price shock, you're going potentially overshoot;
 filters economy, it's going create overreaction
 downside point, you're going trying
 work back up.
 So, me, price stability means long-run concept.
 may mean you're never actually experiencing perfect level

 price stability prices hovering around zero.
 mean mean somewhat around zero; even you'd

 could debate whether people think ought go periods

 get
 kinds difficult debates proper measure price

 It's difficult problem. still think goal
 price stability, rather than, say, trying improve
 unemployment rate maximize real output growth, step
 right direction.
 think time, probably, wasn't
 clear; people would said Phillip's curve trade
 acceptance permanent inflation worthwhile.

 don't think that's true anymore, still think

 get hung goals, want say
 specific proposal, though, think would succeed
 damping volatility base. upper lower bounds
 constraints, think, would cause monetary policy adjust early
 you're approaching bounds rather deal big roller coaster

 MR. HELLER. Yes, Mike saying look first month,
 you're really-MR. MELZER.

 Well, let put context
 
 MR. KELLEY. look first month, it's like
 kind thing Peter deals every day, regard
 maintenance period. instance, let's take October: October
 number 11 percent annualized basis.
 followed
 November 6.9 percent December 3.1 percent; averages
 fine.

 October might moved something precipitous.
 MR. MELZER. Well, first all, think staff would

 look
 right quarter, probably right at, preciously

 MR. KELLEY.
 
 April 12.3 percent.
 
 MR. MELZER. Okay. can't look monthly

 correctly--I'm looking St. Louis base--we roughly
 think 9 percent constraint would be, little
 it.
 So, would asking meeting like this:
