 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. ye, mike, i'd like follow-up question
 governor seger's question. appar, optimum growth
 rate mind, let's sai, next four quarter. would
 optimum growth rate be?
 mr. prell. don't know optimum growth rate.
 basic, sens pressur resourc great
 point hold inflat rate recent level.
 feel eas [of pressur] necessari. believ
 trend real output growth somewher around 2-1/2 percent.
 therefor, believ we've got grow someth
 order eas pressur. recogn uncertainti
 natur rate unemploy is, that's oper
 concept. recogn composit activ make
 differ of--. rough judgment, ultim; don't want
 get precis it, basic think need
 addit restraint get economi potenti,
 believ probabl necessari.
 mr. angel. but, mike, precis help
 commun. take time pry number
 ask seri question, would save time you'd
 simpli tell us.
 mr. prell. think cite number 2-1/2 percent,
 governor angel, believ potenti gnp growth is.
 therefor, depend fast want get inflat rate
 down.
 
 if--
 
 mr. angel. would think would optimum
 adjust process? mean, like 1-1/2 percent better
 2-1/2 percent?
 
 9/20/88
 
 mr. prell. well, you're ask make polici judgment,

 mr. angel. but, mike, there's polici assumpt involv
 interest rate forecast sure whether you'd
 prefer 1-1/2 percent real gnp growth 1/2 percent gnp growth
 neg 1/2 percent.
 i'd like better understand
 think would take order get best adjust.
 mr. prell. again, don't feel i'm posit declar

 suspect, go around tabl here,
 policymak would differ view risk
 would want take rapidli would want move bring

 aim kind inflat
 trajectori you've outlin--declin 1 percent year

 last statement final answer
 
 governor johnson.
 
 mr. johnson. mike, sai feder fund rate

 lee ask, forgot.
 sai 9-1/2 percent?
 mr. prell. we're look around 9-1/2 percent.
 don't want precis.
 mr. johnson.
 mr. prell.
 
 again,
 
 ye, know.

 mr. johnson. you're sai proport move

 mr. prell.

 mr. johnson. question
 haven't seen kind trend move fund rate

 actual sharp flatten yield curv. long rate stai
 were, mayb go some, much less

 think yield curv flatten
 
 9/20/88
 
 2-1/2 percentag point less 1 percentag point.
 trend continu? would forecast sai move
 9-1/2 percent fund rate accompani proport
 move long bond? kind differenti effect would
 have?
 mr. prell. know, extrem flatten
 recent phenomenon. earlier year, get
 substanti increas long rate short rate rose. guess
 underli project, least mind, sens
 market mai overdon thing recent part mai
 lack long bond author unusu tight long end
 market point. would fairli

 forecast, partli presumpt market
 surpris degre take order damp
 inflationari pressur. would come around view;
 there's strict intern consist forecast.
 mr. johnson.
 
 no, that's okai.
 
 mr. prell. rate don't rise--, might rise
 much number reason. on could chang
 inflationari expect. mai recent,
 appar willing fed move earlier
 would thought mai help hold long-rang inflat

 get signific real rate effect thu damp influenc
 demand. event transpir caus real rate rise
 much would anticip forecast, might
 differ outcom invest demand mai sustain bit
 [in forecast]. innumer scenario
 on could draw movement long rate would differ

 mr. johnson. understand. i'm sai is, let's assum
 it's inflationari expect adjust, that's long
 rate haven't gone up. sai continu case,
 fund rate goe 9-1/2 percent without much chang long
 bond due improv inflationari expect someth like
 that. would differenti impact that?
 mr. prell. you're sai flatten occur
 entir reduc inflat expect-mr. johnson.
 
 okai, entir, let's sai, debat
 
 extrem.
 mr. prell. would depend short run part
 whether chang long-run percept
 inflationari trend would part whether
 reflect sens economi might head toward
 recess. clearli, histor experi we've seen
 mark flatten yield curv downturn
 economi. move short rate much we're talk
 long rate didn't rise all--that would
 steep downward slope. suspect would occur
 
 9/20/88
 
 circumst peopl would perceiv signific
 likelihood near-term weaken economi.
 mr. johnson. view is, though, expect
 revis near futur long bond move
 back up?
 mr. prell. that's basic we're assum. it's
 difficult psych market point. on come
 number altern hypothes market behav
 wai recent--in interpret recent new on.
 anoth factor dollar situat, term longer-run

 that. that's probabl factor that's go less favor
 move along project period. and, suggest, we're
 presum market perceiv greater degre

 current is. come around [unintellig].
 mr. johnson. that's case, long bond
 would surpris upward move.
 mr. prell.
 
 right.

 mr. boehn. mike, you've made think rather persuas
