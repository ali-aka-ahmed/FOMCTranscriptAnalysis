 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. it's interesting analytical
 question whether one make judgment you're making--in

 MR. HOSKINS. It's really Sam. It's
 observation. may Ted Truman Kohn. question
 Ed Boehne raised--and Jerry also commented on--in respect
 using currency market intervention large open economies, think
 empirical evidence sterilize don't get
 effects intervention time. I'd interested hearing
 comments empirical research think question-SPEAKER(?). Now, technical kind question
 sense really want alter monetary policy use
 currency markets way it--that is, allow money supply
 grow shrink match doing--I think
 different question.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's question monetary policy.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, research done--much
 here--and report intervention done
 multilaterally. actual report intervention done [the G7 central banks finance ministers] suggested sterilized
 intervention may effective short run likely
 lasting effects. end somewhat tied semantic
 problem, it's little hard say $100 billion
 $150 billion intervention last year effect
 whatsoever. think thrust research might say
 effect, it's whole--small [unintelligible].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. [Unintelligible] think
 argument make sterilizing intervention
 short effect would meaningful extent
 alter psychology portfolio adjustment process.
 huge stock assets there, psychology irrelevant
 consideration get substantial moves
 [unintelligible] period time change fundamentals,
 would read evidence. Long term, can't anything
 isn't. short term think it's ambiguous

 [unintelligible].
 don't know anyone solve debate

 3/29/88
 
 MR. JOHNSON. think lot depends way
 fundamentals taking exchange rate, too.
 It's lot easier
 intervention speed adjustment it's supporting
 direction fundamentals. you're trying fight
 fundamentals, think it's much difficult--the seventies
 good example and, recently, last couple years.

 work even psychology, it's much fleeting,
 think.

 think much contrasting positions, points
 continuum. think pretty much back so-called
 "normal", remembering "normal" involve close awareness
 what's happening funds rate. mid-October
 last year, now.
 MR. JOHNSON. First, going say compliment
 everyone involved study careful presentation
 issues. think it's well done balanced. also compliment
 people preparing remark page four says:
 "And money market rates, rather division reserves
 borrowed non-borrowed components,
 direct impact financial variables markets--such longterm interest rates, exchange rates, money growth--through
 monetary policy transmitted economy." That's point
 I've trying make while, transmission
 funds rate adjustment fundamental feature
 monetary policy we're dealing here--whether it's effect
 money growth, relative interest rates, whatever.
 That's transmission mechanism; it's borrowed reserves.
 Borrowed reserves simply mechanism adjust funds
 rate, it's simple that.
 Now, think legitimate argument
 way it.
 think point made memo
 borrowed reserve target allow variability funds
 rate market forces show through. However,
 personal view, others may differ it, major reason
 variation funds rate pursuing borrowed reserve target
 market forces--it's basically reserve estimate errors
 problems associated reserve equation. rare market
 forces actually major factor variation funds rate,
 even though might show up. trying
 sensitive directly funds rate means setting monetary
 policy, still allow market forces affect
 funds rate. don't go market three times day
 adjust funds rate keep within narrow range. think
 now--to extent,
 earlier--which indicates
 sensitive toward funds rate borrowing objective.
 enter market day normal time, operations
 geared toward sensitivity funds rate toward
 borrowing objective really meaning
 influence funds rate.
 Chart 2 paper beautiful chart shows
 problems procedure we've following.
 paper prepared back July, believe was, excellent
 paper too--it pointed consistent bias actual
 borrowings expected levels. didn't know exactly why;
 number potential explanations that. it's also
 illustrated Chart 2. important upward bias
 actual versus expected chart, fact don't agree
 argument paper short periods
 deviation borrowings expectations expected funds rates,
 it's clearly case. One piece information
 missing chart often intermeeting conference
 calls arrangements FOMC explain variations
 
 3/29/88
 
 -11-
 
 expectations; assume expected line takes account.
 instance, there's prolonged period spring 1987--I think
 everyone remembers distinctly--where clearly
 see early months 1987 huge spike adjustment
 seasonal borrowing expected range. took place
 two-month period. wasn't short fluctuation borrowings
 relative expectations. huge spike. remember,
 borrowings averaged almost $800 million entire intermeeting
 period expected borrowing $300 $400
 million. That's little fluctuation; prolonged
 period actual borrowing well expected level. see
 expected level tick couple times there.
 intermeeting conference call took place April 30th,
 adjusted borrowing assumption $300 million $400 million.
 see doesn't nearly compensate actual
 borrowing. go back longer period earlier--you see
 middle 1986--when borrowings clearly averaged well
 expectations 4-month period; 1985 another good
 example. see chart.
 So, think serious issue whether
 actually keep borrowings expected path. problem
 is: What's point anyway? point achieve
 reasonable range funds rate, represents transmission
 mechanism monetary policy economy. So, think
 charts data available clearly show
 problems approach. Now, I'm sure
 something drastically different. I've satisfied
 way operations run last several months.
 don't see can't pursue procedure consistent
 sensitive funds rate rather borrowing objective.
 doesn't make sense would otherwise.
 last point would make can't buy
 view sensitive funds rate got us
 trouble 1970s. wasn't then--maybe
 were--but talking people trying study
 period, tell, mere fact trying
 sensitive funds rate wasn't actually problem.
 gather money growth wasn't bad relative targets
 period. anything, misunderstanding
 money supply measures like problems
 now. Also, think probably slightly
 different philosophy. we're big boys it's hard believe
 can't sit table agree set monetary policy
 be, whether it's sensitive funds rate
 what. don't buy that, means agree
 procedure tricks us right monetary policy.
 can't buy it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm glad raised issue
 share lot frustrations Manley voiced.
 thought time problem choosing

 doesn't really much impact. frequently, deviations
 
 3/29/88

 rather long rather large; effect, think end
 changing stance monetary policy Committee wants
 misleading market, too. Manley stated well, think
 federal funds rate important thing determining
 demand money behavior aggregates time.
 think Committee confused this, times
 we've gotten federal funds rates we'd expected
 led misunderstanding. example,

 Now, couple arguments advanced

 become concerned procedure really involves
 trying fool public Congress markets,
 times fooling process.
 I'd like suggest, time it,
 alternative procedure might conceivably satisfactory

 sides.
 funds rate, let's say weekly average 50 basis points, would

 that, Desk, consultation you, Mr. Chairman, would

 give us leeway market forces work. could

 would consultation Committee. think
 would clear us would work much
 better, sometimes get federal funds rates
 didn't vote didn't want. So, think move direction
 would hate
 would helpful clearly would honest.
 defend grounds that,
 I'd
 sense, really don't want people know to.
 rather stand up, Manley says, like man,
 do. understand argument, '79, I'm sure

 MR. HELLER. Thank you. also much enjoyed

 "Movements federal funds rate convey information policy

 second point find difficult believe

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think reluctance make

 MR. HELLER. So, wasn't bad procedure, would argue.
 sort lack moral fiber that-MR. STERNLIGHT. I'd regard aspect

 think he's saying system really isn't broke let's
 fix it. It's working better expected would work,
 theoretically would work, that's enough.
 seems really three kinds

 think issue two things
 inescapable. One it's lot easier ease monetary policy
 tighten. don't care indicators you're using;
 don't care philosophy is; it's lot easier go one way
 other. think history monetary policy
 around world ultimately tied question. think it's
 also true, Manley said, borrowings number obviously
 proxy bunch things. federal funds rate.
 Indeed, there's nothing particularly appealing federal funds
 rate itself. pick federal funds rates, different
 points time associated wildly different patterns
 economic activity, inflation, rest it.
 absolutely magic federal funds rate relationship
 things really care about. funds rate sense
 merely symbolic bunch things. So, whether you're talking
 borrowings funds rate, think, sense, you're talking
 proxy collection things.
 that's partly answer Governor Heller's question
 why, procedure lousy, results good.
 think answer is, part, look
 procedures. words, focus simply
 transmission variables proxy variables; look
 things make judgments based see
 economy, inflation, rest. Indeed, seems
 that's conditional elements directive language.
 reinforces view, judgment, things
 focusing imperfect proxies things really care about.
 don't fully agree argument move away
 federal funds rate simply politically driven decision,
 especially one motivated obfuscation. think
 fundamental that. think reflect earlier experience.
 experience was, Frank said, staring roaring
 inflation face. chose [not] to, unwilling to,
 recognize respond it. So, think there's
 politics obfuscation. also think there's
 another sense. seems that, regardless use

 that. That's question think table.

 you're talking federal funds rate discrete number--that

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 add it!
 
 is, think Frank Morris
 
 MR. MORRIS. said last meeting, think
 we're really current procedure targeting
 federal funds rate. reason target borrowing,
 means automatically supplying nonborrowed reserves
 extent market demands it.
 means demand
 reserves strong, we'll supply increased rate reserve growth
 order effect keeping federal funds rate
 
 -23-

 rising.
 demand reserves low, reduce amount
 nonborrowed reserves keep federal funds rate
 falling. didn't mean we're pegging funds rate way
 back 1960s 1970s. think
 keeping fed funds rate within certain range. think
 don't agree Bob Black
 desirable thing do.
 think
 publish range federal funds rate--if meant that.
 politically we're lot better present form

 interest rates sizable chunks, we're going lot better

 hand,
 range 50 basis points something like that.
 think
 don't think kid we're doing.
 there's good reason staying present procedure,
 recognize we're controlling rate growth
 reserves--we're controlling federal funds rate within band.
 So, think problems borrowings--if
 banks reluctant borrow reason, there's
 technical reason borrowing getting line

 interest rates ought dominant borrowing target.
 think precisely Peter's doing, that's
 think zigs zags

 MR. JOHNSON.

 MR. MORRIS. think would undesirable. So,
 think de facto, controlling borrowing functional equivalent
 controlling fed funds rate. time think
 would unwise political reasons change format

 I'm saying exactly you're saying, Frank.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 I'm saying exactly you're now, except avoid
 big zigs zags borrowings instead funds rate. That's
 I'm saying.
 MR. MORRIS.
 think learned 1970s--and
 keep back minds--is publishing funds
 
 -24-
 
 3/29/88
 
 range time need push funds rate would pose
 hazardous duty. never get back that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 I'm sorry, publishing funds?
 
 Publishing directive Manager
 MR. MORRIS.
 keep funds rate within small range.
 think would
 unwise us go back that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, heard Bob Heller's
 remarks, going say ain't broke don't fix it,
 somebody already said that.
 Let start procedural matter.
 First all, thought memos, particularly Meulendyke paper,
 extremely useful.
 wasn't around 1970s found
 historical perspective interesting. would like suggest
 somebody think publishing somewhere market
 look at.
 said that, let say something nasty now,
 is, enjoyed reading memo, didn't much time
 read reached yesterday morning. raise
 issue context discussion we're going
 frequent consultations, hasn't discussed,
 consultations frequently accompanying memoranda;
 don't get time really reflect them, don't us
 much good.
 turning substance issue, seems
 went this, agree Governor Johnson
 really little policy difference targeting
 borrowing targeting funds rate.
 think really targeting
 federal funds rate, general way. I'm persuaded
 make change three basic reasons,
 think touched speakers.
 First all,
 seem get useful information market,
 deviation funds rate relation borrowing.
 Many times market induced, think policymakers
 learn something market telling us.
 Secondly,
 perhaps importantly, seems using borrowing
 target proxy funds rate--or, like, policy-we're able probe little better funds rate
 target.
 say, uncertainty generated sometimes
 borrowing differential funds rate would enable us
 reverse policy found desirable. funds
 rate targeting, don't kind flexibility.
 So, think
 get flexibility using borrowing target.
 political argument talked think
 ought underestimate that, get period
 tighten policy, it's difficult thing
 politically. times it's difficult others.
 don't
 think posture past publicly identified
 
 targeting interest rates--certainly recent years.
 
 don't
 
 think it's good idea us institution
 backs.
 people look realities, obviously they'll see
 really targeting funds rate; think get advantage
 staying away targeting funds rate itself.
 think
 market regular basis too, Manley; don't
 
 3/29/88
 
 -25-
 
 think haphazard basis.
 
 think
 
 market couple times day really fine tune it.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 mean borrowing what?
 
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 targeting funds rate.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. funds rate. Oh, don't think need
 anything different you're now. You'd go
 day, around 11:40 a.m., action Desk took would
 sensitive towards rate protest would toward borrowing
 protest.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 the--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. That's difference would
 pursue. matter fact, would exactly Peter
 last several weeks. I'm saying think
 outstanding.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, that's point wanted
 make. find getting major deviations, think
 correct that. don't think ought funds
 targeting regular basis. Now, two things
 said think need addressed. doesn't seem
 sense misleading markets policy;
 don't think it's deliberate obfuscation. think markets
 understand, understand certainly, monetary policy
 exact science. don't think using borrowing target
 designed mislead anybody. Also, don't think
 deviations--to use analogy somebody else did--are causing us
 airplane crash course ground. don't think
 we're anywhere near that. Nobody mentioned intermeeting
 consultation discretion, let raise
 issue, Mr. Chairman.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 mentioned it.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. mentioned it; excuse me, must
 asleep time. think it's important Manager,
 consultation Chairman, discretion. I, one,
 would like limit discretion kind numerical
 bounds. One thing think could regular meetings FOMC
 give sense Chairman feel
 deviations policy reversal policy. think
 done general way, without saying want change $100
 million come Committee; would leave Chairman.
 could general discussion think,
 general terms, consultation necessary. finally, don't
 think need meetings FOMC.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Ever?
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. don't think information gained,
 say, monthly basis, sufficient us come together

 schedule, gentlemen.

 3/29/88
 
 MR. JOHNSON. would too, we're going exactly
 we've doing. think that's consistent I'm
 
 arguing.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 I'm saying, basically, keep
 
 we're because, Bob Heller suggests, maybe we've lucky.
 maybe won't turn quite good
 
 recent past, think that's something accept.
 willing accept deviations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 I'd
 
 President Boehne.
 
 Well, think everything
 
 said conversation. It's question emphasizing points.
 first point debate theoretically,
 conceptually, forever, it's frustrating
 involves compromise. trying take two different approaches
 compromise that's satisfying. seems
 choice, then, comes works. preference would
 get back October 19th,
 think doing. don't think we're quite back there,
 we're almost there.
 couple reasons preference. One
 seem worked reasonably well. point made
 earlier matter procedure have, it's always easy
 ease; that's problem. We've never trouble there.
 real day comes need tighten. I'm sure everybody around
 table much stronger much forthright,
 courage guts anybody else history Fed,
 think lessons history. experience
 shown focus federal funds rate,
 difficult time need tighten, it. So,
 think need keep bit fuzziness there. would,
 practical grounds, stay are.
 issues: agree point Chairman
 needs discretion. way upset way
 discretion used. Maybe would used little
 differently, think whole done rather well.
 don't think ought hem Chairman numerical kinds
 constraints. way, however, perhaps communication
 sometimes improved. don't mean suggest needs
 done every time Chairman uses discretion,
 telephone conferences. conferences official
 meetings; decision-making meetings.
 simply held exchange views--a kind meeting really never
 gets record aren't decisions made. So, might
 possible, right kinds situations, simply
 telephone hookups.

 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 see need point change
 current procedures. Harking back Ed Boehne's analogy 1 10,
 

 
 thought us would prefer go back
 something like total reserves target nonborrowed reserve target
 procedure point time. Keeping framework that's
 currently place allows us keep hope alive extent,
 
 whereas go straight explicit funds rate targeting think
 would disservice. It's hard reverse
 process; experience 1970s leads believe that.
 
 would
 
 stay are, terms we're this. terms
 Chairman's discretion, really don't much say that;
 think he's got ability make decisions.
 don't see easy way limit order fulfill
 responsibilities. think it's matter trust, I'm comfortable
 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, wasn't confused
 discussion, guess would now. don't know
 much add. thinking structure Bluebook, guess
 I'm persuaded focusing borrowing target focusing
 funds rate basically come thing. read
 policy options [in Bluebook] give borrowing
 levels interest rate they're consistent with.
 honestly either way. Presumably, pop kinds
 equations. said that, think one major reasons
 discussion come fundamental problem
 we're aware of--and we've agonized several years now-which breakdown money/GNP relationship. Without that,
 probably wouldn't going this, we'd
 comfortable situation able focus M1, M2,
 something else, proceed along lines.
 said that, guess preference
 continuing operate way prior October 19th--which
 don't think far way we've operating last
 weeks either--simply think that, margin,
 value going reserve side thought process.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think maybe ought clarify
 would like say, first all, I'm
 statements.
 sympathetic Governor Angell say:
 really ought control supply reserves manner
 control whatever monetary aggregate going determine
 don't think really,
 level prices long run.
 long run, control real variables; control nominal
 ones.
 think objective ought stable prices. that's
 way would want it.
 ever get millennium,
 think required reserves probably going best target
 us whatever aggregate settle on. wouldn't want
 bands federal funds range all; would want
 free move enough allow us hit target.
 talking earlier interim period demand
 money unstable present procedures call us try
 gauge dimensions demand money set operating
 variable best give us kind results want.
 think that's federal funds rate.
 far issue discretion concerned,
 mean take away flexibility. trying suggest band
 reasonable--that would agreeable whole Committee
 I'd like
 operating range within could adjust rate.
 use whole band--that 50-basis-point-average range talked
 about--and understanding went beyond that,
 would consult Committee. discussion,
 remember, last meeting maybe shouldn't changed
 borrowed reserve target without consultation. didn't hold
 view, did. thought important reach
 agreement would consultation that's reason
 suggested it.
 But, basically, don't want long
 run federal funds rate all.
 want
 reserves, somehow measured, get back rational
 financial [unintelligible].
 So, that's come out.

 recommendation applies interim period we're in,
 thought would prevent going back [reserve
 targeting]--Lee, said--let change position.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Let say, always different.
 
 MR. BLACK. Let change position want get,
 think, want get.
 would jeopardize that,
 I've made bad mistake.

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 But, again, seems that's
 
 the-MR. HELLER. Well, looking chart
 thought Committee votes.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. think it's crucial you,
 Mr. Chairman, tried say before, ultimately
 question table here--aside substantive
 question--is conditions procedures create
 situation are, effect, required make public
 statement--through testimony, speech, one way another--that
 Fed policy changed. don't want get situation
 every two months every two weeks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let tell would define it.
 would define policy change one resulting change
 economic fundamentals FOMC perceive,
 anticipated, required form adjustment.
 Incremental
 changes fine tune policy changes.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Okay; then, many things
 would policy changes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 Don, that's way look it.
 But, think it's important Committee, Chairman,
 
 3/29/88
 
 define constitutes policy change. It's discretion
 Committee set policy. It's discretion, hear
 here, Desk consultation Chairman merely fine
 tune context. cannot simultaneously Desk
 Chairman define change policy is,
 necessity always override Committee. So, think required
 get agreement constitutes change policy.
 read it, meeting there's consensus emerges
 respect outlook is, implicit
 directive. Often directive vague; somebody
 tell extremely sharp [unintelligible] set
 instructions, would tell don't understand language.
 clear preceding discussion general
 impression is, various numbers were--[the context]
 constructed directive. rather sophisticated
 insights difficult put down, think
 unambiguous. know somebody asked FOMC's
 views last meeting, I'd trouble describing them-not directive terms, terms Committee evaluated
 economy financial system it, therefore, thought
 appropriate policy. best see it, things change
 Committee's view outlook changing
 therefore alters structure directive--that would consider
 change policy.
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, perspective
 policy change first February?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 No, not.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Okay; that's assuming--that
 didn't. then, went Congress, thought
 indication policy change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, think merely
 affirmation markets questioning: whether, fact,
 nudged slightly funds rate--which had,
 1/8th. reason put time
 statement policy change, affirmation markets
 discussing.
 MR. ANGELL. think focuses point you're
 looking adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, small change
 might consistent with, what, $50 million change?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 $50 million change.
 
 MR. ANGELL. $50 million change. Clearly, seems me,
 make $50 million change borrowing, it's slight
 wouldn't consider policy change wouldn't announce it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, think issue much
 whether announced whether confirmed
 not. reason chose to, time, lot people
 asking question, simplest way resolving it-instead sphinxlike--was admit it.

 MR. ANGELL. think that's Jerry's point: targeting

 want that?
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 don't see would case.
 
 MR. ANGELL. It's market able discern [a
 change desired funds rate].
 adjustment plus seasonal
 borrowing procedure, market wouldn't known, 1/8th
 point move.
 MR. JOHNSON. say that's policy change.
 wouldn't policy change?
 

 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. really gets question
 definition change is, extremely rare
 big discontinuities involved here. there's awful lot
 ambiguity go there; it's clear cut
 thing. must say attended FOMC meetings,
 different view constitutes nature policy,
 used read directives couldn't life figure
 world talking about. now, given
 FOMC meetings I've attended, I'm realizing is.
 MR. HELLER. there's difference long-run
 short-run policy, too. think Jerry addressing earlier.
 you're setting long-run monetary growth targets, order
 change long-run policy you're making short-term adjustment-let's say borrowing targets--to get closer that, argue
 long-run policy unchanged, therefore, you've got
 change short-term tactics. think that's ambiguity
 comes in.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That's part it. Regardless
 use indicators proxies, think one way
 another try project underlying forward looking
 consistency policy ultimately overrides noise.
 Again, said before, think part problem
 us, way, looks noise anyway. Obviously,
