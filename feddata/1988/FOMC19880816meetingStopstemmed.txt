 8/16/88
 
 -13-
 
 ms. seger. mike, could elabor littl bit

 know mention fed fund
 expect reach 9-1/2 percentbi next spring, think said
 long-term treasuri bond, 10-1/2 percent.
 it's hard hear
 morn end tabl, think said 10-1/2 percent

 mr. prell. again, express recogn

 notic
 ms. seger. mortgag rate?
 commentari indic think hous probabl number on

 look forecast number didn't see realli major
 downward revis.
 so, mayb tell kind mortgag-mr. prell. we've made modest downward revis
 hous start get 1989 wai. we've made
 upward adjust mortgag rate forecast. mortgag rate
 run bit tighter treasuri previous.
 mortgag rate get toward 12 percent second

 ms. seger. 12 percent.
 chairman greenspan. question
 either gentleman?
 not, readi round robin.
 would like start off?
 mr. boykin. well, mr. chairman, i'll start eleventh
