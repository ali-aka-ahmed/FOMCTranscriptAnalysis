 question two gentlemen?
 
 speaker(?).

 agre you.
 
 mr. prell. automobil--inde, automobil

 mr. prell.
 it's conceiv, certainli extent
 isn't respons earli excess inventori
 accumul, could build larger problem,
 subsequ could give us cycl.
 [unintellig] we'd
 even dramat inventori correct earlier
 upsw--and number short-run correct-and, cours, that's critic ingredi.
 speaker(?).
 follow inventori question--the
 distinct manufactur inventori retail inventori.
 think show chart consist
 anecdot evid on pick up.
 howev, there's on area
 i, least, haven't abl get much anecdot evid.
 mention i've heard elsewher.
 accumul retail inventori plan--wa desir
 effect--to beat higher price import.
 could expound that?
 mr. prell. well, think that's hard pin down.
 isn't price, also perhap case apparel
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 earlier part last year, concern quota restrict.
 gener issu price whether manufactur, exampl,
 saw materi input price increas sharpli case,

 accumul. wasn't faster; fact, slower,

 could still signific desir build inventori
 further. moder accumul manufactur'

 mr. hoskin. mike, don't know whether
 appropri question you, mayb later discuss,
 first monetari polici object state, essenti, want
 maximum output without signific acceler inflat. on
 could revers sai want achiev deceler
 inflat without significantli damag employ output.

 mr. prell. well, suppos certainli someth

 i'm skeptic fourth-quarter number.
 
 mr. prell.
 it's volatil seri month-to-month.
 think, perhap term lead indic valu--and
 probabl doesn't point far futur--that it's on littl

 2/9-10/88

 isn't consensu forecast p&e probabl
 excess 5 percent growth? forecast, i've seen

 chairman greenspan.
 
 question mr. truman?
 
 speaker(?). look long-term interest rate
 germani, real long-term rate unusu high. some-mr. truman. well, think it's puzzl. ask
 german thei're high, sai german saver won't accept
 interest rate lower 6 percent assum
 long-term inflat rate much higher current.
 matter talk wai around that, that's answer get
 back. true even last year, coupl
 year, [market] interest rate come down, [rate]
 stai 6 percent. fact, seri us
 slightli underst movement rate, it's averag
 longer-term ten-year public author issu.
 much less ten year matur.
 sluggish seri. exampl, ten-year bond
 outstand, rate 6 percent, 6-1/4 percent.
 come bit seri show recent,
 still high. save stori,
 peopl would point critic imperfect cartel
 financi market germani; it's much explan.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. ye. sinc presid hoskin mention
 monetari polici object, guess i'd like make even stronger
 statement regard that. wai state somewhat
 differ it's written. wai state less offens
 wai it's written. wai it's written contrari
 everyth believ job is, caus
 wonder: miss someth two year
 state befor?
 ms. seger.
 
 it's employ act '46.
 
 mr. angel. whatev is, seem that's
 object is, alwai go edg
 disast. don't know els put it. back chart 19--and
 want presid realiz i'm impress
 scholarship forecast, indic
 staff--but haven't yet seen happen chart 19
 unchang dollar tighter u.s. monetari polici. now, presum
 mean monei growth like 1987.

 approxim correct?
 mr. kohn. '88 would same; '89
 would sever percentag point less.
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 mr. angel.
 word, m2 growth '88
 scenario would 4 percent?
 mr. kohn.
 mr. angel.
 mr. kohn.
 
 approxim.
 would '89?
 on two percent guess--in area.
 
 mr. angel. oh!
 see. quit restrict path.
 bother outcom.
 disagre regard
 sign result interest rate.
 would seem me,
 adopt smaller monei growth path lower real gnp
 detail here, fed fund rate might 2 3 percent less
 than, rather 2 3 percent greater than. would comment
 that?
 speaker(?).
 think exercis involv move
 interest rate impact economi back monei
 demand, measur standard monei demand equat.
 wai work, lot wai cut thi. but,
 essenti, slowdown nomin gnp, 1-1/2
 percentag point year--a littl less, 1-1/4--is associ
 kind interest rate rise on hand, get sharp
 reduct, too, partli colleagu
 sai quit while--becaus consider interest
 elast monei number.
 mr. angel. well, appar it's model. guess
 time time bother me. model us
 close model wai would assum economi work.
 mr. kohn. ultim, think on differenti
 short-run simul that's present here--where slow
 monei growth, interest rate go up, slow demand
 monei real economi--and longer-run effect might
 slow monei growth, ultim get price level down,
 would lower inflat would come back
 trend rate growth economi.
 fact, model
 characterist: slow monei growth, would
 come back to, essenti, trend rate growth economi
 whole. mai rememb discuss yesterdai [dure
 staff brief board], question function
 econom forecast whole. characterist.
 short run, wouldn't pai much attent extent
 tighter monetari polici; would give calibr
 kind monetari polici would produc.
 mr. angel. guess depend upon soon expect
 expect realiz. model would us would
 differ chain event.
 would seem me-speaker(?).
 ye, could see
 consum price measur 1988.
 thought
 big expect compon rate inflat,
 slower, deliber slower, monetari growth--of cours,
 someth difficult captur model--you would get much
 
 2/9-10/88
 
 less nomin gnp. would feedback effect;
 would lower interest rate.
 
 fact,
 
 consid somewhat import,
 mr. angel.
 believ fast growth rate monei stock would
 result lower interest rate, would inclin choos
 polici.
 speaker(?).
 
 short run.
 
 mr. prell. governor angel, let sai--i don't want
 unduli defens assumpt--we aren't make
 norm prescript committe. tri emphas,
 saw economi current posit, look question
 much room growth wa. sens, us,
 issu forecast context sort asymmetr-we look much room felt grow without
 move inflat trend much awai been. that's
 try commun assumpt.
 mr. angel. would admit, wouldn't mike, "c"
 isn't pretti pictur?
 mr. prell. well, on, think question
 think alwai run
 dynam expect effect.
 question take account tighter polici. alwai
 requir higher interest rate short run. get
 lower growth monei balanc line desir level,
 could get differ path thereaft.
 best guess, us model, differ would
 forecast made. yet it's prescript; it's
 try give sens sensit forecast
 assumpt exchang rate monetari growth.
 mr. angel. well, seem sounder monei

 mr. black. mr. chairman, i've frank morri' camp

 sound sensibl?
 mr. prell. great deal commentari
 number. 1 think point out, perhap greenbook,
 subsequ shipment data surfac look stronger
 bea thi. translat, limit data
 have, complic on. shipment export
 well domest purchas; intermedi good,
 shouldn't show end; question season
 pattern season adjust goe
 tax law chang. p&e number drag automobil
 sale, part shipment data. so, it's
 complic calcul. guess, certainli expect
 revis degre, isn't clear won't still end
 declin p&e fourth quarter.
 mr. black. guess still find hard believ view

 guess sort rumor seriou-mr. black.
 
 fellow said talk
 
 probabl
 exact reason; hadn't thought that,
 [unintellig]-speaker(?). ye, thought declin 3.8 percent.
 read on [correctli,] it's 7.2 percent fourth
 quarter. get 3.8?
 mr. prell. pde declin 7 percent. it's 3.6 percent
 total bfi fourth quarter. i'd like emphas
 season adjust phenomenon bounc number around
 time futur. old depreci rule, compani
 could bui someth decemb get, guess, half year's
 depreci. tax reform, pile much fourth

 that's good point.
 
 2/9-10/88

 [it could affect the] third-quarter/fourthquart swing now, third quarter 2.6
 percent.
 speaker(?).
 
 ye.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. well, ever sinc brief yesterdai, mike,
 i've try figur can't understand point
 fourth-quarter gnp number came out--which show weaker
 consumpt spend greater inventori accumul believ
 forecast--how number,

 upward revis forecast first half year.
 must sai arithmet still fli right me. so, mayb
 try convinc it; i'm sure it's densiti

 speaker(?).
 
 explan
 
 [unintellig]
 
 it's revers.
 
 mr. prell. don't exactli go clean slate
 time.
 certain follow-through earlier
 guess didn't feel overal
 [forecast].
 product growth go tail quit fast built
 [earlier], base order trend employ data
 end year. sens consum spend
 look weak
 fall apart year end.
 earli fall didn't show much growth end year,
 didn't seem fall apart. surmis that,
 everyth els could look at, probabl stock market
 psycholog effect great might fear
 would be. forecast drastic chang mean
 last forecast; we're talk two-tenth percent overal gnp.
 certain amount arithmet momentum thi.
 don't
 view chang first half great chang.
 note last time, perceiv slow first half come
 two wai: either final demand weak produc
 react realli fast inventori build up;
 inventori would begin build we'd see adjust
 product process. sort got second [from the]
 emerg data; final sale fourth quarter somewhat
 disappoint. outcom, there's
 slightli differ stori.
 ms. seger. second question--mayb mr. truman-involv assumpt dollar. like
 year?
 agreement thought struck
 major nation call draw halt dollar's declin,
 suppos take serious forecast 10 percent declin
 weight-averag valu dollar year, follow [a

 mr. truman. well, it's littl less 10 percent,

 2/9-10/88
 
 ms. seger.

 mr. truman. ye, lot time

 present last chart middl panel it. you'd
 think somehow dollar realli problem, wai set

 dollar go go down, you're go get much
 
 differ [as mai seen] chart. [if] everybodi seem
 happi current account deficit, it, thei're
 probabl go less thought. look forward
 1989, might want easier monetari polici--that's
 chart design deal with--where stronger dollar

 mr. stern. i'd like go back question
 inventori distribut busi around world. assum
 there's go sort inventori cycl type
 forecast, even greater: sens

 slow product abroad domest--given we,
 cours, import lot us to?
 mr. prell. difficult question. sort
 data tri put finger mani
 dollar' worth import inventori overhang.
 least arithmet, appear present retail
 sector; doesn't amount lot dollar, best assess.
 it's probabl small proport would signific
 factor.
 mr. truman. give exampl, think on number

 therefor, go set mini-cycl rest

 mr. stern. well, side it, extent

 mr. prell. think domest industri, net,

 second-order factor.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid forrest.
 
 mr. forrest. go ask ted truman
 question governor seger rais respect real growth
 abroad.
 guess ted basic answer question,
 could take step further: sinc basic exportdriven forecast, countri like germani franc itali,
 particularli germani, respons
 overtur, fall short--i don't mean recess short
 growth pattern expect--is forecast seriou troubl?
 guess would add that, given weight trade japan
 canada, appar could carri lot it; wouldn't expect
 fall short.
 suppos countri did, would
 expect forecast come-mr. truman. well, wouldn't want suggest
 differ 2 percent growth zero wouldn't effect
 forecast.
 would someth order
 [unintellig].
 1 percent lower growth throughout

 that's rel
