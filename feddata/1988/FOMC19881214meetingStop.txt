 Would somebody like move minutes
 
 I'll it.

 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection approved.
 Mr. Cross, would bring us date foreign currency
 operations?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions Mr. Cross?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Could elaborate comments
 German mark--the view mark weak?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 didn't say thought weak.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. know. Chairman thinks it's weak,
 it's top snake, not?
 MR. CROSS. mark weakened course

 improving, Mr. Chairman. European entry factor element
 this, Germans increasing trade balance
 number European partners, EMS outside
 EMS. So, concern mark appear

 MR. FORRESTAL. Sam, reported morning
 perhaps market looking trade number around $10 $11
 billion. assessment looking for?
 MR. CROSS. Well, heard numbers anywhere $8-1/2
 $12-1/2 billion. Now, gets little confusing
 two bases calculating days, always sure
 people talking terms. general view seems
 trade deficit around $10 billion time.
 some--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 That's CIF, yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 That's seasonal adjustment?
 
 CIF, seasonal adjustment?
 
 Yes, CIF seasonally adjusted.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. So, anything $10 billion, you'd
 expect pressures dollar?
 MR. CROSS. Well, wouldn't jump big conclusions
 we've occasions number came well
 dollar moved down. believe market seen it's
 possible get hurt shorting dollar much. think
 trade figures certainly hanging market important
 way. think lot participants anxious much
 then.
 could good trade figure would provide
 little support, it's sure thing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. silly question, tell
 retract it.
 decide, intervene, whether
 really come like "gangbusters" make sort anemic effort?
 comments, sounded said earlier
 month market participants disappointed intervention--I'm
 paraphrasing--because looked trying let
 dollar easily weren't really trying hold up.

 really intend that?
 MR. CROSS.
 intention indeed got
 asked, press conference released quarterly report,
 whether trying smooth dollar, said weren't.
 trying that.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 So, didn't go really hit then?
 
 MR. CROSS. Well, one thing, unless you're really going
 intervene very, large amounts it's always crystal clear
 reaction going expenditure 'X' amount
 dollars.
 also work closely
 colleagues Treasury may may feel good
 idea intervene strongly particular time.
 And, also,
 precise amounts always, try coordinate efforts
 central banks give kind
 message. occasions period number people
 market thought efforts big enough really
 smack exchange rate decisive way.
 think
 period several weeks continued cumulative
 effect became noticeable important.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Mr. Cross?

 not, would somebody like move ratify transactions since
 November meeting?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Sternlight?
 
 MR. MELZER. Peter, what's market terms

 now, importantly borrowings figure that?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think realization

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, generally speak expectation

 think right along we've felt degree

 It's persistent

 MR. BLACK. Peter, fair say differences

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, came periods recent
 intermeeting interval deviations got sufficient
 concern funds rate moving far become
 think say period since

 November conference call, fair amount flexibility given
 letting funds rate move. started saying
 November call expected funds around 8-3/8 percent,
 seems largely market expectations brought

 MR. BLACK. Yes, [morning conference] call

 MR. KEEHN. Peter, commented 30-year

 [what] market reaction we've done far?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 think market expects probably
 we'll exercising restraint near term. Many people
 would expect see year-end, [unintelligible] maybe going
 early next year, funds would push higher, would
 additional restraint exercised strength economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's interesting question
 whether combine premium [forward] markets

 think clearly see

 not, would somebody move ratify

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. get

 MR. KOHN. That's probably right.

 MR. JOHNSON. think you're right.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 comments?
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. question. bad
 relationship get, unreliable, drop
 approach?
 MR. KOHN.
 
 don't know.
 
 MS. SEGER. So, Manley Johnson indicates, seems
 rule relationship hasn't super terrific
 rather exception last four years so.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. KOHN. That's question Committee answer.

 would say tend focus shifts; that's issue
 brought attention Committee discussions
 occur.
 It's clear don't long periods
 relationship sufficiently track get approximately
 money market conditions Committee thought getting
 specified borrowing objective. periodic shifts
 sure.
 can't answer Committee range
 tolerance is.
 think tried indicate closing remarks
 thought treating money market conditions
 borrowing flexibly, gotten could
 difficult period without key firmly specific federal
 funds rates getting locked narrow federal funds targeting
 retain basic borrowing objective. time,
 Mr. Sternlight sensitive potential funds rate
 getting way whack Committee expected. So,
 sort compromise worked view worked pretty
 well end.
 MS. SEGER. robot pushed
 $600 million kept going got it, would
 guess federal funds rate might gone?
 MR. KOHN.
 [Unintelligible].
 Bluebook
 indication alternative "C," $600 million, funds
 rate would getting toward 9 percent.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 don't think you'd go that?
 
 MR. PARRY. That's end-of-year adjustment well?
 mean, could even higher short term?
 MR. KOHN. could higher short periods time,
 that's right.
 think would settle down.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I've indicated lot times,
 hope going move eventually kind reserve
 targets make necessary institutional changes they'll work.
 think it's important interim recognize
 borrowed reserve target reserve target usual sense.
 real instrument current procedures, perceive it,
 federal funds rate determines demand
 money consequently rate growth aggregates.

 borrowing simply device use try control
 federal funds rate.
 think confused us, confused
 markets occasion.
 remember Manley arguing
 back March meeting think was.
 would favor
 adopting, could get consensus, wider range federal
 funds rate dropping borrowing target.
 would give
 Desk, consultation [Chairman Greenspan], enough freedom
 move anywhere within half percentage point limit [for federal
 funds rate] seems consistent directive.
 still favor
 that.
 think [recent intermeeting] period illustrated that.

 think Peter Sternlight handled beautifully way jumped back
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 one other. think time
 resolved favor federal funds rate
 differences. think that's important two.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. disturbances shifts seem larger
 terms magnitude recently, naturally raises concern
 look going forward. time period
 setting policy, think concerns President
 Black's--that confusing public about,
 certainly keep talking reserve restraint
 opposed fed funds rates. Somehow, think might clearer
 one other. flexibility, seems me, simply
 gives perception, least mind perhaps others,
 nothing following market rates making
 policy directly. is, simply support whatever market
 believes rates ought be. So, guess sense I'd happy
 cut one way formal agreement
 range borrowings. turns
 funds rate ought use, wider band,
 support position.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, think need step back
 narrow issue procedure procedure ask broader
 question policy itself. think last several years
 policy generally good. compare happened
 last several years went back last 20 years so,
 think general done done
 particular cycle. think borne life
 cycle fairly good control we've inflation.
 Now, issue is, procedure helpful us achieving
 goal? achieved good policy spite procedure?
 sense procedure helpful guiding us
 toward better policy. procedure perfect. think we've
 found that, whatever procedure we've used, always times
 override it. Manley Johnson's point correct
 point override much maybe ought
 look around. whole, looking broad picture, think
 procedure served us well made better policy.
 MR. JOHNSON. Actually, I'm suggesting would
 disapprove way Desk managed lately. think
 handled sensitivity--with sensitivity wouldn't mind
 seeing [in future].
 mean, concern always
 strict borrowing target.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. also think operations handled
 well period. general sense moving
 closer funds rate targeting regime, agree comments
 confusion create internally externally.
 think general--and believe reasons Ed Boehne
 implying without saying--that helped us define business,
 will, reserves interest rates [even though we]
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 characterize changes policy changes degree reserve
 
 restraint opposed changes target market interest
 rate.
 think that's helpful deflecting political pressures
 forth, continue move closer sense funds rate
 target feel ought explicit that.
 did,
 personally would feel strongly different proviso
 right now. effect, borrowed reserves regime
 targeting funds rate, proviso based
 
 funds rate really never operative. So, go
 explicitly that, I'd like see, times
 past kind proviso based reserve base, whether
 would given us kind balance think looking
 directive.
 guess, finally, might ask rhetorical question,
 part confusion:
 going describe what's
 happened intermeeting period mind degree
 reserve restraint measured borrowings target
 set? effect, saying really increased degree
 reserve restraint time borrowings target come
 down. think puts confusion perspective.
 describe degree reserve restraint terms balances
 funds rate, that's one thing. mind that's really
 "degree reserve restraint" meant. don't leave
 that? I'm sure that's easily answerable, think know
 it.
 MR. KOHN. We, course, added suggested addition
 paragraph policy record describing November 22 meeting,
 attempts reconcile two things.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, seems
 good enlightening paper one things
 sought uncover reasons lack borrowing
 think given plausible. One occurred
 changed discount rate often
 recently may perception market failure
 move often discount rate effect increase
 spread discount rate federal funds rate go
 forward therefore produce greater hesitancy part banks
 borrow discount window. Whatever reason,
 shortfall. I've thought this, strikes
 effect targeting federal funds rate; really that.
 think understand reasons don't want admit
 targeting funds rate. since periods
 instability seem greater periods stability, wonder
 time hasn't come really examine procedure perhaps
 confirm really targeting rate.
 wouldn't think period
 confusion market due computer failures
 end year. So, think need little
 evidence whether relationship come back
 acceptable level. think time really come us
 perhaps think seriously going pure funds targeting,
 1/8 percentage point degree precision attempted
 range federal funds rate targeting. Now, agree
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 what's said policy pretty good
 last couple years following current procedure, think
 policy results obtained basically
 flexibility exercised Desk rather procedure
 itself. So, rather continue produce memos this, talk
 time, think maybe time come examine
 carefully make decision early part 1989.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Well, it's interesting discussion
 years, I've always said analytically correct
 it's good agreeing that. there's
 important point think keep mind, there's
 important reason want target federal funds
 rate explicitly. discount rate announcement instrument.
 explicitly choose federal funds target change
 25 basis points, change 12-1/2 basis points 50 basis
 points, part open market operations becomes
 believe
 announcement target like discount rate is.
 it's [unintelligible] two kinds instruments, one instrument
 use that's subtle, that's quickly understood
 camouflage market forces work, another policy instrument
 So, would never
 that's clear announcement effect.
 favor going explicit federal funds targeting even though
 carries

 announcement effect would prefer. would

 talked time time total reserves [target]
 scheduled total reserves could give whatever elasticity
 choose. variant sometimes refer

 think ways
 cap sides.
 might explore without going explicit federal funds targeting.
 MR. BLACK. Wayne, wouldn't lot announcement effect
 lost since wouldn't released Friday following
 next Federal Open Market Committee meeting?
 MR. ANGELL. Well, give
 explicit 8-5/8 percent funds rate shoot
 range, change rate it's going
 market--as previously explicit
 used.
 
 Desk, let's say,
 within specified

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, one fact want throw

 words, you're going focus
 explicit funds rate announcement effect, you're going
 generally day one side throughout
 whole maintenance period you're going play

 think you're forced stay one side can't, even
 wanted to, calibrate funds rate target exactly.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, think even though it's certainly

 MR. BLACK.
 certainly wouldn't favor targeting particular

 indicated. would note band associated

 MR. BLACK. Yes, money supply spurted, made banks

 MR. ANGELL. Yes, could whatever elasticity

 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. want abandon current operating
 procedures shouldn't basis you're confusing

 Analytically, modified flexible federal funds rate
 So, seems
 approach, market knows that.
 discussion ought revolve around best procedure;
 is, whether something rigid far fed funds targeting
 appropriate--which wouldn't happy support--or
 whether reserves target. think confusion
 issue.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. might technical option,
 know,
 always thought possibility would be--.
 estimated borrowing function; go quite sophisticated
 analysis know econometric equation estimates long-term
 relationship funds rate borrowings, seems
 could basis establishing sort expected funds
 rate range.
 seems could still set borrowing
 target; however, funds rate start vary outside
 range predicted estimated long-term relationship,
 didn't really know why, ought sensitive
 funds rate versus trying hit borrowing number. would
 allow us pursue borrowing procedure sensitive
 funds rate get outside expected band.
 mean, that's
 money putting in--what Bob Black saying--but least
 there's scientific reasoning, rhyme, set
 expected range. think actually that's we've
 doing.
 MR. PARRY.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 going say, isn't did?
 think that's okay; I'm opposed it.
 
 MR. HELLER. wanted formalize that--I mean
 targets--in directive, wouldn't squeeze fed funds
 rate clause 50 basis points something like that?
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Well, don't know variants are.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -12-
 
 MR. KOHN. going say, terms standard
 deviation borrowing equation, federal funds band much
 larger we've tolerating. It's like 3/8ths
 percentage point.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Plus minus?
 
 MR. KOHN.
 [$100 million], plus minus terms standard
 deviations.
 right, Dave?
 MR. LINDSEY. Yes, that's $500 [million].
 Judgmentally,
 Desk come closer that, doesn't [unintelligible]
 equation.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, something like that; ought least
 look standard deviation see that's within
 tolerance.
 MR. BLACK. One thing probably agree we've
 pretty darn good job we've had; it's
 question whether continue procedure.
 MR. STERN. Well, agree who've observed
 significant distance away even pure federal funds
 rate targeting guess would prefer keep distance
 targeting.
 see couple reasons that. One
 extent grass always greener phenomenon. Every time problem
 crops we'd like find better way would too.

 hunch search going turn long arduous.
 Equally important, know pretty much committed
 federal funds rate 1970s.
 wouldn't attribute
 problems policy 1970s federal funds rate target,
 wouldn't say helpful either. Based
 historical experience, I'd cautious going back
 something like that. Now, may find different way implementing
 closer control funds rate that's want do.

 think despite problems current procedure,
 history 1970s doesn't make sanguine tighter control
 federal funds rate.
 MR. PARRY. But, Gary, isn't rigid fed
 funds target?
 something flexible,
 seems worked least period.
 MR. STERN. I'm complaining current procedures,
 said, it's long way away pure targeting funds rate.
 MR. BLACK. advocating
 much wider band.
 would totally opposed going
 back before.
 market-MR. STERN. guess wonder setting
 adjust band, day-to-day within it.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 isn't risk
 band implicitly getting narrower heading back
 toward 1970s?
 something like Bob Black wants
 do, maybe Tom Melzer would tie probably base--
 
 -13-
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. JOHNSON. know reality point, long
 move point enough--that's Bob saying. could
 explicit funds rate target, moved often enough
 whole issue really whether you're
 deal problem--.
 
 willing move funds rate. guess Gary saying
 1970s body explicit funds rate targeting,
 always
 reason wasn't willing move funds rate enough.
 behind. think question is, went back that, would
 
 willing move funds rate often?
 whether would not.
 
 issue really
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, there's little
 willingness people it. goes Wayne's point,
 movement funds rate much announcement
 effect. current procedure allow flexibility absent
 announcement effect.
 MR. JOHNSON. True, tend agree Bob Parry:
 market knows exactly; scrutinize funds rate hourly.
 

 
 MR BOEHNE. That's true, except market totally
 logical it, half point increase discount rate ought
 equal 50 basis point increase funds rate,
 isn't.
 MR. JOHNSON. see certain announcement
 effects similar announcement effects change
 discount rate. think that's discount rate change
 viewed intention Fed lock funds rate
 level put floor it. So, think that's
 effect--of considered Fed decision make funds rate
 permanent rate it's going flexible down.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Temporarily.
 
 Temporarily.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Well, it's clear markets
 know are. think markets pick rate
 think at, allow move rate;
 that's way read what's going on. figure are;
 keep trading rate certain way; don't protest
 sufficiently, finally decide, nothing bad happens, let
 rate go market sets it. seems way
 we've operating, don't find exactly comfortable way
 setting policy. think ought react markets,
 ought understand trying tell you.
 MR. PARRY. Well, turn around little. go
 intermeeting period, things look like
 firming good analytic reasons, allow firm
 little bit, what's wrong that? didn't, you'd going
 back 1970s Gary referred to.
 MR. HOSKINS. don't understand it. conditional
 directive, conditions work rates go up,
 market it, what?

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. little complicated
 that. Bob Heller, taking point regarding problems

 virtually every central bank major country one way another

 simply inability Committee committee move
 interest rate target enough. think there's
 least think major league questions
 economics relationship interest rate target
 money target things. again, think Gary made good
 point; there's tendency think, gee, we'll try
 problems going go away; quite contrary, won't.
 whole new bushel basket full problems. guess
 it's partly spirit [that find ourselves] today.
 Going back Ed Boehne's comments, actually think
 procedure worked pretty darn well.
 think Governor
 Johnson made point anything probably gotten
 bit flexible, maybe lot flexible, that's right
 me, too. great advantage
 cited Governor Angell, Ed, Gary others
 current procedures valuable form give it;
 breathes; it's rigid.
 think character
 awfully good market point view, think it's awfully
 good point view. think ways
 distinguishes extreme form federal funds rate target.
 It's extreme form involves question inertia,
 think inevitably put slippery slope regime
 fine tuning would find very, difficult support.
 So,
 kind like think we've got flexible
 
 -15-
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 need be.
 think demonstrated capacity
 flexibility brought bear either small things,
 Peter Chairman Greenspan it, big things done
 Committee. sure wouldn't want change
 much.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let suggest couple things
 think involved last year haven't
 really raised today. One question think implicit
 whether move incremental fashion discontinuous jumps.
 is:
 know degree pressure right wrong,
 know whether moving fast enough?
 think
 implicitly coming grips questions--granted
 fundamental purpose inflation front granted
 felt inadequate respect money supply targets--we really
 looking essentially slope interest rates.
 One
 reasons guess members Committee felt
 comfortable degree incremental tightening
 involved essentially stabilizing
 inflation expectations around rather narrow range.

 extraordinary value basic purpose
 prevent breakout inflation upside. think fact
 looking stable long-term interest rate
 given us policy anchor suspect going exist
 indefinitely either next cycle think
 special case turned exceptionally helpful.
 think useful enabled us function
 rather systematic way. thing concerns
 next cycle that's unlikely exist.
 don't think there's anything
 
 involved part pure luck.
 remember prior discount rate increase 1987,
 summer year historical appraisal extent
 short-term tightening either moved long-term rates
 pretty convincing historical result short-term
 rates moved result Federal Reserve tightening, long-term
 rates moved up. Now, one argue may well
 largely expectational factor; is, you're moving
 incrementally, next expectation move create
 much higher long-term interest rate. think that,
 evaluating current theory, turned rather well; and,
 
 think also procedure worked well suspect it's
 fact we've long-term interest rate anchor.
 I'm little concerned may overread usefulness
 generic tool times places. would inclined
 come side unless feel
 
 comfortable specific procedures would involved
 reserve targeting money supply targeting, probably best
 suited develop cycle period something
 concensus Committee feels comfortable operational
 
 vehicle without taking seriously there's something
 sacrosanct particular function itself.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 kind happened,
 
 course, look sweep 30 years.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 Yes, I'm sure that's wrong.
 
 -16-
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. GUFFEY. don't think add anything hasn't
 already said state position. would oppose
 moving back rigid federal funds rate target.
 think
 happened last two intermeeting periods particularly
 proven worth procedures we've following. I'd also
 note nothing new apparently world
 idea broadening federal funds range letting market move
 within range rather us regime followed
 10 years ago called area federal funds
 rate could move "zone indifference."
 don't know
 whether published term not, certainly
 featured discussions around table. zone indifference
 would set within federal funds rate range 2 3
 percentage points, action would taken long fed
 funds rate moved within zone. recollection, Bob Black may
 remember, zone indifference one full
 percentage point. point done before.

 wasn't successful might add, one reasons
 would hate go back rigid federal funds target even
 type caveat.
 MR. JOHNSON. I'd say rigid right now,
 even full borrowing target, even we'd within that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER.
 couple comments wanted add.
 Jerry said one them, econometrics aren't
 really tie funds rate goals, think
 important point.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 economics worry me.
 
 It's econometrics;
 
 MR. MELZER. secondly, nobody's really said
 explicitly, think Gary alluded it, funds rate
 procyclical target; that's feel rather strongly
 explicitly use target, need kind proviso
 reserve-based.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think we've always multiple
 provisos.
 can't see us ever functioning [unintelligible].
 President Keehn.
 MR. KEEHN. Well, completely agree procedure
 describe it, question would
 explain markets doing. mind
 February Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. something different
 you're going explain testimony?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. we've
 doing, whether defined not, least long I've
 here.
 don't know difference explain.
 MR. KEEHN. Well, would think testimony
 aggregate discussion tends heavy side terms ranges
 performance relative ranges, etc.
 
 12/13-14/88

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 sense.
 
 MR. KEEHN.
 think talking quite
 different procedure agree.
 think may
 responsibility explain Congress well
 
 markets something little bit different here.

 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. hand, we've stayed within
 [monetary] target ranges defined Congress--
 
 right middle--and it's likely don't anything
 explain.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 course, explanation isn't difficult.
 
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 accident, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid misstated
 position pretty badly.
 think excellent memo last time
 
 demonstrates pretty clearly good relationship
 long run M2 price level. think price level
 ought ultimate target. think that's really ought
 targeting on. that, think things
 fall place well can. suggests
 somehow control supply money.
 short run, talking now, procedures
 regardless whether use borrowed reserve target federal
 funds rate [range is] narrower wider--and mind
 wider one--necessitate able estimate short-run demand
 money. think that's difficult do. attempting
 say think leave borrowed reserves stuff
 work federal funds rate, we'll probably better
 short run that. satisfied get
 point really pay lot attention long run
 what's happening M2, variable better
 predictor rate inflation that's way want move.
 certainly don't mind rigid pegging federal funds
 rate. would nothing modern day version
 real bills doctrine market would get everything wanted
 way money particular rate chose could
 change would raise rate lower it--which means
 we'll end real bills doctrine, I'm violently opposed
 that. think doctrine long since discredited.
 question really kind mechanism short run get

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, say that.
 struck discussion something aware
 previously. sense even though different
 views way monetary system functions various
 preferences, strong feeling unease within
 Committee current procedures. guess, "if ain't broke
 don't fix it."
 means guess proceed

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. softening new orders

 interesting question whether temporary slowdown

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, may remember way construct

 staff forecast wrong, export orders wrong.
 Essentially, division domestic orders exports orders

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, that's quite true, backlog

 fully constructed National Association Purchasing

 MR. TRUMAN. That's said seems
 although data may well used think there's going

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Perhaps would best first
 directed questions Mr. Truman go back domestic
 market issues Mr. Prell. don't stay
 international side question Mr. Truman stage. Let
 raise one question.
 forecast, implication
 fairly significant slowing adjustment process.
 It's
 dimension suggests it's got month two
 poor numbers, going create usual concerns.

 would assume type environment market
 probably moving exchange rates forecast.
 don't
 know whether that's sort implicitly assumed forecast
 process, whether forecasts exchange rate
 essentially straight lined calculate there,
 whether try get little dynamic it.
 MR. TRUMAN. answer last part question
 find hard enough try come "forecasts"
 exchange rate don't try put dynamic in.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 one else seems to!
 
 don't know difficulty.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. think risk that, since
 staff forecast trade balance improvement essentially levels
 1989. extent exaggerated impact somewhat
 higher oil prices come in.
 So, there's little bit
 improvement ex-oil forecast. market presumably look
 part forecast total numbers.
 think mentioned Greenbook, strike
 wanted fine tune things might feel stalling,
 want put way, partial stalling process could
 lead pressures exchange markets short run
 markets adjust that.
 Factors behind essentially two.
 One
 strength dollar year fact
 that, least forecast, slowing growth abroad
 1989 give us less [impetus?] standpoint.

 1990, forecast gains essentially cumulative effects
 relatively small appreciation dollar that's forecast
 slowdown U.S. demand.
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -21-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. reason raised issue
 looking [potential] shock remarkably smooth
 econometric forecast Greenbook, course necessity
 always good. strikes area get
 destabilization something cracking seams.
 curious get sense order magnitude
 would problem. words, assume anything
 happen, looking at, say, 10 yen adjustment distinct
 25 yen.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, guess, would guess
 way. think would also depend else going
 time. slowdown trade adjustment
 progress--whatever means--or perceptible progress budget
 deficit, might strengthen dollar. U.S. economy seems
 slowing bit, might also tend offset
 effects adjustment somewhat disappointing trade numbers.
 think lot depends else going time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. One thing bothered little
 forecast combining international side domestic side
 that--I understand point slowing trade
 adjustment expectation dollar depreciation--but I'm
 little trouble understanding that's consistent
 interest rate projections forecast. We've gotten
 before, talking fairly substantial increase
 short-term interest rates next year year half,
 yet dollar depreciation. question would don't
 see quite consistent, unless you're arguing foreign
 counterparts move interest rates parallel fashion. So,
 wonder kind assumption you've got there.
 MR. TRUMAN. particular point, increase
 rates abroad, order magnitude--maybe half
 little bit less half increase U.S.
 interest rate differentials moving favor dollar.
 know, think area [a question of?]
 much enough, want put way. think it's matter
 science doesn't provide us much guidance. One reason
 tended forecast slow rate depreciation dollar
 relative overall contour previous Greenbook
 fact recognition somewhat higher rates interest
 occur forecast, least short end
 kind stuff long end, tend damp tendency
 dollar depreciate; depreciation would argue would much
 larger absence that. effect forecast.
 question whether calibrated right. would
 argue, know, forecast like interest rates would
 bring even way stability dollar
 have.
 [unintelligible]
 MR. JOHNSON. understand scenario foreign rates
 keeping U.S. rates, guess next question would
 that's case, doubts
 exchange rate scenario Greenbook. case,
 going ask built foreign demand?
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -22-
 
 MR. TRUMAN. fairly sharp decline rate
 increase demand abroad--down something like 2-1/2 percent
 somewhat 3 percent rate average G-10 countries
 year. one factor affecting things way. Now,
 think two scenarios. scenario 1988
 relative increase U.S. interest rates balance
 year approximate dollar stability. hand, also
 1987, relative increase U.S. interest rates
 fairly sharp dollar decline period.
 So, don't think
 science, put way, [unintelligible].
 MR. JOHNSON. think part reason 1987
 decline rates moving sharply abroad
 here.
 MR. TRUMAN. No, relative increase U.S.
 interest rates period. issue think really
 market sense expects equilibrium
 external accounts is, looking long run. don't think
 there's strong--; views map, saying
 current account go zero ones say live
 current account $100 billion so.
 guess driven
 staff forecast exchange rates number years
 view it's going one way other--that
 current account necessarily go zero
 going deficit $100 billion, strikes us fairly
 big number finance, forth on.
 think
 issue tradeoff much comes price
 effects much comes income effects, extent
 somewhat higher interest rates country work
 sort underlying forces tending drive
 adjustment price effects. best provide
 rough thinking matter without lot precision,
 don't think there's lot precision here. Now, basically
 built forecast 6 percent decline dollar
 roughly today annual rate.
 translates
 somewhat less 4 percent real terms. That's relatively
 modest decline standards recent years. rationale
 modest decline fact U.S. interest rates
 moving higher. may you'll get another 1988 1989

 whatever want call them, you're going get somewhat

 Vice Chairman
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 I'll take side
 
 minute. look 1990, think 'Catch-22'
 even sharper following sense.
 difficult stipulate set conditions involving stable exchange
 rate current levels, rather modest decline combination
 relative U.S. foreign economic growth. would yield
 situation external adjustment stops,
 reverses end 1990. don't necessarily believe that,
 went conventional exercise using conventional,
 historical, estimates various elasticities, on, it's
 implausible.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 [unintelligible].
 
 That's IMF OECD
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. It's implausible end
 result which, said, second half 1990
 current account trade account deficits actually
 increasing. great deal difficulty accepting view
 variety reasons, really want Catch-22
 contemplate, that's it.
 MR. TRUMAN. It's difficult run forecasts
 different assumptions, based conversation
 weekend, run forecast nothing changed except
 exchange rate path. Now, may ask get
 exchange rate change, also ask get nothing changing

 Well, said--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 academics come exactly

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 gets pretty ugly.
 
 question
 
 [unintelligible] get elsewhere.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 right.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. think it's likely
 trade balance really compatible inflation goals.
 would surprise left fairly large trade
 deficit things need keep inflation down.
 means there's big structural problem that's really
 case. big savings-investment imbalance worldwide
 that's basically it.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'll put graphic
 terms. Marty Feldstein right, would ultimately happen
 circumstances even relatively high [interest
 rates, there] would major possibly highly disruptive fall
 bed exchange rates.
 MR. JOHNSON. don't want focus dollar entirely,
 conditions get that--; don't think
 running large trade deficit going
 maintain policy keeps inflation down. side
 trade numbers aren't going improve either.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, maybe might emphasize one basic
 rationales much forecast, view
 Committee's view wants inflation.
 Now, also true we've done modest exchange rate
 change degree continuing progress--as result
 real exchange rate change--in trade current accounts,
 obviously. Now, could change equation little bit
 didn't exchange rate change, it's also true
 sense you'd favorable inflation outlook
 period wouldn't quite kind [inflationary]
 pressure coming new exchange rate change forecast
 period. sense, connection two parts
 forecast. Whether got balance right either domestic
 side domestic-external side think need humble about.
 exchange rate change itself--the one that's built
 here--does bring you, want put way,
 improvement external side runaway inflation. So,
 sense you're bumping capacity constraints. That's partly
 rest economy squeezed extent
 allow external economy adjustment continue.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, may possible financeable
 current account it's consistent keeping inflation rate
 level. I'm saying that's possible, I'm saying that's
 close call. don't know anybody that's saying get balance
 short period that's consistent that.

 agree it's possible. Central banks finance whole thing

 It's consistent lot

 earlier. But, actually, look total adjustment

 depends happens abroad.
 
 Yes, that's true.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, think one distinguish
 running recession, doesn't really buy much
 come recession [at lower] level income later
 come back level income before, you've bought
 us lower financial cost imports interval. would
 think case essentially case that's implicit
 forecast here, slowdown growth essentially
 device consistent slowing rate growth
 something like 3/4 1 percentage point think growth
 potential something consistent growth potential,
 is, think
 meantime dipping [potential].
 different, get something essentially percentage
 point, little bit more, lower growth
 economy running along 1/2 percent [higher] growth.
 MS. SEGER. wasn't talking comparing recession
 now, I'm saying comparing slow growth forecast
 honest-to-goodness resession.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, honest-to-goodness recession would help
 short run. think come recession
 get back start from, it's clear terms
 external accounts really bought
 much. want prolong recession extended

 MR. PRELL. Well, shocks, want call

 So, would

 MR. PRELL. guess questioning interpretation

 Basically, we've seen substantial acceleration compensation

 alternative years, you're quite correct fundamentally

 reasons alternative forecasts got presented diminishing

 Now, find actually looking back experience

 I'm right line, going 1.4 million year 1.43
 1.36 million 1990 fairly significant amount

 different scenarios before, housing one
 interest-sensitive industries therefore one would respond
 dramatically tightening. So, looked these, really
 wondered enough decline; looking another way,
 wondered, interest rates stay now,
 housing starts would rise?
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. PRELL. No, don't think so. certainly
 1.55 million housing start level saw recent month's

 given assumption mortgage rates rising

 industries, think Chairman mentioned
 earlier, notably steel, use labor saving equipment

 Looking national economy, outlook considerably

 little surprised disagree Greenbook forecast

 also think spending nonresidential structures

 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, Eleventh District think

 little optimism we've past. outside

 factor, apparent stabilization energy prices--or least
 lesser likelihood precipitous decline--bodes well
 part country, although inflation side people might
 wonder little. dichotomy kind shows manufacturing,
 industries related foreign trade well,
 activities related energy construction
 well. Also, agricultural side, livestock producers going
 squeezed somewhat higher drought-related feed
 costs, yet farmers cash crops pretty well.
 think employment growth three District states

 long lead times allocations beginning ease somewhat.
 Indeed, orders communications equipment electronic components

 always good. found one particularly helpful although
 make darn nervous inflation side suggests
 there's little room error. projects
 tightening policy period appreciable rise
 interest rates, doesn't cause underlying rate
 inflation diminish much, well 1990
 So, seems risk error
 decline modest best.
 really probably going inflation
 staff Greenbook fact risk error
 this.
 Wage pressures, several people indicated,
 increasing--not rapidly cases--but certainly unmistakably;
 consumer prices increase rate 4-1/2 5 percent
 projecting next year, seems it's almost
 inevitable begin see wage pressures then.
 So,
 would surprised, absence action part,
 see, rather declining inflation 1990, wage-price spiral
 feeding other.
 

 expected wage pressures elsewhere considerably
 stronger people seem anticipate.
 Now, real side economy, guess
 first part next year anyway despite signs rapid upward
 pace foreign economies may slowing extent,
 still going perhaps little restraint
 export demand staff suggested. growth
 employment income domestic economy
 suggests probably domestic spending also going

 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. great

 Agriculture, example, strong. There's smile

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 I've somewhat surprised slower
 MR. ANGELL.
 money growth hasn't shown auction markets, foreign
 exchange particularly commodity markets. M2 last
 four weeks 24 months previously grown believe 4.7
 percent rate slowest growth rate 24-month period
 I'm somewhat surprised hasn't shown
 since 1961.
 auction makets, foreign exchange particularly commodity
 markets.
 seems clearly upward shocks
 commodity prices, due rapid money
 growth took place 1985 1986, suppose recent

 matter commodity prices plateaued;
 ups downs retrenchment

 question whether maintain posture profit

 getting cost reductions economic efficiencies use
 new capital new techniques, whether
 higher commodity prices yet passed seems
 entire consumer-price structure going maintained
 So, seems
 level long enough takes place.
 given fact inventories position yet

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Partly meeting cycles

 conjure least mind worst fears matter
 fact. Insofar outlook concerned, think
 illustrative look Board staff's forecast versus New York
 staff's forecast I've mentioned end next
 year respective forecasts difference inflation

 very, dramatic difference. usual, Mike Prell touched
 critical point concerning result, outcome, yesterday
 said process putting forecast together
 continuing resist temptation build price
 forecast types behavior results might come
 historical experience. indeed look New York
 staff's forecast versus Board staff's forecast
 Board staff's forecast end next year rather

 case New York forecast, positive spread
 unit labor costs deflator. least arithmetic
 way, produces sharp difference net result
 inflation end period. rather significant
 buildup rate increase compensation per annum.
 think eyes people forecasts New York,
 essentially implicitly saying overall
 economic conditions, market conditions,
 still maintain least small, positive spread
 two variables. hunch, pick point, try
 avoid doing, guess I'd pick point somewhere staff
 forecast staff forecast New York. see it,
 risks, said before, really asymmetric.
 ask myself, Mike right--Mike collective Board
 staff--I'd say that's pretty good; it's ideal he's got
 things forecast give little chill,
 certainly I'd say "terrific." say myself, New
 York staff right? I'd say, holy mackerel, we've really got
 trouble, big trouble. It's sense think risks
 really quite asymmetric.
 Now, like lot people, juncture continue
 draw consolation talking yesterday things
 like long bond rate telling us. Again, that's probably one
 reasons would inclined split difference
 two forecasts. would tend pretty cautious even
 that. reminded last night, think

 Certainly, economy continues strong. I've got

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. I've sitting listening, trying
 match comments read Beigebook. Either
 weeks passed else read Beigebook wrong.

 sounds though views expressed quite different; namely,
 views today much optimistic presented
 observations. Also, maybe Mr. Hoskins help this,
 seems NABE runs periodic surveys members, seems
 roughly half members expect recession time next
 year. remaining respondents expect one 1990.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 don't numbers, think
 majority expect recession within next two years.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 47 percent next year.
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 course, two-thirds expected one 1988.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 tend roll things forward.
 
 MS. SEGER. read I'm trying ask
 know don't know assuming
 assuming. Again, talking business economists, think
 somewhat pessimistic consumer side staff
 forecast. housing area, least, think
 might little pessimistic. number bringing
 stories real estate problems, even Northeast.
 think
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -49-
 
 banks Northeast actually indicating
 going take losses real estate loans
 quite change people telling us months
 ago. think also true parts country
 extremely well turning around
 little bit. can't imagine that's environment
 developers going hustle start condo projects
 apartment buildings, etc. Also, capital spending arena
 reports pick up--computer chips, sorts companies-it seems situation changed dramatically last
 months. fact, cases they've gone shortage
 chips situations almost excess. Also, auto
 economists know little pessimistic inventory
 situation I've heard expressed around table today.
 fact, heard yesterday days-supply one large
 auto companies would little 100 end January.
 That's high. Also, get kind inventory situation
 autos, see follow production cutbacks.
 used incentives tremendous extent know,
 "bang buck" incentives seems petering out. So,
 come one side other, would think would
 fix production changes rather trying
 incentives.
 Also, export area I'm sure business
 economists I've spoken contacts I've made expect
 strength exports great. would certainly like
 get it, real confidence continue
 make tremendous advances have. Also, area
 inflation price stability, etc., one things think
 econometric models haven't picked haven't captured
 changed situation real world, particularly
 manufacturing. mean changes going on, emphasis
 efficiency, productivity, cost controls, knocking layers
 management, etc., think going last couple
 years think still going on. frankly look
 relationships back 10 15 years,
 different America then. think we've learned something can't
 imagine improved attitudes going suddenly
 evaporate. Also, think labor side people
 would rather employed $17 hour unemployed $18.25.
 Ask friend building trades much commercial
 building done non-union workers. Maybe that's
 impact fact unions haven't nice settlements
 used drool over. They, too, may pay attention
 markets, Bob. shock union people.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 think have.
 
 MS. SEGER. seems going on, particularly
 construction isn't rocketing ahead, would say bargaining
 power management might even stronger couple
 years ago. also, looking sources higher
 prices seen, I'm sure able control them.
 example, looking copper prices, supposed
 strike place? going go pull
 people back out? mean, influenced copper prices.
 Wayne's farmer friends certainly suffered bad weather
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 -50-
 
 conditions year, certainly put upward pressure
 prices agriculture commodities. don't know supposed
 it.
 also, looking prices steel
 products, seems influenced silly
 quotas we've put imports steel.
 So, maybe need
 help pals street fix things.
 Now, think Federal Reserve ought job.

 know Roger Guffey says everyone looking us it. Maybe
 ought tell can't solve problems, though
 share certainly. Picking one Governor LaWare's
 comments, think problems thrift area very,
 severe. met Monday person

 think pretty expert thrifts
 negative things say thrifts.
 indicated even building cost
 funds existing level short-term interest rates would
 tremendous damage, doesn't feed immediately.
 CDs fixed maturities takes existing
 levels influence those. He's crackpot subject,
 took comments rather seriously. also LDCs, think
 something really could give us banks
 involved things even bigger headaches. So,
 think it's difficult call.
 personal conclusion
 would it's certain 1989 1990 would excessively
 strong even without 200 basis point advance interest rates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 I'd generally like associate
 Governor LaWare Governor Kelley said.
 think everybody made
 lot useful comments, captured lot wanted
 say.
 think generally economy reasonably strong,
 little stronger probably would expected stage
 well.
 we've acknowledged see signs slowing
 think that's probably works fairly high level.
 think we've done good job establishing credibility
 monetary policy period. say think
 illustrated way financial markets behaved longterm rates remaining stable even showing signs declining.
 Commodity prices, high levels, plateaued
 trended peaks take together.
 dollar relatively stable except one speculative
 period elections, think it's still 5 6
 percent started year.
 So, general think we've
 pursued credible policy haven't behind curve, although
 agree John LaWare said--that part see
 financial markets credibility that's based expect
 us do.
 think want maintain degree
 confidence financial markets see right now,
 tightening probably necessary. I'm opposed that,
 think it's important consider speed undertake
 tightening actions. enough credible

 Whether Japan follows not, don't know. move

 It's going feed back

 So, taking

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. Almost everything said, Mr. Chairman.
 Let make three points briefly. First all, think we've got
 seen 1/2
 continue make progress inflation front.
 percent increase wages 3/4 percent increase total
 compensation. unacceptable lead exactly Bob
 Eisenmenger saying happening 1970s, continuation
 slow upward creep inflation. find troublesome
 tightening policy, particular, ill effect investment;

 staff forecast 0 1 percent growth investment 1990.
 worried capacity constraints things sort,
 certainly going building additional capacity
 environment. makes feel little better tightening
 think lot unexploited potential export
 area. lot American manufacturers really yet focusing
 all.
 I'm bit optimistic staff forecast
 far continuation export growth concerned going exchange
 rates.
 lot speakers mentioned aware
 fragility financial system. think that's certainly
 important point. would say can't design monetary policy
 avoid difficulties various sectors.
 first place,
 we've got focus inflation something goes wrong
 address problems much manner
 addressed past--for instance, stock market crash
 last year, quick adjustment policy. So, I'm also
 favor tightening policy. case feel good

 I'm much agreement
 that.
 Now, far

 MR. HELLER. Thank this--one small step time.
 discount rate versus tightening raising level borrowing:
 think agree announcement effect right

 become larger
 tighten, market clamor continue
 discount move finally going happen. So, won't get
 particular psychological hurdle; still hanging
 behind us.
 So, sum up, probably would go discount rate

 ask question something several people suggested already

 MR. KOHN. Peter may another view, reading

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 agree completely Chairman's
 scenario. That's one mind came
 meeting. think it's certainly worth discussing discount rate,
 maybe convinced, still feel best option
 one Chairman outlined.
 part, think move
 discount rate, run risk seeming part
 coordinated world-wide upward ratchet rates
 already expressed concern. also little concern
 [new rate] considered sort peak [in rates]--I
 realize may case lot you--but
 expected, given yield curve, really made final
 move next move lower rates, think that's going
 put pressure dollar. Moreover, don't think it's bad
 idea leave discount rate hanging peoples' mind means
 support dollar. so, see scenario Chairman
 painted best one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. saved policy comments now,
 discovered end discussion may

 one hasn't commented policy. view, basically, I'm
 concerned inflation. think it's high think
 probably go somewhat higher coming year, don't disagree
 view. also feel, given restraint we've
 exercised last two years general, inflation
 take comfort what's going
 going get away us.
 long bond yields, people mentioned. think
 put inflation longer-term perspective sense
 say extent seeds inflation looking
 sown 1985 1986 12 - 15 percent growth
 rates money. think attempt wring once-and consistent views expressed
 here--to try deal aggressively going take
 us track mentioned last meeting really making
 long-term progress inflation front. take reserve
 aggregate base view expressing earlier terms
 real interest rates, think course we've particularly
 last 6 months last 3 months, particularly
 we've virtually reserve growth, incremental tightening least
 viewed perspective could lead negative reserve growth
 going hit economy lot harder people may
 appreciate.
 So, I'm saying general I've quite
 satisfied course we've on, wouldn't advocate
 substantial additional tightening time. would certainly
 build effect discounted
 words, would definitely support
 market.
 position degree reserve restraint, however defined, would
 result funds rate somewhere around 8-1/2 8-5/8 percent
 time. wouldn't object steps might lead
 modestly higher. basically I've satisfied degree
 restraint and, think Bob Heller said right, primary concern
 inflation. So, I'm reacting might set
 area area [of economy] ought worry
 hold us back. really worry

 harder. coming difficult period. think everybody appreciates 1980s maybe experience

 So, implicitly would favor

 discount rate increase time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think increase $100
 million borrowing woefully inadequate.
 seems
 we've spent two days talking projections economy
 come conclusion; is, actual inflation
 rates stand good chance rising next year; underlying
 inflationary pressures building; economy,
 anything, surprising us upside.
 think move
 1/8 percent federal funds rate nothing all.
 seems bare minimum would alternative "C".

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suggestion table
 effectively [result] early January-MR. PARRY. think asked

 Well, "C-"
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Alternative "gong."
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 "C-"
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's "C-".

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think we've learned
 anything morning, it's don't live riskless society
 riskless world. think central question us--and
 it's going continue confront us risks continue--is
 whether risks constrain inhibit monetary
 policy.
 come feeling Governor Heller expressed earlier
 constrained absence emergency
 deal time. Like you, Mr. Chairman, think
 risks recession fairly slight.
 think faced

 much hoped. economy growing rate
 potential, think job us contain inflation
 slow economy down. Now, think danger
 don't enough time send signal market
 confirm credibility already have.
 implementing
 kind strategy, preference would discount rate increase.
 action Board, certainly think
 need move open market operations.
 Moving $100 million
 $100 million January would acceptable don't
 feel time differential great.
 think need move direction. So, would support
 prescription.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 -57-
 
 12/13-14/88
 
 MR. BOEHNE. think prescription right target.
 think appropriately balances need balance. think
 open market operations much preferable discount rate;
 discount rate hike would much point. So, agree
 you. I'd like comment business discount rate
 spread funds rate. classic
 reason given adjusting discount rate. think, given
 technique use operate open market operations
 borrowing, simply live ever widening spreads
 unless want raise discount rate time want
 ease open market operations. think sends conflicting signals.
 extent widening spread raise expectations
 increase discount rate, think ought away that.
 might well, Mr. Chairman, appropriate time either
 speech testimony simply indicate spread longer
 means terms considerations whether change
 discount rate not. point view, reason change
 discount rate today's world want announcement

 step back everything, one never liberty

 absolutely ideal policy would combination discount

 would mean federal funds rates would end somewhere
 north side 9 percent rather south side 9 percent.
 Then, I'd bring back little bit ideal start

 may surprise people--I probably would leave discount rate

 curve one. Certainly, time think
 tightening appropriate. scenario outlined
 right. would raise discount rate now. would simply raise

 right middle Christmas selling season.
 want announcement effect, can't think worse time unless
 really want cause retail sales go tailspin time
 many merchants, third, 40 percent annual sales take

 it's needed. monetary aggregate growth think looked pretty
 good, pretty responsible. Si Keehn said we've number
 tightening moves since last spring. I'm convinced we've
 seen impact economy yet. So, said, I'm Tom
 Melzer's side.

 think market expected discount rate increase, think
 don't get one might interpreted lessening

 there's also lot substance point Governor Angell made
 concerned lack firm relationship
 level borrowed reserves federal funds rate, think
 would exacerbated letting [rate spread widen] still
 further. time want reasonable this,
 see merits you've said. certainly see
 merits Tom Melzer said aggregates concern
 great deal. would willing go far didn't
 see sign beginning move. would like bargain
 little bit $100 million make little higher
 that. don't think it's important enough difference
 I'd want go mat anything sort. I'd really
 like discount rate part it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, fully support suggestion.
 would add listened comments around
 table gong-ringing possibility, expressed
 merely matter timing. may well indeed need ring
 gong. don't think need now, think
 least possibility may need ring all.
 So, would like possibility table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, position would move
 discount rate. think would much preferable way

 "C".
 
 Board doesn't see way, certainly alternative
 I'd move pretty fast borrowing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, came meeting
 preferred "B-C", someplace two.

 problem proposal you've laid table
 exception potential need second $100 million sometime
 early January. becomes evident that's appropriate
 move, think Board look use
 discount rate time rather today. I'd hold
 abeyance. may find helpful supporting dollar
 turn year.
 would want
 already mentioned least it's impression rates
 around world probably going increase, wouldn't want
 us leader parade. So, would hope could
 accept proposal laid table, $100 million now,
 careful look whether second $100 million
 whether discount rate increase sometime January.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could ask clarification?
 $100 million, would anticipate would move federal
 funds rate 8-7/8 initially 8-5/8 percent?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 first $100 million?
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think it's 8-5/8 8-3/4 percent;
 second $100 million 8-7/8 9 percent.
 

 
 MR. PARRY. Bluebook alternatives posed terms
 8-3/8 percent alternative "B," correct?
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 8-3/8 8-1/2 percent.
 Okay, you're adding 1/8 that.
 
 MR. KOHN. Well, adding 1/4 $100 million
 1/2 $200 million.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. aware coming
 year-end period seasonal factors could add something
 first 1/4.
 MR. HOSKINS. Well, one clarification. proposal
 to.do $100 million take look whether need
 another $100 million?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let clarify later.
 think
 get around everybody wants talk. Bob Eisenmenger, don't
 think indicated preference, want give one.
 MR. EISENMENGER Well, think would prefer move
 little faster proposed, it's mild preference.

 far discount rate concerned, determination
 Board anyway. might wish it, immediately--do
 toward end year.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Roger Guffey captured
 best done [consensus] stipulated
 various members Committee.
 would propose go
 immediately $100 million asymmetric language,
 understanding unless something significant
 perceived occurs go second $200 million January.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Second $100 million.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 beg pardon; meant say
 second $100 million January. Board Governors
 time decide move discount rate,
 would telephone conference call readjust borrowing
 requirements calibrate context either fully
 offsetting $100 million, $200 million, perhaps one
