 vice chairman solomon. come back governor wallich's
 point:
 forecast project higher rate inflat

 certainli, that's feel financi
 commun; look toward inflat 5 6 percent instead
 around 4 percent.

 vice chairman solomon. fed back ted truman's 15
 percent depreci dollar?
 mr. kichlin. ye.
 he's caus us difficulti, obvious.
 without ted truman would lower rate inflat!
 believ import argument 1985.
 on

 that's reason altern
 
 vice chairman solomon. assum

 mr. morri. you're show 1984 drop 0.8

 mr. morri.
 it's high.
 
 realli?
 
 matter fact, staff think
 
 7/12-13/83
 
 chairman volcker. low product growth
 1984 compar histor cyclic experi, don't you?
 mr. zeisel.
 product low, certainli base
 earlier postwar experi, [such as] '60s product
 rise [unintellig] percent so.
 [1-1/4]
 percent rang. higher run 1970s;
 twice high, cours plai role. is, fact,
 rel low product. incorpor product
 trend calcul--if on want take kind

 increas 4-1/4 percent.
 mr. prell.

 mr. ball.
 i'd like ask jim anoth question two
 first page chart, lower panel dealt

 that's tough on.

 mr. kichlin. well, on, someth

 mr. ball.

 7/12-13/83

 futur, would reduc inflat expect downward
 pressur long rate.
 thing i'm agon most,
 guess lot peopl around tabl ar, is:
 heck
 caus seriou increas long rate sinc middl mai
 2 month now? inflat expect worsen
 new era short rate go up, arbitrag effect
 go caus long rate go right along irrespect
 chang lack thereof inflat expect?
 mr. kichlin. well, could sai someth, mayb steve
 paul would want comment interpret market
 term happen short run.
 mr. axilrod. presid ball, even year ago short
 rate long rate tend move togeth differ degre.

 recent period, actual, long rate move
 much short rate.
 think it's somewhat surpris,
 think [reflect] anticip fear monetari
 would dare sai short rate went
 tighten.
 sustain wai, would sharp drop long rate.
 don't think moment reflect chang
 inflationari expect. now, level long rate--be high
 real term--might someth budget deficit
 fact need higher real rate govern
 propel forc privat expenditur
 propel forc, level real gnp. least
 big model would give result.
 so, privat spend wouldn't
 high level real rate, independ, without

 mr. meek. i'd add on market factor,
 treasuri third quarter, exampl, sell $60

 mr. ball.
 well, that's right. come back

 wai you'd interpret it,
 that's keep share up.
 mike? that, turn, could effect keep interest
 rate up, guess.
 mr. boehn. wouldn't argu higher rate 1984
 rather lower rate?
 mr. parte. well, gnp increas larg
 4-1/4 percent real around 8
 1984, look it.
