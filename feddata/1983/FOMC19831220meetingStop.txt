 Mr. Axilrod?
 MR. AXILROD. I'll say words Mr. Sternlight might
 also. really little add, Mr. Chairman, eightpage note. memorandum takes opportunity explain how,
 present procedures, one would construct paths contemporaneous
 reserve accounting review paths course two-week
 reserve period. memorandum goes suggest possible
 additional procedures alternatives Committee may wish
 consider, introduce [various] degrees automaticity take
 advantage, speak, contemporaneous reserve requirements.
 These, effect, would let misses deposits, strong weak
 relative path, reflected. case strong deposits
 would somewhat higher borrowings, case weak
 deposits somewhat lower borrowings within reserve period--to
 degree automatically, depending limits Committee may wish
 set, indeed wants go direction. suggested
 couple rather arbitrary procedures, Committee may want

 conditions, there's uncertainty meaning
 use Committee may wish make Ml, variable

 would like add word two.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think Steve summarized note

 MR. AXILROD. two problems look at.

 That's one factor. average, two-week reserve period,

 MR. PARTEE.
 So, we're talking something could

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, little problem here,
 seems me.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, don't make changes

 missing mighty good opportunity control mechanism. least

 eventually we'd able control total reserves better could

 present procedures, Committee really chooses

 alternative ad hoc procedure. So, think 25
 percent unduly low.
 Finally, seems system going work
 well all, force banks adjust

 Mr. Roberts.
 
 MR. ROBERTS. assumption purpose

 put place, improve control aggregates, particularly
 Ml.
 don't want repeat President Black said; I'd like
 associate entirely views. concur him.
 purpose
 going ask question, Steve:
 better control money supply, wouldn't better
 targeting total reserves?
 think [exercise] reduced
 flexibility rather way around. problem
 see increased volatility interest rates,
 think market would adjust readily.
 MR. AXILROD. Well, every multiplier adjustment
 right, would probably case. don't normally get mix
 even money supply type deposits--those small banks
 large banks--exactly right. So, tends throw us off.
 MR. ROBERTS. multiplier differences generally
 short term, though, aren't they?
 MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's right; might average through.
 technical side, study couple years ago-before contemporaneous reserves, even tried
 allow it--seemed suggest, surprisingly, nonborrowed
 reserves probably better controlling Ml month-by-month
 basis total reserves long didn't exactly
 reserve requirement types demand deposits. reduced
 zero, small
 variabilities. three classes now:
 one, large one. Still, would suggest would
 surprised total reserves would [not] quite well
 think would.
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 MR. ROBERTS. I'm thinking target recent months
 actual experience wondering control.
 MR. BLACK. Steve, gets closely point
 Chairman Volcker raising ago. Two kinds demand
 deposits [not] normally Ml: government
 deposits interbank deposits. would think one could pretty well
 estimate going extended period time;
 least little work I've done suggests that. Insofar
 shifts large banks small banks [are concerned], yes,
 short run important; long run wouldn't
 think really messes us much. whole thing
 designed--at least I've perceived way I'm sure others
 also wouldn't [been adopted]--to control Ml because,
 mentioned, that's aggregate subject
 contemporaneous reserve requirements. rest, M2 M3,
 subject lagged reserves. So, go reserve period
 supply reserves needed liabilities
 lagged. put additional amount take care
 interbank government deposits plus think necessary
 achieve right expansion Ml.
 believe that's manageable,
 although, course, agree want control Ml
 that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, seems ought use
 existence CRR reason go M1 go Ml.
 ought give less weight Ml depending judgment
 good intermediate target is. CRR means end;
 seems argument backwards say
 ought put [more weight on] Ml CRR.
 probably case treat Ml footing M2 M3--not
 Ml particularly good, it's whole lot worse
 two. So, think case give equal weight. give
 nearly equal weight equal weight, case
 degree automaticity, strikes something like 25
 percent bad way start. It's reasonable blend
 begin experiment. main point ought judge
 Ml merits; don't think whether CRR reason
 pro con give additional weight Ml.
 MR. BLACK.
 misled you.
 
 thought [predilection], Ed,
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. seems me, already said around

 propose change operating procedures get good

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Gramley.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. Well, terribly sympathetic
 procedures followed October '79 October '82 first
 place haven't looked back period different
 view. I'm even reluctant see us go direction
 elevating Ml even partially toward intermediate target
 increasing automaticity. That's matter week-to-week
 day-to-day even month-to-month variability funds rate
 would looking at, it's fact we're looking

 take past several months. staff anticipating

 think beginning establish somewhat greater credibility
 it's certainly still degree suspicion. So, since CRR

 avoid giving weight, though perhaps full weight, Ml.
 think automaticity desirable that's nature
 whole operation.
 didn't automaticity, form

 total; something range suggested staff
 strikes reasonable compromise.
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Corrigan.
 
 MR. CORRIGAN. Well, almost everybody knows, never
 persuaded case CRR begin I'm still not.

 never thought would make much difference terms well
 could control Ml even decided wanted control M1
 nothing else. agree Mr. Boehne's point, however,
 logically prior decision want Ml.

 quite apart that, must say hunch we're going
 end [interest rate] variability Steve Peter seem
 expect. That's hunch; can't prove either, think
 that's way things going go--that we're going
 noise little improvement control Ml.
 So,
 really druthers, I'd drop whole thing. don't think
 that.
 think argue, though, would call
 "go slow approach," particularly first months.

 Maybe missed something

 MR. AXILROD. pained, Mr. Corrigan, leave options

 MR. AXILROD.
 
 Mr. Chairman, one thing--
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 going give us little analysis
 
 it?
 MR. AXILROD. Yes, thought context

 [about] automaticity response Ml.
 example, M1
 weak amount said borrowing would drop, say, $50 million

 start lower level borrowing. would matter

 So, example, M1 weak M2

 borrowing earlier.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 always come within $50 million anyway!
 
 MR. AXILROD. That's right! next week Ml
 strong, borrowing would $50 million could fluctuate;
 wouldn't make judgmental adjustments borrowing unless whole
 bunch aggregates seemed weak strong relative
 Committee's anticipation whatever rule Committee might want

 MR. PARTEE. say $50 million, start

 don't quite understand.
 MR. AXILROD. Well, suppose started week $650

 fact weak extent borrowing dropped $50 million
 ended $600 million. question comes up: level
 borrowing start next week with?
 I'm saying, unless
 Committee says otherwise, would start $650 million

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. put perspective:
 $50 million
 would imply $500 million dollar weakness Ml were,
 roughly.
 MR. PARTEE.
 guess would thought let

 offsetting [previous weakness], we'd drift back $650 million

 say something then.

 might lot questions. would prepare

 Then, finally, think question is: weight

 we're going discuss anyway. People probably

 put lot weight Ml, wouldn't prepared put full weight

 MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, agree
 entirely, think we've left unsaid one point
 important. is: interim high-risk period 6 months
 we've built wide latitudes reserve requirements we've
 essentially made smaller banks immune process,
 think reduces risk. doesn't eliminate it, certainly
 reduces it.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'll see goes. don't

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could make one observation?
 automatic part, suppose we've agreed Ml deserves little
 emphasis has; runs target
 consequently required reserves higher path, either
 adjust borrowing automatically ad hoc

 adjustments borrowed reserve targets ad hoc

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, they're converted target

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could ask Steve point?
 Steve, think merits experimental
 [seasonal] versus regular one? We've done work suggests
 seasonals probably bad last part [of year].
 Hence, didn't much burst Ml earlier haven't
 much slowdown since then. one believes makes
 lot difference, think, one comes out.
 MR. AXILROD. Well, memory look two

 small differences, big ones. somewhat

 I'm sure

 exception one negative month it's -0.5 percent,
 fluctuates 3 7 percent. So, tends look

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Yes, looks much like drop

 MR. AXILROD. Whereas series looks like

 point getting prepared recommend Board
 drop experimental series, mainly wasn't showing

 proving weekly monthly seasonals difficult get
 Ml inherently volatile series. That's would
 interpret Ml. looks experimental series made
 comeback. seems still value would

 experimentally. hasn't demonstrated--and haven't found--a way

 we've reacted quickly.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 It's hard argue one!

 Now, said side, also think risk

 also likely get stronger economy. Also, find
 great sensitivity interest rates there--a view [higher]
 interest rates could shut fairly promptly. it's
 worth, sense interest rates went 1 percentage

 great deal; increase 1 2 point range,
 feel really would major effect psychology. good

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Martin.
 
 MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, asked comments regard
 downside risk aspects economy. Let mention
 two three, beginning projections regard
 commercial property development fixed investment sector.
 President Boykin mentioned speculation land. want take

 President Boehne's comments regard interest rates:

 Governor Rice.
 
 MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, wanted say
 already said one way another--especially Governor
 Wallich. However, assessment downside risks quite
 his. I'm quite guarded outlook. seems
 activity likely continue strong next year,
 particularly first half year, decelerate somewhat
 second half still expand acceptable rate
 unemployment continuing fall. So, don't see business activity
 falling unacceptable levels period next year.
 I'm little optimistic inflation outlook think
 people expressed. don't share worry respect
 wage outlook. think wage picture probably still one
 moderation. It's hard see profits going continue
 expand rate weaken resistance higher wages
 improve really significantly bargaining position labor. So,
 would expect continued moderation wage increases. energy
 picture looks pretty good outlook moderate--not
 runaway--increases food prices. So, going
 strong inflationary pressures, it's hard see
 going come from. So, see inflation outlook reasonably
 favorable--pretty much staff forecast. Along
 vulnerabilities listed Governor Wallich, would simply emphasize,
 others pointed out, major vulnerability higher
 interest rates expect--that is, higher
 forecast. number people pointed that, think
 possibly real danger interest rates substantially higher
 forecast. reasons that, obviously,
 deficit, increase private credit demands, falling
 capital inflows. possibilities would operate toward
 putting upward pressure interest rates. happens,
 think economy vulnerable possibly danger
 damage development. don't, however, expect rates
 increase substantially, although recognize possibility
 could affect forecast, pointed out. balance, would
 say probability 50 percent able maintain
 current levels interest rates; we're able that,
 think [the economy] good shape.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. might ask Mr. Kichline comment
 point Mr. Corrigan made earlier, inverse profits
 point. true labor costs going much less--or
 historically little--compared prices stage? don't
 address unless want to. We'll turn Governor
 Partee.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, asked different hypothesis

 whole period recovery. probably largest
 
 -26-
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 going see anytime expansion; [the increases] go
 rather up. So, I'm wondering whether we're
 picking degree false optimism business community
 whether fact doesn't lay us open possibility high
 expectations frustrated months come. see
 least possibility.
 Now, look projection, greatest problem
 it--I've before--is saving rate low.
 think ought higher; would expect higher given
 income performance, given incentives save

 reasonable ratio financial saving stocks total income. way
 would get saving rate higher either higher income

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. PARTEE. Well, can't even understand involved
 argument since haven't briefed it, can't
 that. could higher income extent
 demand economy outside consumer sector, principally perhaps
 inventory demand. That's possibility; could inventory
 demand income generation result and, therefore,
 higher savings result higher income projected.

 Governor Teeters.
 
 MS. TEETERS. Well, listen discussion around

 laps, [given] sensitivity economy interest rates
 --the current levels changes interest rates. begin

 crucial factor determining whether achieve

 actually conducting monetary policy way created

 sensitive interest rates--particularly starting level
 are--that move 100 basis points would completely turn

 also. So, whole combination this, think, turns

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, guess come somewhat
 differently. New York Fed staff's forecast stronger growth

 Mr. Kichline's forecast.
 won't bother going components arrive

 productivity guess.
 I'm particularly impressed, unfortunately,
 increased talk hear financial markets rising

 So,
 point view, there's fairly clear implication snugging
 up, possibly. hand, though, thing bothers
 exchange rate getting looming menace
 difference sense. higher keeps going precipitously
 it's going drop expectations regarding exchange rate turn
 around. It's going drop time we're nearer capacity

 I'm
 even talking developing countries burden.
 think it's
 real time bomb.
 So, quandary conflicting analyses

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Kichline.
 
 MR. KICHLINE.
 Mr. Corrigan's point, don't chart
 here. sorts numbers chart.

 clearly, though, situation assume unit labor
 costs 1983 rising 1 percent deflator forecast
 something like 4-1/4 percent increase.
 So, it's wide spread.
 shows corporate profits, corporate profits cycle
 --for first four quarters recovery, assuming fourthquarter forecast correct--have risen postwar
 cycle. close increase 1975, substantially
 cyclical performance first year recovery. Two
 comments regard spread-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 profits stronger?
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 may interrupt you:
 
 increase
 
 Correct.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 GNP corporate product?
 
 relationship profits
 
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's profit share
 notional margins rising. think highest
 level end year since 1977-78--a six-year high. So,
 done well share absolutely. Two particular comments:
 First, going back staff's inflation presentation, believe
 corporations essentially price notion unit labor cost
 markup that. effect, they're looking
 notion trend growth productivity; trend growth
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -31-
 
 productivity, think, better may using. So,
 showing terms attempts price fairly aggressively
 they're getting profits might otherwise think.
 second point technical comment:
 measuring GNP deflator,
 know, import prices subtracted short run.
 first half year import prices actually declined
 unchanged third quarter, much year
 think substraction process artificially raised GNP
 deflator benefits import prices measured
 consumption, investment, whatever, come along lag. So,
 story unusual year.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. consumer price index
 lower it's not; it's higher.
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's higher deflator
 different weights things going on. Obviously, service
 prices, example, important. suspect 1984
 year returns much normal sense forecast
 unit labor costs deflator rising amount,
 gap we're seeing think evaporate.
 MS. TEETERS. Jim, technical question
 increase profits talking
 probable effects could
 course year:
 corporations end

 large

 higher profits,
 increases also?
 
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, go back notion
 sense normalcy restored, think happening here-profits weak last 3 4 years--and indeed
 productivity improving, think depends ultimately
 context market situation have. forecast,
 markets generally tight allow corporations
 pass aggressively whatever price increases might want.
 restraint domestically import side. So,
 think profits you're right. Ultimately, works
 depend part economy evolves 1984.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. profits manufacturing
 sector alone? cover tomorrow.
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 Okay, detail.
 
 MR. CORRIGAN. Well, consider automobile
 industry alone, it's going make $5 billion year. suspect
 profits manufacturing too--just sharply, terms
 increases profits, rest economy.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. probably pretty sharply,
 don't know absolute levels.
 Well, think might well quit evening,
 nobody else anything say subject, turn [tomorrow]

 December 20,
 
 1983--Morning Session
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. begin discussion 1984
 discussion Congress requiring
 ranges.
 ranges 1985, two years ahead, might want consider
 might say 1985, least qualitative way,
 present 1984 ranges.
 Obviously, don't decide
 even precise 1984 now. anybody strikingly
 different feelings encompassed preliminary ones--or
 radically different way looking things--this would
 think Bluebook paragraph
 appropriate time bring up.
 two good discussion various considerations
 brought bear.
 fit inflation
 discussion last time think responsibilities
 practical possibilities dealing inflation
 longer time-frame kinds things reflected
 long-term targets.
 don't know whether anything add, Mr.
 Axilrod, comments Bluebook.
 MR. AXILROD.
 don't much, Mr. Chairman. could
 briefly point trying there. mentioned,
 first instance trying discuss tentative ranges
 terms consistency regard inflation objectives.
 Obviously, 1984 tentative ranges consistent
 progress reducing inflation assuming, clear there,
 Committee looking toward lower rates inflation 5
 percent currently projected 1984.
 that, course,
 would particular relevance anything Committee might want
 say, qualitatively not, 1985.
 technical points regard ranges:

 1984, Ml range 4 8 percent reduction, course,
 range second half 1983 think implies, given
 9 percent nominal GNP, velocity increase order 2
 percent without interest rate rise--somewhat lower trend
 postwar period years, around 3 percent
 occurred period rising short-term rates. Now,
 velocity Ml, everyone knows, going uncertain
 probably different significant interest rate
 movements levels projected. given
 projection little interest rate change, think Ml
 increase around middle--or likely upper part--of 4
 8 percent would likely outcome, consistent
 projected nominal GNP.
 ought point two things:
 noted
 Bluebook, [tentative 1984] M3 range decreased 6 9
 percent. problem may would squeeze M3 pretty much
 considerable part credit flows continue go
 financial institutions. two reasons thinking would
 possible get M3 growth 9 percent below. One
 continuing efforts banks raise funds abroad
 Eurodollars domestically CDs, would tend hold
 M3 growth, particularly foreigners put money dollars
 abroad. regard M2, would also point 1/2 point
 reduction range 7 10 percent 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent
 might considered effective reduction since 7 10
 percent range included 1/2 1 percentage point shifts
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -34-
 
 related money market deposit accounts. far could
 judge, amount shifting 7 10 percent probably
 order 1/2 1 percent, estimates always
 difficult make. Thus, reduction 1/2 point 6-1/2 9-1/2
 percent not, sense, effective reduction. Counterbalancing
 that, course, observe normal reduction
 velocity growth M2 second year recovery, would
 given nominal GNP require somewhat higher M2 might
 otherwise occur. think preliminary comments
 would have.
 MR. WALLICH. Could ask question, Steve? set
 targets tentatively July, think aggregates
 tops ranges. still case M2 M3,
 less, Ml dropped almost bottom range.
 So, effect, we've base drift 3 percentage points,
 haven't we?
 took monitoring range
 target, wanted arrive level Ml end
 target period, end fourth quarter 1984, would
 really go 4 8 percent 7 11 percent. say
 intend propose this, indicate
 base drift seems change, I'm mistaken, one thinks
 right thing do.
 MR. AXILROD. Yes. made calculation;
 planning make Committee February meeting
 knew actual outcome.
 MR. WALLICH.
 
 something kind case, isn't
 
 it?
 MR. AXILROD. Yes. center 5 9 percent range
 wanted start from, I'm sure rate
 growth would be. calculate we're waiting here,
 would higher rate growth now.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. think we've fairly consistent
 ignoring kinds considerations.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 That's done [unintelligible].
 
 MR. WALLICH. Yes, drifted up; we're drifting down.
 think money bank, speak. shouldn't
 let go--
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, would
 attributed special importance 7 percent whatever is.
 think said time would perfectly happy
 low growth velocity high we'd perfectly happy
 high growth velocity low.
 MR. WALLICH. Well, doesn't change calculations,
 it, velocity may still change? can't expect the-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. changes arithmetic, don't
 think there's great significance 7 percent. Mr. Morris.
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -35-
 
 MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, lot problems
 this, might surmise. seems range
 much confidence going predictably related 9
 percent nominal GNP growth range credit.
 I've arguing
 couple years changed character M1 means
 relationship nominal GNP predictable. seems
 two years pretty good evidence side.

 assume, apparently done here, get
 less normal return historical Ml velocity--I hope turns
 case range adopted--is act faith rather
 assumption scientific basis.
 think ranges M2
 M3 even worse, history last 25 years shows
 second year expansion average M2 M3 velocity
 declined 2-1/2 percent.
 Therefore, one wanted range
 wide enough finance 9 percent nominal GNP growth, upper limit
 ought 11-1/2 percent.
 I'm persuaded staff made
 strong case effect M2 M3 velocity going
 much different '84 past.
 Also, year
 election year, would hope could adopt targets
 wouldn't changing election. abandoned
 M1 target mid-1982 rebased Ml target mid-1983.
 mid-1984 might generate implication Federal
 Reserve changing course political reasons.
 So, think it's
 important year years
 reasonable degree confidence targets we're setting
 compatible nominal GNP objective.
 don't think
 confidence ranges Ml, M2, M3.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 You'd like see higher?
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 don't know. don't know set range
 Ml base [period] use it.
 would rather eliminate
 Ml target. taking position call something else
 --say, monitoring range--to observation market doesn't seem
 notice difference monitoring range target.

 think Ml numbers probably sounder numbers
 M2 M3.
 persuaded performance M2 M3
 going dramatically different previous second
 years expansion last 25 years.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. evidence second year
 expansion previous 25 years, Mr. Axilrod?
 MR. AXILROD. don't rates growth hand;
 velocities hand.
 almost impossible analyze,
 course, ceiling rates that. second year
 expansion velocities M2 negative. is,
 drops velocity order 3 percent first quarter
 '61 second year expansion, 1 percent early '70s,
 3-1/4 percent '75 trough. 1980 irrelevant,
 course. '60s, '50s, increases
 velocity 1 percent. decelerations
 speak first year; decelerations turned
 negative velocity. assumed also deceleration velocity

 So, it's inconsistent kind cyclical experience.
 velocity continuing positive, think
 probably also reasonable given changed institutional
 circumstances.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think really two
 questions address today. first, course,
 aggregate aggregates we're going emphasize.
 second numerical ranges targets ought
 coming year. suspect would think, strongly
 favor returning Ml increasing emphasis it. I'd make
 primary target. seems reasonable suppose that, given
 sharp increase velocity Ml fourth quarter,
 probability much greater traditional relationship
 Ml GNP may resuming. addition, think one judge Ml
 alternatives. seems case M2
 M3 almost anything else think really good
 Ml, despite imperfections Ml obviously
 past. Committee agree increase emphasis Ml,
 think ought consider lowering 8 percent top
 tentatively set next year. approach target
 standpoint Bluebook paragraph 12--the paragraph Steve
 mentioning ago--an 8 percent growth top, given
 projection nominal GNP 9.1 percent fourth quarter
 year fourth quarter next year, would imply rise
 velocity 1 percent. figure would
 attach high degree probability given recent resumption
 velocity [growth] Ml also probable absence
 major changes regulatory area. fundamentally, 8
 percent seems really consistent long period
 time stated objective dealing long run
 inflationary problems. So, I'd really like knock
 couple points that. That's probably going acceptable
 group, case would argue ought put
 top maybe 7 percent, want little devious say 4
 8 percent we're going use [lower] half
 range. don't like [latter] approach, really.
 far M2 M3 concerned, could accept keeping
 preliminary ranges set July, although Steve
 pointed minute ago Bluebook mentioned, doesn't
 really represent reduction rate growth M2 1984.
 So, think 6 9 percent would preferable figure would give
 stronger signal market anti-inflationary resolve.
 look aware stick
 tentative 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent range, really haven't made
 effort way base set. far M3
 concerned, technical reasons raising
 range, seem plausible me, wouldn't mind
 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent. 1985, clearly, purpose ought
 cut whatever ranges adopt still further, keeping often
 stated objective working rate growth aggregates

 far figures concerned, think
 wait decide want 1984 try put
 [specific] numbers that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Wallich.
 
 MR. WALLICH. 1984 targets, see reason
 change July. far Ml target concerned,
 already implied reduction 3 percent targets
 base drift, said before.
 see 4 8 percent
 meaning 6 percent average; implies velocity gain 3
 percent nominal GNP 9 percent, seems
 right.
 would like restore Ml partly fully yet
 would like maintain wider range, given uncertainty.
 nothing say M2, M3, credit.
 regards 1985 possibility sort

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Martin.
 
 MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, good discussion
 last FOMC meeting certain relationships certain theories
 inflation inflation's forces factors. seems
 discussion relevant outreaching 1985
 extent considerations 1984. validity
 notion 1985 changes Ml [will behind us], however
 uncertain velocity however difficult anticipate
 results contemporaneous reserve requirement accounting,
 balance year 1984 bearing
 conditions activity 1985.
 would, therefore,
 forget Ml regardless uncertainties mentioned,
 believe yet move Ml importance
 exposition policies going
 [implementing] them. seems market focusing
 somewhat free reserves borrowing levels previously
 almost obsession Ml diminished somewhat; think
 that's probably salutary. Perhaps means market better
 understanding we're really trying do. So, wouldn't
 forget Ml; would keep among targets, certainly, believe
 uncertainties need wide range 1984 and,
 therefore, 4 8 percent acceptable.
 regard question 1985, would join
 support presentation perhaps bit stronger language regarding
 reluctance fund total expenditures, part 40
 percent [spending by] federal government. I'd like
 pick additional tens billions off-budget
 financing look situation one financing

 Let
 MS. TEETERS.
 Well, agree [Governor Martin].
 take 1985 issue. First all, really don't think
 forecast. look back past 5 years, we've missed turning
 points almost everything happened--well, everything
 happened think forecast
 staff done good job.
 lock something
 far two years, variety go on,
 think mistake. year changed targets we've
 accommodated changes economy occurred,
 changes various aggregates come along, forecast
 changed.
 must say point view markets
 responded [well] reasonable shift policy. We've
 kept informed doing. rigidly setting
 targets, particularly two years, changing economy
 doesn't make much sense all.
 remember exercises
 4 5 years ago ran econometric model [to evaluate]
 probabilities, found pretty good forecasting
 next quarter next two quarters.
 begin lose
 become less certain three quarters even uncertain four
 quarters out; time get year-and-a-half two years
 out, econometric models give us almost random numbers.
 might
 well Administration 5-year projections,
 take annual rate growth, string out, put
 hopeful inflation number, forecasts 2, 3, 4,
 5 years don't reality them. So, lock
 something 1985 doesn't make sense.
 think
 talk it.
 talk great deal fiscal policy
 problem implies monetary policy, don't think
 lock in.
 1984 targets, [many of] seem assume
 we're going right 1984.
 think lot
 hazards there. still don't know Ml doing. think
 need wide range it; I'm terribly satisfied 4 8
 percent, certainly wouldn't lower wouldn't narrow it.
 M3, aggregate always grows rate close 9-1/2
 percent, ridiculous try something else it.

 seems might well face reality put
 numbers 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent know it's going

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Roberts.
 
 MR. ROBERTS.
 Well, Mr. Chairman, respect 1985
 longer-term period, would cautious expressing specific
 mathematical ranges unless required
 would rather see us qualitative objective,
 Congress.
 reduce inflation steadily we've eliminated eventually
 whatever period might encompass.
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -44-
 
 1984, think 4 8 percent range, view
 developing Ml, probably wide. would inclined
 say 4 7 percent, except whatever reasons directed
 growth Ml tended lower end range rather
 otherwise. So, tendency, would inclined
 say 5 8 percent, raising bottom figure. reason I'm
 concerned recent slowdown we've Ml, said
 yesterday, whether measured 13 percent first half 5
 percent second half measured 4 5 months, essentially,
 growth. terms leads here, think probable
 slowdown economy second third quarters already built
 in; surge money late last year earlier
 year, think increase inflation built late next year
 early 1985. don't want us like businessmen
 refer extrapolate present fight ebullience
 economy right now. would rather see us get Ml growing
 moderate pace. Alternative B, essentially suggests 6
 percent [MI growth] pattern, acceptable me; may slightly
 high side, think unless get going
 cost terms real output 1984 sanguine
 1984. would like see us accept fact
 aberration velocity caused recession, lower inflation,
 lower interest rates new deposit accounts may ending.
 see sharp rise velocity fourth quarter. think
 get onto trend line assumption velocity, since
 clearly can't predicted short run, build money
 growth rates around that. accept order 3
 percent, 6 percent accommodates 9 percent nominal GNP.
 So, would like see us remove Ml so-called monitoring
 range [status] since really one variable control
 directly. I'd place least equal aggregates
 preferably give primary status. importantly, I'd like
 see us something get growing again. forecast 8
 percent December we've forecasts increases month
 month haven't materialized. note
 decreasing reserves November December seems that's
 expected result type policy.

 would say every intention continuing

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. join would
 want make quantitative announcements 1985.
 also
 would like see us maybe quantify time we're looking
 forward moving toward price stability; I'm talking 5- 6year program gradual reduction period time, yet
 accommodating may happening real economy. seems
 since 1971 1972 continued say moving

 regard 1984 ranges proposed Bluebook
 set tentatively July, problem Ml range 4
 8 percent.
 matter fact, take little comfort
 4 percentage point spread range. M2 M3, would
 probably opt drop M2 range 6 9 percent [shown
 M3] Bluebook. reason that, stated around
 table before, inconsistent M2 range
 that's greater M3 range. it's difficult explain
 M3 lower M2 simply hope fund
 credit needs Eurodollars, also implies continuing
 strength dollar assumes European countries
 developed nations would continue operating low
 rate economic growth. picture think avoid,
 whether true not, simply making M2 M3 ranges
 consistent other. would opt 6 9
 percent.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Partee.
 
 MR. PARTEE.
 I'm fairly optimistic. said yesterday,
 think 1984 okay year. don't really think it's
 going vigorous Lyle, example, suggested.
 also
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -46-
 
 don't think it's going weak suggested could
 yesterday-MR. MARTIN.
 
 Christmas already?
 
 --in particular configuration
 MR. PARTEE.
 I'm greatly concerned 9 percent nominal
 working out.
 GNP number fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. think it's one
 far see, figures staff given us
 key on.
 pretty consistent 9 percent GNP number. So, think
 target growth rates specified 1984 ballpark.
 ought terms think would produce
 would consistent 9 percent GNP growth.
 Regardless happens next year, though, really
 think 1985 going problem. third
 that's
 year recovery--if recovery lasts year.
 recovery getting pretty old; it's getting time
 inflationary pressures get greater. certainly going
 time pressures credit markets ought grow
 increasing private demand. would agree Lyle role
 deficit really affect credit market conditions
 affect economy whole, pluses
 minuses fiscal policy may short run least
 offsetting. So, see year 1985 developing one
 may credit-crunch type conditions--and generally
 forecast market--do want say we're going
 reduce growth rates aggregates
 concept long-run non-inflationary environment, thus ensure
 doubt want
 credit crunch 1985?
 say that.
 So, would avoid specific number 1985
 reason, want give much encouragement possible
 hope might fiscal action 1985
 over. Again, seems extremely unlikely big
 fiscal move taking effect first part '85; might take
 don't know
 effect spring summer '85.
 timing would be, even fiscal policy action--except
 seems unlikely would beginning
 year--that makes extremely difficult state kind policy
 tradeoff. So, wouldn't specify anything '85.
 think Ml done quite lot better people
 around table give credit for. period it's
 certainly true doesn't look [consistent with] GNP number,
 that's doesn't stability characteristics
 M2 M3 total credit make glide along
 normative number isn't far, usually, GNP number.
 think performance Ml bad
 indicative going happen economy
 going
 anything M2 shown last couple years.
 say, Nancy, M2 9 percent every year, good bad,
 So, can't say
 already said M3 9-1/2 percent regardless.
 except seems also true. M2, way, think
 
 shouldn't show decline velocity characteristic earlier
 periods we've disintermediation because, all, 80 90
 percent total interest sensitive. think
 [depository] institutions competitive rates
 offer credit demands increase. certainly try keep
 
 12/19-20/83

 flows coming and, therefore, think could expect M2
 show even stability shown past
 institutions operate M2 operated M3 past-and source funding. So, would give status
 Ml.
 would adopt staff's proposals, guess pretty
 much set preliminary way last July.
 would quiet specific numbers 1985.
 One point:
 want agree Ed Boehne
 don't think expect make progress every year rate
 inflation anyhow. think look full cycle
 process. keep inflation rate accelerating much
 beyond 5 percent, certainly keep accelerating beyond 6
 percent course cycle, go zero
 next recession. we'll much better posture
 much less inflationary cycle next time around.
 don't think
 it's reasonable say 4-1/2 percent inflation forecast
 next year 1985 we'll bring 4 percent 1986
 3-1/2 percent 1987 3 percent. can't that.

 dynamics economy won't permit it.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, think concept price

 think whatever words use 1985 obviously reflect that.

 also would want use specific numbers.

 certainly terms credibility. said bring

 would inclined bring Ml range line
 Bob Black suggesting, possibly 3 7 percent.

 willing put emphasis Ml, think
 believable, thus would positive that.
 think
 [range] would also consistent enough [Ml growth]
 9 percent nominal GNP growth. M2 range, would inclined
 shade 6 9 percent since 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent
 doesn't represent real reduction. M3, would probably go
 back 6-1/2 9-1/2 percent growth always
 9-1/2 percent.
 seems would give better picture.
 would argue strongly shading Ml target 1984.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Rice.
 
 MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, agree almost everything
 Governor Teeters said.
 I'm able look much beyond 1984
 and, therefore, I'm unable say anything specific 1985.

 would like able say general terms hope
 things develop 1984 way continue move
 direction price stability 1985.
 1984, think tentative target ranges
 realistic--that is, consistent staff forecast
 expect happen, exception mentioned Nancy
 M3 range could raised order avoid
 possibility squeezing. So, exception minor change
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 -48-
 
 raising M3 range 1/2 percentage point, think ranges
 good, satisfactory, realistic.
 think reiterate
 strong terms commitment long-run price stability.
 think it's important demonstrate commitment
 targets select, we've done case. We've reduced
 ranges 2 3 continue that,
 inflationary expectations affected manner would

 ranges presented except M3.
 incidentally, I'm also encouraged
 recent behavior M1 velocity. I'm yet ready

 would like watch

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES. Sometimes, Mr. Chairman, helps get outside

 Another thing, far I'm concerned, came
 conference something compromise point view, guess,
 happen Ml period 1982 velocity
 dropping unprecedented amount. everything said done
 really two basic explanations among
 academics going on. Perhaps bit
 oversimplified, one explanation business cycle

 12/19-20/83

 view, lean toward San Francisco, big drop

 don't expect another

 fact middle recession.
 I'm
 extra targets we're almost bound hit.
 best thing
 say M2 M3 terms keeping targets
 they're almost impossible miss. guess that's without
 merit compared target jumps around. But, frankly,
 wouldn't give much weight them.
 think continue
 we're going undermine credibility

 Specifically, would go direction implied
 Bluebook perhaps it's time reduce spread M1

 years ago spread 2 points par course.
 don't think

 consideration reducing spread 3 points. time
 don't believe we're trying make final decisions, Mr. Chairman,
 certainly would moment want see 3-point spread
 centered higher 6 percent might even favor aiming 5
 percent midpoint.
 we're going 6 percent midpoint,
 would go for, could consider range 4-1/2
 7-1/2 percent, willing adopt 3-point range
 rather 4-point range.
 It's without precedent

 So, think original proposal quite
 
 good one. don't see ought bias result starting

 fact, things strengthen quite bit weeks come, ought
 let borrowing run strengthening occurs. would
 feel good deal willing see snugging could get
