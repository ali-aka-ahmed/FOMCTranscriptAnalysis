 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. real performance.
 [decide on] long-run [monetary] targets next year soon
 present [economic] projections.
 proposals
 present projections 1988, happens coincide
 [the period covered in] last table [distributed
 presentation].
 We're yet obligated that; don't know
 whether time get around presenting longrange projections. We're going decide
 collectively look situation. staff pretty sharp
 decline M2 1984 get track [toward price stability].
 going year?
 MR. STOCKTON. M2 price stability case 6 percent
 that's projection 1984 8 percent increase
 annual rate.
 MR. PARTEE. understand say productivity
 growth 1 percent higher--that is, 2 percent rather 1 percent-that unemployment rate associated long-term projection
 would point lower?
 MR. STOCKTON. That's correct. That's assume
 2 percent productivity growth rate, unemployment rate could fall
 8.1 percent end 1984 would stay 7-3/4
 percent rate throughout last four years price stability
 scenario.
 MR. PARTEE.

 MR. STOCKTON.
 MR. PARTEE.

 MR. STOCKTON.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Would mean total output would quite
 Yes.
 
 That's correct.
 
 lower unemployment
 
 That's correct.
 see.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. I'd like ask increase GNP
 deflator 1985.
 take 6-1/2 percent natural rate [of
 unemployment] we're 2 percentage points '84
 '85, get us, according formula, 1-1/2
 percentage point reduction inflation per year.
 offset
 drop average unemployment rate 9-1/2 8-1/2
 '83 '84; add quarter percentage
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 point inflation rate. So, balance, one would think
 '85 ought come 1 1-1/4 percentage point lower
 inflation rate '84. going up.
 [explain]?
 MR. STOCKTON. Yes. difference exchange rate
 behaves quite differently. price stability case still
 depreciation exchange rate coming accounts
 difference.
 MR. GRAMLEY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. PARTEE. You've taken fairly restrictive definition
 price stability. sensitive last table that?
 said price stability 1-1/2 percent something like instead
 essentially [zero]--
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 see tolerant are!
 
 case get [price stability]
 
 1987.
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, couple things keep
 mind price stability [scenario] we're presenting.
 first thing next two years think we're facing
 couple hurdles going make difficult reach price
 stability: food price shock going showing
 1984 substantial increase social security tax.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 big that?
 
 MR. STOCKTON. accounts 0.4 percent
 compensation four quarters 1984. So, that's almost half
 point added back onto compensation. depreciation
 dollar cases examining
 momentum recovery moving 1984. So, spend first two
 years almost cases keeping lid special
 factors think tending boost inflation '84 '85.
 Even case we're presenting achieve price
 deceleration really last three years. So, get
 deceleration occurring three years spend first
 two years--the next two years--holding things think
 apt boost inflation. either case costs, obviously,
 less higher make target rate inflation end
 period. require fairly low rates growth,
 particularly next two years.
 MR. CORRIGAN. end period we're shooting
 for, say, 1-1/2 percent, would loosely translate saying
 could afford 1 percent per year real growth? Or, what's
 order magnitude?
 SPEAKER(?). done exercise specifically
 would guess would marginally lower unemployment

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 Mr. Morris.
 
 Might well go broke--go zero.

 MR. MORRIS.
 intuitive feeling 1 percent
 productivity assumption pessimistic see many
 structural changes made last three years terms
 reducing staff overhead terms changes work rules.
 went 1970s lower rate productivity growth
 could explain basis ordinary analytical factors,
 got big negative residual.
 seems maybe
 start see bounceback; maybe we'll start getting positive
 residual. basis 1 percent productivity
 assumption, think 1 percentage point low?
 MS. ZICKLER. point business cycle we're
 seeing increases largely cyclical nature.
 try best
 look increases see underlying trend
 type behavior would consistent with. that's basically
 came it.
 Now, you're right, last
 recession saw lot shedding labor, lot changes
 kept productivity growing--even last year period
 normally would decline.
 So, extent, developments
 talk could once-and-for-all changes
 productivity level wouldn't become embodied continued
 improvement growth rate. extent business

 define '70s well--then, yes, could
 think coming year critical year

 evaluating productivity path generally
 shows second year recovery sharp deceleration
 toward trend rate growth.
 keep getting information
 tells us productivity better 1 percent,
 firm view perhaps trend changing could
 closer 2 percent whatever.
 MR. MARTIN. didn't mention experienced labor

 MS. ZICKLER. Well, certainly, reversal problem

 Looking ahead, yes, demographics

 Mr. Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.

 recession period 6 7 years. seen lots forecasts
 always based gradualist approach--that we're going
 bring inflation gradually. reality, look back
 history inflation, inflation really comes
 recessions. last time really knocked inflation head
 1950s three recessions 8-year period
 going early 60s. So, question is: recession
 terms bringing inflation terms real
 variables?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, think recession obviously gets
 inflation rate much faster. you're right it's
 difficult models project business cycles. earlier
 reduction output immediate effect
 lowering inflation. Then, lowers inflation expectations
 subsequent periods sharp contraction output could
 lead substantial reduction inflation would bring
 inflation expectations past two years.
 essence, costs paid cases [through]
 recession slow growth.
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's also case
 '85 '86 based little 1 percent real growth, economy
 really rather delicately balanced small growth
 declining output. shorten time horizon, model quite

 MR. STOCKTON. Well, looked path Ml would

 M1 path goes along baseline case would around 5
 percent next year would stay 5 percent following year
 drop 2-1/4 percent 1988.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Gradually?
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Gradually, yes. It's straight line,
 like putting ruler piece paper; gradually.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 something like 5,5,4,3, 2 percent?

 MR. STOCKTON.

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. model assume

 MR. STOCKTON.

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 Steadily 5-year period?

 Well, would impact like demand shift.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. wanted observe gut
 reaction real GNP projection perhaps understated,
 especially 1984.
 really wanted ask question
 deficit reduction. kind assumption making deficit
 reductions 1985?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 baseline price stability scenario
 assume starting 1985 equal cuts made taxes

 So, get $30 billion first year, $60
 billion next year, $90 billion following year, $120
 billion following year.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. remarkable give

 MR. RICE.
 
 It's there.

 MR. KICHLINE.
 mentioned.
 
 didn't focus that, it's certainly
 
 MR. RICE. part question wanted ask.
 feasible monetary policy consistent progress
 reducing deficit?
 certainly is.
 
 required--
 
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. CORRIGAN.
 
 don't want hear it.
 
 MR. RICE.
 
 feasible one, doable one?
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Yes. fact fiscal action taken,
 makes bit easier achieve price stability. Now, reason
 cutting deficit leads exchange rate effects
 effect interest rates. smaller deficits lead
 lower interest rates effect depreciating
 dollar, leads higher inflation, offset
 less output. So, fact, unemployment path needed
 achieve price stability, assume fiscal action, would
 0.2 percentage point year lower we-VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. don't agree that,
 point current account deficit gets larger larger
 larger, huge leaps, we'll see higher interest rates. It's
 going prevent change--some depreciation dollar.
 MR. TRUMAN. That's precisely correct, think. Let
 make two points President Solomon. One extent
 built baseline projection depreciation
 dollar price stability, essentially, would view part
 process got dollar strong build big
 current account deficit. fact don't much built
 necessary keep current account deficit
 current range. So, therefore, possible could go
 further, Mr. Stockton mentioned talked
 exogenous factors--exogenous outside currently
 predicted--being part process. sense part
 paying price good luck dollar
 appreciation dollar gotten earlier
 accelerated short-run process disinflation.
 reverses itself, lag comes system get much
 more. would regard projection sense neutral
 agnostic extent doesn't involve big
 buildup current account. That's true baseline
 projection. Similarly, doesn't involve much correction
 value dollar; given relatively moderate growth
 rest world get big improvement
 current account period. sense would say
 it's somewhat agnostic way takes-VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let ask question you.
 answered Governor Rice would easier achieve price
 stability didn't get rid budget deficit
 higher interest rate effect higher dollar, also
 assuming major recession?
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 MR. STOCKTON. No.
 output path associated
 one here. would basically same; there's difference.
 It's fairly uniform, adding output along cases given.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. understand correctly,
 assumption reducing deficit it's bad inflation?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 That's correct.
 
 MR. KICHLINE.
 think we've cautious presenting
 issues respect inflation expectations, that's
 one presumably channel influence terms deficit
 actions feeding back inflation expectations.
 model simply
 doesn't capture that.
 think Dave stated that.
 So, it's
 area expectations model models weak
 offers something positive terms potential outcome.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's agnostic point Mr.
 Solomon raising whether deficits
 nice smooth path?
 MR. TRUMAN. particular point achieving
 better outcome 1988 [unintelligible] defined way extent
 different fiscal/monetary [policy] mix period gives
 higher interest rates, higher dollar, larger current
 account deficit.
 So, likewise, might look beyond 1988
 would go backwards correction process.
 would work harder terms
 correction felt kind current account deficit would
 sustainable extended period time. So, would
 pay price later that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. much level interest rates
 affect inflation forecast?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, level interest rates plays
 small role cost capital effects, capital 35
 percent.
 don't think that's major effect short-run price
 determination.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 There's cost push high interest
 
 rates?
 rates.
 
 MR. STOCKTON. There's small cost push higher interest
 That's true general outlook.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. say cost capital, mean
 terms cost terms affecting amount investment?
 MR. STOCKTON. mean terms cost rather affecting
 amount investment.
 MS. TEETERS. level interest rates changes, then,
 required get particular path real GNP?
 MR. STOCKTON. federal funds rate 10-3/4 percent
 path 1984 drifts 9 percent 1988.
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 MS. TEETERS. implication rising interest rates
 short term order produce decreased rate real growth
 price stability.
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 That's correct.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. still 9 percent interest rates
 1 percent 3/4 percent rise prices?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 That's correct.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Wallich.
 
 MR. WALLICH. cost capital 30 percent:
 include depreciation?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 

 
 Yes.
 
 MR. WALLICH. tell little period
 data model reach? impression model
 derives data mostly period nobody believed
 inflation could reduced .7 percent, naturally
 built strong resistance that. Now, could
 credible policy--if believed alternative assumption,
 last one [listed], possible done--wouldn't
 invalidate many assumptions underlying past data?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, would certainly change. hope
 made clear alternative assumption [of "credible"
 disinflation policy]--the last one we've listed price stability
 --is clearly possibility would alter cost achieving price
 stability. Now, past couple years, credibility issue
 difficult. think many economists went said:
 We've never observations unemployment high
 stayed high long. reestimated
 models found looked prices sensitive higher
 rates unemployment previously thought. it's
 clear. We're able distinguish hypothesis prices
 sensitive high rates unemployment hypothesis
 perhaps credibility effect bringing inflation
 faster might thought back 1980.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. went similar exercise using
 [MPS] model. difference staff done
 baseline case used Ml money growth rate. started
 6 percent 1984 dropped 1 point per year next 3
 years, using 5 percent 1985, 4 percent 1986, 3 percent
 1987 1988. measurable effect output
 sense it's marginally higher 1984 roughly
 percentage point higher 1985 1986. brings
 inflation rate 1 percent end five-year period.
 So, use Ml, dropping 1 percent year

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's relevant question way:

 better numbers? Mr. Roberts, maybe tell us.
 MR. ROBERTS.
 
 sorry.
 
 really can't help much that;
 
 two comments, sort questions.
 
 I'm
 

 
 productivity, guess took account major change
 
 manufacturing services 1970s one factors holding
 back productivity. services large part
 economy, would tend cause
 increased rate productivity stabilized, let's say?
 
 MS. ZICKLER.
 
 bulk research done,
 
 discussed earlier, unable pin 1970s.
 

 
 research showed productivity slowed service industries
 well manufacturing industries. pattern slowdown
 least across different types industries,
 unable pin productivity slowdown growing services
 sector. Looking ahead services sector one
 
 growing sectors, I'm sure detract things
 seem important productivity slowdown, however
 undefined may be. technological changes
 could affect services sector well manufacturing.
 MR. ROBERTS. really point coming to.
 think maybe drag productivity services sector
 overcome. Productivity coming services sector.
 lower [productivity the] manufacturing sector also
 [the staff] here--I'm saying think productivity
 estimates low short run anyway.
 question. I'm intrigued expectations effect inflation.
 understand correctly: someone expects inflation, it's
 likely happen regardless policies effect? is,
 person loses job, even though expected inflation, it's
 likely happen although conditions [such as] cause
 unemployed?
 MR. STOCKTON. Certainly, think expectations
 general sense, obviously, price expectations person
 unemployed exerting less influence current wage
 negotiations person employed.
 general feeling level expectations future inflation
 critical determining entire environment wages
 prices determined. situations people
 [negotiations] going three-year contracts form
 expectations inflation three-to-four year horizon.
 businesses making contractual commitments based expectations.
 It's certainly policies influence actual outcome;
 hold policies constant increase everybody's
 inflation expectations 2 3 percent, think would lead
 higher inflation.
 MR. ROBERTS. guess don't see how, inflation
 expectations rise policies place sales can't
 made higher prices, really would affect real inflation.

 So,

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. think, though, result

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 that's right, would also get
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's right.
 guess would say
 slightly better scenario.
 wouldn't want quoted
 seems realistic scenario would

 cyclical recession point would cut inflation rate
 maybe half get 2 3 percent range.
 seems
 that, terms elements accommodated,
 realistic way trying work toward long-run price
 stability.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's examine proposition.
 I'll let Mr. Gramley answer that.
 
 -12-
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. would like ask staff question.
 chance turn exercise head say: Suppose
 walk unemployment rate gradually natural
 rate 1988? results get then? don't think
 going bad, really.
 MR. STOCKTON. fact, done exercise,
 end inflation rate little 4 percent 1988
 unemployment rate would gotten 7 percent
 time.
 MR. GRAMLEY. accept definition price
 stability President Federal Reserve Bank Minneapolis,
 we're almost there.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. surprises little get
 answer based upon numbers. get unemployment rate
 where? natural rate 6-1/2 percent?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 Seven.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. take straight Phillips curve
 approach make rough ballpark calculations, leaving
 happens exchange value dollar, looks
 ought able get [unemployment] even lower that.
 suppose different effect dollar.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. you? unemployment rate
 went steadily, would bound higher inflation rate
 1985, right?
 MR. STOCKTON. That's correct. inflation rate goes
 4-1/2 5 percent '85, back 4-1/2 percent '86,
 4-1/4 percent '87, little 4 percent '88.
 MR. GRAMLEY. You're always natural rate
 unemployment. happening then, reduce extent
 get improvement, speed limit effect.
 speed limit effect case one much
 dispute; everybody believes speed limit hypothesis.
 threw out, would get even better performance.
 MR. PARTEE. May tack Tony's question?
 bothered too. threw number interest rates
 1988 I'm sure heard correctly. thought said 9
 percent funds rate. $120 billion
 improvement budget situation?
 MR. STOCKTON. That's right. actual budget deficits,
 course, still remain fairly high, get much weaker-MR. PARTEE. Yes, it's $120 billion better budget deficit
 otherwise--that is, without change policy occurring.
 there's still 9 percent funds rate 1 percent rate
 inflation? sounds extraordinarily tough.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 -13-
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 MR. BALLES.
 I'd like come back second
 inflation expectation problem that, said, model can't
 incorporate. look today's Bluebook structure
 alternatives alternative alternative C,
 interest rate levels projected show T-bill rate going
 8 8-1/2 percent range alternative slight drop
 long rates.
 alternative C T-bill rate 9-1/4
 9-3/4 percent range slight rise long rates. question
 is:
 Given dramatic drop inflation we've already had,
 holding interest rates levels?
 Might not, fact,

 don't think
 people involved rates.
 might want wait
 another 20 minutes so.
 MR. BALLES.
 
 I'd rather wait, answer

 I'm sorry.

 Mr. Black.

 Suppose want explore opposite. I'm saying would

 MR. KICHLINE. Well, we'll put Mr. Truman spot.
 think one areas potential weakness foreign side.
 Obviously, dollar continues high, raises
 questions performance foreign side. That's one area
 [potential] weakness. Another may well residential construction
 activity. We've seen fluky numbers there--shooting August
 dropping back September. view that's bottom,
 that's necessarily clear. could easily go bit weaker.
 Another dramatic increase business fixed investment,

 statement, isn't that-MR. KICHLINE. No, mentioned that.

 would say it's particularly important context

 many key areas ample world-wide capacity.

 MR. MARTIN. Let ask second question regard
 labor resources. productivity figure indeed low--as
 said innumerable times think is--where leave
 regard unemployment rates?
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, think shorter run
 probably talking higher unemployment rates. It's conceivable
 short run means businesses would adding
 much payrolls projected current forecast. So,
 would expect give us perhaps bit higher unemployment rate

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, conditions Sixth
 District substantially different reported Si Keehn.
 practically every sector, exceptions, we're seeing
 very, robust growth economy--August auto sales, retail

 MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I'd like enter vote
 alternative B. One reason concern regard leadership
 world economy impact world's biggest market
 less developed countries. Speaking domestic basis, though,
 yet back trend line real GNP, described using
 last decade 1973 1980 whatever feel appropriate

 way they're dealing unions, world
 competition vectored country. think
 fine-tuning, considering little know institutions
 financial instruments perform today, would go
 fine-tuning always gone--not fine. So, slight
 firming interest rates so-called precautionary firming, given

 we're going tighten be, humble opinion,
 major tightening--not firming 1/4 3/8 point. I'm

 MR. PARTEE.
 I'm worried open-end nature "or
