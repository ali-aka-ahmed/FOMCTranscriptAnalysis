 keep hear ever

 also mai mean unemploy rate could stickier

 so, base casual talk

 mr. zeisel.
 well, face situat

 compar averag recoveri postwar expans.
 second, period trend rate
 product, least best measur it, weak.
 feel trend product mai 1 percent rang

 earlier postwar period product rate
 normal ran 2-1/2 percent.
 so, sens, we're oper
 around differ slope.
 think two factor plai rather

 so, optimist price side.
 think that's solid. importantli, don't get kind

 mr. ford. excus me, jerri, didn't understand

 optimist--just
 it's messag doesn't work out?

 no, went it.
 said
 attack question inflat rate might primarili

 think
 that's import.
 mr. parte. meant sai didn't realli
 think profit would go 40 percent.
 mr. corrigan.
 mr. parte.
 
 that's right.
 didn't sai that, meant sai it.
 
 chairman volcker. said could go 40 percent
 5 percent 4 percent [inflat]?
 mr. corrigan.
 mr. parte.
 
 no, 5 percent.
 make them, sai, 30, give you--
 
 mr. corrigan. again, assum basic noth special
 oil price. even take staff's estim 8
 percent drop oil price, sens it's shoe-in.
 get
 larger oil price drop, don't know. could get problem
 too.
 mr. martin. point, that's place
 isn't unit labor cost.
 case, expect
 larger oil price drop 8 percent, realiz natur

 chairman volcker. well, let ask question

 mr. boehn.
 
 we'd bad luck food

 mr. rice.

 mr. parte. could also get wage rate went

 [bob]?
 
 mr. black.
 [ye], think there's go big jump

 don't know whether it's 40 percent--that sound awfulli
 high--but think profit ought rise quit rapidli.
 mr. parte.

 we've gone break-even ed

 therefor, high side
