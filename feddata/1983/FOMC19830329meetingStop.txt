 MR. RICE.
 I'd first like compliment Steve think
 unusually clear analysis kinds issues face.

 policy preference course today seems depend usually
 one sees current performance economy one sees
 economy developing near term. one sees economy
 fragile economic recovery vulnerable much weaker
 usual--and, course, sees inflation rate low and,
 therefore, major concern--one obviously would pushed
 direction alternative perhaps even relaxation.
 hand, one sees economy strengthening
 rapidly indeed appears boom momentum
 strong fear uncertainties inflation, obviously one
 might pushed direction alternative C even
 restraint.
 would agree Governor Partee's statement yesterday
 support staff analysis staff forecast,
 found middle.
 would agree says
 rest year real GNP could come 1 percent higher 1
 percent lower.
 staff forecast middle.
 would agree also Frank Morris says
 need data little time confident
 nature recovery. Readily accepting inventories
 lean, shelves bare, defense spending strong
 rising, seems one must make heroic assumptions
 regard consumer expenditures consumers' willingness take
 debt large quantities, given level real interest rates.
 Also [it takes] expansive assumptions respect residential
 construction order see economy recovering strongly
 danger causing boom. think worry economy
 strengthening quickly would ignore best [not]
 minimized.
 drags economy present time:

 drag effects capital spending probable composition
 spending turns around begins expand, drag
 effects state local expenditures well.
 would agree,
 said, need time data feel confident
 nature recovery, point I'm persuaded
 economy still needs nurturing least need
 restraining influence resulting restrictive monetary
 policy. Now, would agree may considerable
 stimulation sense underlying rate growth
 think
 aggregates may well strong.
 see stimulation relative terms, see
 stimulation situation real interest rates negative [and]
 quite sensitive stimulation context highly
 So, would come favor
 positive real rates interest.

 I'm sure it'd premature return targeting even M2

 think would indicated situation reasons

 So, therefore, could achieve
 substantive effect anyway money market directive. I'm
 saying won't point would want return

 could put us back

 I'm little concerned

 Even though may make sense target M2 M3
 --although think M3 would reliable next period
 might consider targeting M3 short period we're
 still seeing substantial movement funds going on--I still think

 MR. STERNLIGHT. said yesterday, President Horn,

 kind reaction would be, occasions I've gotten
 sense intermediate longer end market would take

 occasions whole market reacted. Last
 Friday Kaufman's report came out--and maybe little

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, according staff projection
 does.
 It's entirely different question weight put
 staff projection. staff projection says $200 million come
 growth path. Let refine bit:

 assumption, let presume assumption roughly $250 million.
 tell you, you're sitting [and make
 decision], mechanical assumption sometimes helpful
 might guess errors might
 whether delay today go ahead tomorrow. seems
 obvious point that--if said $250 million, instance,
 running little high--consistent consultation
 anything else, figures come we'd err side
 little $250 million.
 [money] coming low,
 we'd err side $250 million. "erring
 side of" doesn't say that's it's going come out.
 get two errors.
 calculating Desk leans minimize
 course, Manager leans bit toward slightly
 tighter figure coming high slightly lower it's
 coming low. that's encompassed words "generally
 maintain existing degree restraint."
 MR. ROBERTS.

 level interest rates per se?
 MS. TEETERS.
 Well, would like focus level
