 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I've looking
 signs crowding staff projections; don't see
 1984.
 Presumably, nothing done budget deficit,
 reach point total demand credit going
 require reduction housing, apparently going
 take place 1984.
 assume it's corporate financing
 gap, projected negative year, small next
 year. attempted calculate day reckoning
 going it's 1984?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let interject question comment.
 don't understand "either/or" crowding theory.
 seems
 interest rates relatively high deficit
 relatively high there's already crowding sense
 [unintelligible] investment housing.
 MR. MORRIS.
 Well, meant level crowding
 would require substantial reduction housing current
 level.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. MORRIS.

 MR. KICHLINE. Well, don't good answer
 question. would say that, point view, interest rates
 significantly higher would absence
 $200 billion average deficit part government. So,
 You're
 sense, clearly degree crowding out.
 quite correct noting holds forecast together
 seeing really bad things materializing early 1984
 
 10/4/83
 
 strong business picture. is, internal funds generation
 forecast strong; profits growth high. investment,
 growing, simply doesn't match we're seeing business
 side.
 So, combination really foreign sector--foreign
 inflows--plus business savings able offset would
 apparent crowding-out effects.
 You're right forecast
 don't see point collapse housing.
 [Housing demand]
 clearly growing much it's lower one might
 expected otherwise.
 Consumer borrowing, might note, strong
 forecast. Looking now, one problems, seems
 me, reduced business borrowing--the negative
 financing gap--we strong consumer spending consumer
 borrowing forecast.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 Isn't part answer think
 crowding mind set goes back days
 Regulation Q? now, interest rates largely deregulated,
 isn't abrupt point funds simply aren't available; it's
 gradual situation. don't think we're going see fellow
 jump box say:
 I'm Mr. Crowding Out.
 seems it's
 going much gradual.
 Interest rates higher
 otherwise would distortions mix
 GNP; think right now.
 MR. BALLES.
 Mr. Chairman, I'd like add Ed
 said.
 think signs horizon already
 crowding out.
 It's true housing starts nationally continued
 go August, state Oregon, example,
 increased production lumber even face that.
 Sales
 made fairly high levels inventory plant level
 retail level, that's expect corner
 turned near future. look things going
 sales new single-family homes, area
 declines two months row--in July August. lumber
 industry feels becomes harbinger going
 happen near future housing starts.
 housing start

 So,
 even though demand may weakening terms ultimate
 purchases, housing starts continue look solid while.

 think indication sales new single-family homes
 already starting decline, two months row, concrete
 sign squeeze put industry high interest
 rates.

 They've coming down.
 
 MR. MORRIS. answer haven't looked '85

 Pretty clearly, problem going come

 question is:

 MR. RICE. Also, partly support Frank, next
 year we're projecting slight decline long-term interest rates.
 would argue buildup crowding out.

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 speaking long-term--?
 
 MR. RICE. We're projecting decline long-term interest
 rates 1/2 percentage point.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 vary quite bit Wojnilower Kaufman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let ask whether staff gone
 hypothetical scenario tried go through,
 inconclusively. is, next year we're probably going running
 trade deficit $110 billion current account deficit
 $70 $80 billion. happens if, notwithstanding high level
 interest rates, expectations regarding exchange rates change
 radically see exchange rate falling substantially?
 implications reversal--a major reduction complete
 cessation--of net capital inflows. Now, what's effect interest
 rates? analyze it, probably would upward
 movement, would improved differential dollar
 market Eurodollar market would reflows
 Eurodollar market brought banks. composition
 capital movements would change substantially. interest rate
 effect probably would significant home and/or
 would dramatic change exchange rate. want

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, might want separate question

 sure. Whether intervention purchase government securities

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

 MR. TRUMAN. Whenever we're asked question Congress

 MR. PARTEE. again, Steve, want emphasize Ted's

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, Eleventh District
 seeing economy much way Jim outlined it.
 surprise, [economic activity is] coming back little
 stronger probably little faster originally
 anticipated. housing, course, single-family housing
 strong, particularly Dallas/Fort Worth area that's expected
 continue; multifamily housing, we're probably getting
 dangerously overbuilt situation. consumer sales running along
 pretty well. energy seems turnaround. Texas,

 talking crowding whether looking

 1985 going disaster home building. That's
 type terminology using. Then, talking

 So, overall sentiment seems things going along
 well, economy coming back, continue 1984.
 real question mark seems 1985 going be.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. want add think recurring theme

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Gramley.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, two things worry
 staff forecast. One similar wide
 variety forecasts exist private sector. staff
 provided us usual summary forecasts follow-Chase, Wharton, DRI Merrill Lynch--and it's amazing close
 everybody is. Real growth next year ranges 4.2 4.7 percent;
 inflation rates measured deflator somewhat higher
 staff's forecast uniform little 5 percent;
 everybody expects unemployment rate drop somewhere around
 8-1/4 percent end 1984; interest rates expected
 stay maybe go little, certainly
 much standards we've seen recent years. know,
 everybody forecasts thing, something bound wrong.
 something coming along foreseen.
 second thing worries outlook seems
 good true. could lay way want
 reasonably hoped terms course economic
 financial development next year, would hope growth
 rate slows range 4 5 percent--enough make
 progress unemployment rapid growth rate
 generate unusual inflationary pressures. I'd want combination
 developments keeps interest rates
 going little, pushing serious crowding problem
 1985 beyond. I've listened comments around table
 way risks go, sentiment tends
 risks may side. I've asked [that question]
 would assess risks fairly well balanced. would agree
 thing ought worry standpoint
 policy get weaker economy get
 stronger one inflation. get weaker economy,
 feeling would enough pent demand housing
 consumer durable goods that, moderate decline interest
 rates certainly would unwelcome, could keep
 recovery going. got considerably stronger recovery
 inflation began get significant pressures credit
 markets money growing rapidly, would resist.
 would significant problems.
 So, really, hope things
 work way staff forecasts. worry
 recovery might stronger inflation later on.
 MS. TEETERS. want go back Frank Morris' question

 MR. AXILROD.
 
 think technical disputes.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. think disagreement there.
 2 minutes current policy, Mr. Axilrod?
 MR. AXILROD. Well, Mr. Chairman, it's brief since
 aggregates comfortably within ranges. really
 hard time thinking alternatives Committee consider.
 Alternative B, course, based current reserve conditions,
 we've interpreted borrowing centered around $650 million,
 associated funds rate probably around 9-1/4 9-1/2 percent.
 Alternatives C somewhat easier somewhat tighter,
 respectively. even so, degree ease tightening
 presented much push aggregates outside
 long-run ranges; Ml, M2, M3 remain within ranges
 end year. logic presenting alternatives within
 usual structure--where aiming higher money growth leads lower
 interest rates lower money growth higher interest rates--to
 mind yields somewhat anomalous results current circumstances
 unless vast differences opinion staff outlook
 economy demand money. instance, given
 economic outlook, apparent need force money
 ranges significant changes--at least premeditated
 fore-ordained changes--in reserve restraint reserve paths.
 question would seem whether money moving
 range, even it, Committee would wish tighten.
 money moving down, would Committee wish ease
 extent? It's somewhat opposite way specs presented
 logic it. Given much uncertainty still prevails
 meaning aggregates focus policy,
 seems answer policy question still involves
 assessment economy emerging financial conditions. Thus,
 directive structured last two meetings, sentence
 effect serves proviso--permitting reserve adjustments
 faster slower money growth depending economic outlook
 financial conditions--seems appropriate assuming whatever option
 adopted option keeps money growth comfortably within
 range.
