 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let say assembled group,

 So, meeting itself, appropriate

 Let say one thing whole

 MR. WALLICH.
 
 That's stops getting worse.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 MR. ZEISEL.
 
 No, get some--
 
 goes slightly positive, President Solomon.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 why?
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. he's saying current
 account estimate shows worse.
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, that's effect price

 MR. BALLES.
 Jim, I'd like ask question, may,
 federal government share total credit flows,
 [depicted in] lower half first chart Mike Prell
 referred to.
 believe quite bearing outlook
 question specifically, Mike, is:
 interest rates, real nominal.
 anything unified budget deficit?
 is, included off-budget deficits mortgage pools

 MR. PRELL. measurement borrowing U.S.
 Treasury, covers unified deficit off-budget

 MR. BALLES.
 
 right, thank you.
 
 MR. WALLICH. look chart GNP prices

 MR. ZEISEL.
 don't think it's fundamental [difference in]
 unit labor costs trends, although differences views

 may little optimistic
 view productivity some, great deal remain
 rather conservative. view long-term productivity growth

 must say
 staff, evaluating past performance utilizing whatever
 quantitative tools available, tends come rather
 optimistic results inflation outlook--somewhat
 optimistic, fact, incorporated here.
 MS. TEETERS.
 Jerry, non-oil import prices here.
 assumption imported oil prices?
 MR. ZEISEL.
 
 think relatively stable real
 
 terms.
 MR. TRUMAN. No, stable nominal terms,
 mentioned. Essentially, assumption underlying forecast
 oil prices unchanged throughout projection [period];
 built small adjustment slight rise
 something like 50 cents barrel currently recorded figures,
 [reflects] tightening spot [prices].
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back Governor Wallich's
 point:
 forecasters projecting higher rate inflation
 are.
 Certainly, that's feeling financial
 community; looking toward inflation 5 6 percent instead
 around 4 percent.

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. fed back Ted Truman's 15

 MR. KICHLINE. Yes.
 He's causing us difficulty, obviously.
 Without Ted Truman would lower rates inflation!

 That's reason alternative
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. assuming

 MR. MORRIS. You're showing 1984 drop 0.8

 unemployment rate associated 4.2 percent real growth rate.
 staff suggests rather large drop unemployment
 rate historically 4.2 percent real growth rate.
 assuming labor force growth dropping sharply it?
 MR. ZEISEL. No, labor force growth doesn't drop sharply;
 actually, increases quite bit. feel 4-1/4 percent
 increase GNP close 2 percent capacity growth

 historically reasonable using something like Okun's law

 MR. MORRIS.
 it's high.
 
 Really?
 
 matter fact, staff thinks

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. low productivity growth

 MR. ZEISEL.

 MR. KICHLINE. Well, could say something, maybe Steve
 Paul would want comment interpretation markets

 MR. AXILROD. President Balles, even years ago short

 think it's somewhat surprising,

 So, private spending wouldn't

 MR. MEEK. I'd add one market factor,
 Treasury third quarter, example, selling $60

 MR. BALLES.
 Well, that's right. comes back

 that's keeping share up.
 Mike? that, turn, could effect keeping interest

 MR. BOEHNE. wouldn't argue higher rates 1984

 MR. PARTEE. Well, GNP increase large

 runaway boom strike low, largely

 MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, technical point,

 Well, would rebase right June.

 MR. PARTEE. would rebase use 4 8 percent,

 could total credit, total credit problem
 it's hard estimate current numbers. might use
 confirmation, but-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let suggest something great
 hesitancy I'm sure like visually substantively
 gives easy explanation:
 Make range 5 9 percent say
 9 percent allows change velocity
 expansion. Maybe that's new trend things want allow
 possibility. 5 percent allows fairly normal,
 almost normal, cyclical change velocity on. that's
 precisely picked 5 9 percent, 9 percent allows
 change velocity 5 percent allows sizable
 change velocity. still leaves open much weight put
 it, picked 5 9 percent covers probable
 range uncertainty see velocity.
 MR. PARTEE.
 GNP, right?
 
 So, mind 9 percent nominal
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, consistent
 nominal GNP growth predicting. Precisely.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 rebased, Mr. Chairman?
 
 -47-
 
 7/12-13/83
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 [Unintelligible.]
 starting
 point:
 going presenting forecast roughly 9 percent
 bit 9 percent nominal GNP next year, relate
 that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let ask question. Even though
 prefer 5 9 percent 4 8 percent, certainly terms
 immediate market effect, feasible say we're coming
 5 9 percent yet going continue deemphasizing it?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 don't particularly like showing
 high range that's reservation it, see
 rather pat explanation given--precisely:
 projected, roughly,
 9 percent nominal GNP growth next year, gentlemen. think
 implication satisfactory outcome. feel
 midst velocity changes continuing sort can't
 quite identify--or may say we're putting full weight
 Ml.
 Based upon everything we've seen far assuming we're
 period expansion, think it's likely velocity pattern
 change greatly would actually get bigger
 increase Ml nominal GNP, that's
 picked 9 percent top.
 5 percent allows less
 normal, much less normal, increase velocity
 particular cyclical period.
 So, kind span best
 range uncertainty have.
 MR. BALLES.
 
 That's good idea.
 
 MR. WALLICH. seems say accepting
 causal influence goes GNP M1 there's counterflow causality.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 don't think quite said that. may
 sounded way worded it. word
 way:
 change velocity, 9 percent would
 appropriate [number].
 gets causality way.
 change velocity, would want lower M1
 that's lower end [at 5 percent].
 MR. WALLICH. looking target, suppose M1
 growing 9 percent unfortunately velocity growing 4
 percent, could. see problem
 target.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 would high.
 
 like real target nominal GNP.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, would saying implicitly
 4 percent velocity growth may know
 ex post.
 That's problem. thought getting that,
 9 percent high.
 MS. HORN. might know ex post least would
 4 months ex post, half year year ex post. So, it's
 shortening period uncertainty.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm attracted simply think

 MR. KEEHN. complicate it, use 5

 return normal pattern get 1984 might
 contemplate reduction go back 4 8 percent?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 That's kind fine-tuning uncertain
 
 period.
 MS. TEETERS. could even mention target
 1984 see end year may
 well rebase [Ml growth] doesn't come down.
 certainly velocity changes still going on.
 MR. ROBERTS.
 
 don't talk next year,
 
 Paul?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. talk next year; don't
 necessarily give M1 target. didn't give one
 year, don't see much reason give one next year.
 say don't pay much attention it, but-MR. PARTEE. seems principle one
 state then, course, it's subject review evidence
 comes velocity fact doing.
 MR. CORRIGAN. 5 9 percent sounds nice don't
 like partly think risks are.
 strong sympathy way, I'd rather see us rebase June
 use 4 8 percent, would give practical result anyway.
 really think saying 5 9 percent context everything
 that's going on, least look it, troubling.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. going great trouble getting
 whole
 central tendency look numbers.
 bunch high level bunch lower level there's
 nothing between. worked pretty well last time,

 MR. BLACK. may explain part different

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. central tendency nominal GNP

 percent. 10 people 9-1/2 10 percent, roughly,
 11 people 9-1/2 10.2 percent.
 So, guess say
 central tendency roughly 9-1/2 10 percent.
 MR. BLACK. Well, cut 9 percent 8
 percent assuming little pickup velocity rather change.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 think would say 4 8
 percent event assuming little increase
 velocity.
 MR. BLACK. could stress point Jerry made
 minute ago way, unreasonable thing assume.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually 4 percent would give 5-1/2
 percent increase velocity; that's pretty high even historical
 standards.
 MR. ROBERTS.
 

 
 thought 6 percent.
 
 MR. AXILROD. Well, talking second half
 '83, get '84, second year probably-MR. CORRIGAN.
 
 It's quite high.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. BLACK.

 don't know.
 
 Maybe I'm beginning like
 
 could go 10 percent assume small drop
 
 MR. WALLICH. seems mainly accommodative much
 less leaning pressures.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's look we're saying 4
 8 percent.
 take average forecasts, we're saying
 expect velocity plus 6 plus 2. want
 adjust 4 8 percent would say plus 5 plus 1?
 That's difference.
 MR. WALLICH. could period somewhat rising
 interest rates, possibly, would accelerate velocity.
 cyclical pattern certainly one velocity gain.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, would allow
 velocity gain. midpoint would plus 3 4 velocity gain.
 MR. CORRIGAN.
 
 Mr. Chairman, look velocity
 
 historically, though, think potential rise velocity
 related directly actual decline velocity.
 balances sitting can't ignore them.
 
 -50-
 
 7/12-13/83
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. saying velocity may rise
 normal cyclical pattern?
 
 yes.
 
 MR. CORRIGAN. think distinct possibility,
 can't ignore money that's sitting there.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 think risks lie.
 
 MR. CORRIGAN.
 
 That's think lie.
 
 MR. WALLICH. compared old range
 2-1/2 5-1/2 percent, people aren't going keep mind
 different Ml.
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, I'm starting point
 I'd like preserve M1 time becomes important
 informationally. discussion reinforced view
 shouldn't rebase moment. shouldn't talking 5
 9 percent anything else gives much credence
 numbers anybody around table able assign
 them, least consensus. thus seems
 drop back use 7 11 percent, recognizes
 overshoot first half can't explain don't know
 going happen second half. 11 percent top
 suggests anybody chooses figure out--and monetarists
 market people others so--about 6-1/2 increase
 remainder year. view uncertainty, isn't
 unreasonable. result, would go 7 11 percent
 without rebasing maybe talk sometime future.
 [for 1984] I'd go 4 8 percent, established February

 February 1984.

 So, elevate

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, think say anyway
 next year. official less different than-MR. GUFFEY. sure, uncertainty involved velocity

 about--one rebasing establishing 5 9 percent range
 trying explain remainder 1983--seems
 elevating beyond point I'd like see.

 MR. ROBERTS. gone 11 percent rate

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, ranges allows

 MR. BOEHNE.
 think there's something Roger says.

 nobody really knows enough M1 confident.
 could
 say next year Ml range 4 8 percent assumes

 say it--and say doesn't work, we'll simply
 adjust Ml again. strikes conveying notion

 MR. CORRIGAN.
 
 broader aggregates don't really
 
 provide much mechanism--or provided much
 mechanism--to permit this.
 
 MR. MORRIS.
 
 Ml has?
 
 MR. CORRIGAN. use it; don't to. I'm
 saying would. practical matter, give us
 opportunity move think move. that's I'm
 concerned about--having set targets gives us flexibility
 even though may use it.
 MR. PARTEE. agree Jerry. think ought rebase,
 I'm scared 5 9 percent I'd fuzz little
 velocity say keeping open.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 Would base June, then?
 
 MR. PARTEE. Sure. think concept
 happened unusual. we're going following Ml
 expectation small rise velocity.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. whole spectrum short-term
 interest rates really behaving though fed funds rate
 closer 9-1/2 percent 9-1/8 percent rate last

 MR. PARTEE.
 
 said I'd base June.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Basing June seems awfully fussy
 
 me.
 
 MR. PARTEE. it's basing are,

 MR. GRAMLEY. get lot way money growth; that's

 So, think Jerry's suggestion basing June makes good sense
 don't think ought constrain much.
 use 4 8 percent sounds better. Cosmetically,
 sounds better. think finesse business velocity

 MR. GRAMLEY. Well, would go borrowing figure
 somewhere around $800 million probably, $850 million. I'd like
 see federal funds rate hit around 9-1/2 percent. wouldn't want

 That's I'd be. want

 lean away automaticity. feel would need rebase

 MR. GRAMLEY. agree too; long-run range
 would use 4 8 percent based June.
 MR. WALLICH. could go alternative B shaded little
 low side--not far $1 billion borrowed reserves 10
 percent funds rate. I'd use lower limits--$850 million 93/4 percent.
 MS. TEETERS. going show 7 11 percent range
 [for fed funds]? going come strong signal:
 we're raising rates whole percentage point range
 quite bit.
 
 7/12-13/83

 MR. WALLICH. Well, we're supposedly 6 10
 percent range funds 9-1/4 percent.
 MS. TEETERS. Well, find difficult accept
 tightening. didn't approve tightening last time
 don't think need point. haven't time,
 pointed out, get effect mortgage market
 automobile industry done already. economy,
 two quarters recovery, doesn't strike one
 needs lot restraint. it's also one fairly
 typical. typically get quarter like this. get
 recovery start tightening again; let get back
 something close normal. I'd go alternative keep
 free reserves minus special factors like seasonal range
 maybe $200 $250 million dollars net borrowed.
 MR. RICE. would support that. think we've already
 good deal tightening. know people think it's minuscule;
 think it's significant point recovery. would
 time want damp recovery I'm yet sure
 strong. may well strong many think is,
 would like surer would want wait bit
 tighten further. I'd want wait least another month
 two.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I'm closer Emmett
 Nancy's view, think would perfectly reasonable
 compromise something neighborhood initial borrowing
 assumption of, say, $700 million. don't see expectations
 going change, [borrowing] would give us modest
 lift rates think would consistent, Steve
 pointed out--at least think expressed view--with targets
 alternative A. don't think funds range significant;
 way we're running monetary policy days, we're going touch
 either extreme anyway. So, don't think it's important whether
 leave 6 10 percent not. think might well leave
 it.
 MR. GUFFEY. would join view borrowing level
 $700 million thereabouts. suggests validate
 happened past; funds rate roughly 9-1/8
 9-1/4 percent range potential high 9-1/2 percent might fall
 $700 million borrowing level. would oppose going much
 higher $700 million point.
 MR. KEEHN. I'd inclined toward alternative B. I'd
 feel comfortable fed funds rate 9-1/2 percent maybe
 touch higher. $750 $800 million borrowing level would
 accomplish that, think that's I'd comfortable.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. ought change Districts!
 theory regional system reflect view
 Districts. not.
 MR. ROBERTS. think Si's view would be.
 Alternative B closer would like see: funds rate
 9-1/2 10 percent borrowing somewhere around $800 million

 MR. BOYKIN. would support "B," pretty much reasons

 MR. FORRESTAL. would support alternative B, Mr.Chairman.
 would look something perhaps lower end of-that range
 reasons you've already expressed--namely, we're looking
 much robust recovery anticipated monetary growth
 strong. major question facing Committee, seems
 me, long allow monetary aggregates continue
 grow without raising inflationary expectations. So, it's question
 much restraint needs put system. view would
 little tightening required time,
 alternative B specifications would fit that. would say would
 look borrowing around $800 million level, funds
 rate somewhere 9-1/2 10 percent.
 MR. BOEHNE. preference alternative A, reasons
 stated. However, would find acceptable "A minus," would
 $700 million borrowing 9-1/4 percent funds rate.
 MR. MARTIN. would support Chairman's $600 $800
