 these, effect, would let miss deposit, strong weak

 would like add word two.
 mr. sternlight. well, think steve summar note
 came us. littl would add point
 still would have, assum, nonborrow reserv target
 reserv period. would see remain central focu
 desk activ. two-week rather on-week period,
 perspect would chang somewhat, think main focu would

 would probabl give attent profil excess

 look weekli reserv level, wouldn't need
 strive meet individu weekli target.
 probabl would want avoid sizabl accumul excess

 mr. boehn. sens much

 mr. sternlight. think might depend on respond

 mr. axilrod. two problem look at.
 longer reserv period on week; two-week period. right

 februari?
 mr. axilrod. reserv mainten period begin thursdai,
 4th deposit it's tuesdai, 2nd februari.
 mr. parte.
 so, we're talk someth could
 receiv attent next meet, think.
 chairman volcker. well, littl problem here,
 seem me.
 occur better tell market
 we're do; littl statement. don't know
 we're go come statement next meet.
 mr. gramlei. on problem analysi

 seem impli we're look ml princip target.
 world crr we're continu
 i'm wonder is:

 mr. parte. go comment, too.
 give us opportun pai attent nonborrow

 seem requir determin committe

 that's ask
 also, figur

 mai suspect while, given [new] procedur that.
 peter said set nonborrow reserv now,
 impress set borrow,
 nonborrow reserv. realli set nonborrow reserv
 again, contemporan ran off, would put pressur
 discount window, typic mode oper
 vote put contemporan reserv.
 so, think need
 consid context.
 guess i'm much
 anyth remind committe on decis need

 would ask
 mr. ball.
 that's good point, chuck.
 question:
 went back approxim equal [weight]
 scenario year ago, would take care
 might take care what-of problem we're rais, would it?
 half?
 mr. parte.
 think propos, understood
 staff, might start let 25 percent
 overshoot undershoot show automat might

 mr. axilrod. sum, problem analyz m2
 think automat respons, none

 so, anyth committe want
 m2--that m2 weak committe want move

 adjust m2.
 
 particular week could make
 
 mr. axilrod. sure can. there's question it.
 point wasn't uniqu relat

 mr. parte. that's thought suggest 25 percent-to give weight overwhelm weight ml behavior.
 mr. axilrod. that's right. on

 alwai done that.
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, don't make chang

 ml.
 don't want repeat presid black said; i'd like

 purpos
 go ask question, steve:
 better control monei suppli, wouldn't better
 target total reserv?
 think [exercis] reduc
 flexibl rather wai around. problem
 see increas volatil interest rate,
 think market would adjust readili.
 mr. axilrod. well, everi multipli adjust
 right, would probabl case. don't normal get mix
 even monei suppli type deposit--those small bank
 larg bank--exactli right. so, tend throw us off.
 mr. robert. multipli differ gener
 short term, though, aren't thei?
 mr. axilrod. ye, that's right; might averag through.
 technic side, studi coupl year ago-befor contemporan reserv, even tri
 allow it--seem suggest, surprisingli, nonborrow

 reserv requir type demand deposit. reduc
 zero, small
 variabl. three class now:

 surpris total reserv would [not] quit well
 think would.
 
 12/19-20/83
 
 mr. robert. i'm think target recent month
 actual experi wonder control.
 mr. black. steve, get close point
 chairman volcker rais ago. two kind demand
 deposit [not] normal ml: govern
 deposit interbank deposit. would think on could pretti well
 estim go extend period time;
 least littl work i've done suggest that. insofar
 shift larg bank small bank [ar concern], ye,
 short run import; long run wouldn't
 think realli mess us much. whole thing
 design--at least i've perceiv wai i'm sure other
 also wouldn't [been adopt]--to control ml becaus,
 mention, that's aggreg subject
 contemporan reserv requir. rest, m2 m3,

 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. boehn.
 
 mr. boehn. well, seem ought us
 exist crr reason go m1 go ml.
 ought give less weight ml depend judgment
 good intermedi target is. crr mean end;
 seem argument backward sai

 probabl case treat ml foot m2 m3--not

 two. so, think case give equal weight. give
 nearli equal weight equal weight, case
 degre automat, strike someth like 25
 percent bad wai start. it's reason blend

 mr. corrigan. well, almost everybodi know, never

 never thought would make much differ term well
 could control ml even decid want control m1
 noth els. agre mr. boehn's point, howev,
 logic prior decis want ml.

 quit apart that, must sai hunch we're go
 end [interest rate] variabl steve peter seem
 expect. that's hunch; can't prove either, think
 that's wai thing go go--that we're go
 nois littl improv control ml.
 so,
 realli druther, i'd drop whole thing. don't think

 mr. axilrod. that's right! next week ml

 don't think it's go weak suggest could
 yesterdai-mr. martin.

 mr. parte.
 i'm greatli concern 9 percent nomin
 work out.
 gnp number fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. think it's on
 far see, figur staff given us
 kei on.
 pretti consist 9 percent gnp number. so, think
 target growth rate specifi 1984 ballpark.
 ought term think would produc
 would consist 9 percent gnp growth.
 regardless happen next year, though, realli
 think 1985 go problem. third
 that's
 year recoveri--if recoveri last year.
 recoveri get pretti old; it's get time
 inflationari pressur get greater. certainli go
 time pressur credit market ought grow
 increas privat demand. would agre lyle role
 deficit realli affect credit market condit
 affect economi whole, pluse
 minus fiscal polici mai short run least
 offset. so, see year 1985 develop on
 mai credit-crunch type condit--and gener
 forecast market--do want sai we're go
 reduc growth rate aggreg
 concept long-run non-inflationari environ, thu ensur
 doubt want
 credit crunch 1985?
 sai that.
 so, would avoid specif number 1985
 reason, want give much encourag possibl
 hope might fiscal action 1985
 over. again, seem extrem unlik big
 fiscal move take effect first part '85; might take
 don't know
 effect spring summer '85.
 time would be, even fiscal polici action--except
 seem unlik would begin
 year--that make extrem difficult state kind polici
 tradeoff. so, wouldn't specifi anyth '85.
 think ml done quit lot better peopl

 certainli true doesn't look [consist with] gnp number,
 that's doesn't stabil characterist
 m2 m3 total credit make glide along

 sai, nanci, m2 9 percent everi year, good bad,
 so, can't sai

 would adopt staff's propos, guess pretti

 would quiet specif number 1985.
 on point:
 want agre ed boehn
 don't think expect make progress everi year rate
 inflat anyhow. think look full cycl
 process. keep inflat rate acceler much
 beyond 5 percent, certainli keep acceler beyond 6
 percent cours cycl, go zero
 next recess. we'll much better postur
 much less inflationari cycl next time around.
 don't think
 it's reason sai 4-1/2 percent inflat forecast
 next year 1985 we'll bring 4 percent 1986
 3-1/2 percent 1987 3 percent. can't that.

 dynam economi won't permit it.
