 [Without objection.]
 MR. ZEISEL.

 Yes, think were.

 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, Bill Ford happen
 question, found out. Jerry, referred
 fixed weight deflator. Board staff forecast officially, least
 version see here, uses implicit deflator. referring
 first quarter year, implicit deflator rising
 5.8 percent annual rate CPI WPI either flat
 declining, getting major different signals
 
 5/24/83
 
 really happening inflation front. So, technical question
 staff, Jerry, is:
 different indicators price
 movements consider meaningful?
 MR. ZEISEL. Well, lower one, always lower one!
 deflator first quarter distorted sharp swings
 net exports, particularly importation fuels,
 sharply. expect figure move back line second
 quarter. think CPI fixed weight price index
 better measure happening fundamental price movements
 first quarter. quite good indeed;
 2 3 percent range.
 MR. FORD. military procurement prices?
 Procurement picking up. captured
 indexes one really captures
 government paying defense [spending]?
 MR. ZEISEL.
 MR. FORD.
 
 Theoretically, capture it.
 WPI ought capture it.
 
 MR. ZEISEL. Yes, should. attempt certainly made
 capture actual increases prices. deflator bit
 sensitive shifts weights. rising increases
 proportion defense spending would affect index somewhat more.
 actually last half year defense spending
 lagged. increase since third quarter last
 year, rather expecting surge outlays
 supposed big year procurement.
 MR. FORD.
 I'm hearing government really
 paying spare parts things like capacity
 produce run lot specialized activities.

 
 hear anything like that--that now's time selling nuts
 bolts government?
 MR. ZEISEL. seems sad capacity way prices
 run sharply capacity prices run sharply.
 sounds like Catch-22 situation. hadn't heard particular
 argument.
 MR. BOEHNE. don't fundamental disagreement
 Jerry's forecast. done usual good job; however,
 seem least subtle shift
 direction errors might be. last meeting would
 agreed Greenbook, thinking
 Greenbook wrong, perhaps would less growth.
 seems risks shifted. think Greenbook
 right wrong, probably growth.
 comes particular point recovery dynamics
 recovery set it's somewhat greater individual sectors
 housing, consumption, etc. get sense dynamics
 work. One sign look recovery business
 people stop complaining high [interest] rates start
 saying: don't keep things way are?
 start saying that, means things getting better don't
 want anybody rock boat. dominant theme
 
 5/24/83
 
 I've hearing. think period
 dynamics really beginning take hold.
 MR. RICE. Jerry, think heard say expansion
 next year half 1984 would [at rate]
 median previous expansions. Would still say,
 light present data have, strength
 recovery far postwar average significantly?
 MR. ZEISEL. Yes. first year get major kick
 output projections fall short average first
 year recovery; it's 70 percent so. projections make
 sense second year average recoveries begin
 lose steam maintaining rate
 increase second year first. increases
 4-3/4 percent first second year recovery.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's year you're
 talking about. thought saw pictures yesterday said
 recovery far average.
 MR. ZEISEL. Well, [only] first quarter; I'm
 addressing projections first year.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose address first
 six months, recognizing projections?
 MR. ZEISEL. thing date, Mr. Chairman,
 first quarter rather modest increase 2-1/2
 percent, well typical rate.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 auto sales figures.
 
 industrial production
 
 MR. ZEISEL. Incorporating first second quarters
 together probably brings us fairly close average.
 MR. PARTEE. monthly figures, remember Jerry,
 plotted shaded area. less middle.
 MR. ZEISEL. industrial production employment--the
 figures monthly data--that's correct. They're
 really quite consistent average recovery point.
 MR. BLACK. Jerry, exclude CCC payments
 fourth quarter also first quarter get final
 demand roughly magnitude quarters make
 allowance point John Balles made possible
 overstatement implicit price deflator, wouldn't look good
 deal stronger? would look somewhat stronger average
 looked average made adjustments, wouldn't it?
 MR. ZEISEL. recall, excluding CCC gets
 something neighborhood 3 3-1/2 percent last
 couple quarters. don't GNP excluding CCC; final
 sales excluding CCC. 3.3 percent fourth quarter, 3
 percent first quarter, we're [estimating] 2.7 percent
 second quarter.
 
 5/24/83
 
 MR. BLACK. fact point John raised
 validity, we're inclined think does, made
 adjustments, would think real final sales may well higher
 first quarter fourth quarter.
 MR. ZEISEL. Well, final sales certainly stronger
 first quarter one makes adjustment certainly weaker
 fourth quarter CCC outlays enormously high
 fourth quarter.
 So, get somewhat stable pattern.
 Final
 sales trail bit projection second quarter largely
 net export situation. Basically it's situation,
 depending take out, seem get pattern that's
 reasonably stable, excluding CCC, around 3 percent last
 several quarters.
 MR. GUFFEY. Jerry, part forecast beyond second
 quarter premised weakness dollar. kind
 factors taking consideration project dollar
 indeed weaken later 1983 1984?
 MR. ZEISEL.
 
 think I'll let Mr. Truman answer; it's
 
 forecast.
 MR. TRUMAN. I'd say right front, Mr. Guffey,
 clearly room skepticism element
 forecast. forecasting year current account deficit
 $35 billion, would twice rate we've ever
 before, end year current account deficit $60
 billion, would four times [highest] annual rate we've
 ever before. sense market look
 numbers sort, start coming latter part
 year, trade deficits $70 billion per month
 annual rate, say unsustainable
 corrections. predicate much,
 way, terms trade United States falling relative
 abroad otherwise.
 One argue kinds forecasts,
 high relative market forecasts conventional

 forecasts, range people talk about.
 Administration relatively similar forecasts
 sense talking people market,
 less made public.
 although know economists forecasting numbers,
 they're going react sense
 see them. Sam noted report, fact current
 account moved back toward zero something like $7 billion
 annual rate something $20 billion second half
 1982, largely oil many respects spurious
 factor, one reason dollar least short run
 stayed quite strong. factor has, anything, moved
 direction short run.
 would make one comment. Much
 change net exports second quarter resumption
 oil imports and, fact, two surprising things first
 quarter decline oil imports, obviously

 fully anticipate, remarkable growth non-oil imports.
 look numbers, really big numbers--and [sparked]
 oil, dropped $20 billion annual rate--if anything,

 think one looks going past six

 MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, regard near term,
 I'm inclined view we'll probably better staff
 forecast terms real growth maybe even terms inflation.
 I'm nearly sanguine 1984, certainly. think
 reasons Mr. Martin Mr. Solomon suggested
 international front, we're means woods there.
 addition that, must say looking budget process

 real progress made so-called structural deficit-maybe some, certainly nothing write home about. top
 think recognize lot pent
 pressure raise prices. think we're going able
 avoid manifestation pressure, perhaps period time,
 simply productivity/unit labor cost phenomenon working
 almost perfectly right now. That's going last forever. So,
 say, near term looks fine, I'm sure 1984.
 And, looking staff's implied forecast, gets little hard
 imagine 1984 really keep interest
 rates underlying conditions are.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Roberts.
 
 MR. ROBERTS. think I'll wait monetary discussion.
 want respond Tony. disagree 100 percent.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Anybody else?
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES. One question, Mr. Chairman. certainly
 share feeling around table business outlook
 clearly better time time last meeting. It's
 certainly true West. I'm getting little concerned, though,
 inflation outlook whether favorable
 staff forecast it. I'd like turn again, Jerry,
 one. staff optimistic people are. hope
 you're right. understand forecast deflator
