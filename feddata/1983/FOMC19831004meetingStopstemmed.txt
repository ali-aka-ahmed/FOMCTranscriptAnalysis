 mr. parte.
 
 vari quit bit wojnilow kaufman.
 
 vice chairman solomon. let ask whether staff gone
 hypothet scenario tri go through,
 inconclus. is, next year we're probabl go run

 implic revers--a major reduct complet

 mr. truman. well, might want separ question

 think continu there.
 composit effect. whether would take form flow
