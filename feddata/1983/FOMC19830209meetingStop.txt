 MR. AXILROD. Governor Teeters, old Ml last year grew 3-1/4

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 You're probably right.
 
 MR. AXILROD. One easy way get say

 income interest rates last year, said Ml would

 So,

 new M1 increased 8-1/2

 MR. AXILROD.
 Well, top mild sense is.

 So, it's
 is, 11.8 percent, within 9 13 percent range.
 1.2 points top range.
 point estimate 6-1/2

 So,
 relative 9-1/2 percent it's 0.6 point top

 terms distance top range.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 
 Yes.

 MR. AXILROD.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 that's arithmetic sense.
 you've allowed 1 point continued

 MR. AXILROD.
 
 February-to-March, that's right.
 
 MR. PARTEE.
 Well, don't know 1 point; could

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. second question is:

 Let's look one one, that's

 Let's look M2.
 
 2/8-9/83
 
 MR. GRAMLEY. One way handling binding aspects
 widen range make 6 10 percent, extending upper
 limit. additional virtue maintaining lower
 limit last year.
 MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, might say put
 ranges way, weren't centered midpoint.
 reason previous year FOMC established range
 said expected growth around upper end.
 reason
 simply didn't suggest ranges set midpoints thought
 range would accommodate lower growth possible.
 So, set midpoints M2.
 MR. PARTEE.
 Steve, read footnote connected

 Another way saying
 he's saying is:

 saying monetize debt matter big is.
 MR. GRAMLEY. Monetizing debt sense, Bill, would
 mean taking limits I'm arguing that.
 It's question
 particular numbers appropriate,
 disagreement whether 8 11 percent 9 12 percent
 appropriate.
 Arguing raising limits one percentage point
 means monetizing debt seems bit extreme.
 MR. WALLICH. Well, targets would

 There's way getting around saying

 MR. GRAMLEY. I'm arguing we're dealing
