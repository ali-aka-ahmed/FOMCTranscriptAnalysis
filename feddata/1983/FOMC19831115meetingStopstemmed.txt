 chairman volcker. real perform.
 [decid on] long-run [monetari] target next year soon
 present [econom] project.
 propos
 present project 1988, happen coincid
 [the period cover in] last tabl [distribut
 present].
 we're yet oblig that; don't know
 whether time get around present longrang project. we're go decid
 collect look situat. staff pretti sharp
 declin m2 1984 get track [toward price stabil].
 go year?
 mr. stockton. m2 price stabil case 6 percent
 that's project 1984 8 percent increas
 annual rate.
 mr. parte. understand sai product
 growth 1 percent higher--that is, 2 percent rather 1 percent-that unemploy rate associ long-term project
 would point lower?
 mr. stockton. that's correct. that's assum
 2 percent product growth rate, unemploy rate could fall
 8.1 percent end 1984 would stai 7-3/4
 percent rate throughout last four year price stabil
 scenario.
 mr. parte.
 bit higher?
 mr. stockton.
 mr. parte.
 output per worker?
 mr. stockton.
 mr. parte.
 
 would mean total output would quit
 ye.
 
 that's correct.
 
 lower unemploy
 
 that's correct.
 see.
 
 mr. gramlei. i'd like ask increas gnp
 deflat 1985.
 take 6-1/2 percent natur rate [of
 unemploy] we're 2 percentag point '84
 '85, get us, accord formula, 1-1/2
 percentag point reduct inflat per year.
 offset
 drop averag unemploy rate 9-1/2 8-1/2
 '83 '84; add quarter percentag
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 point inflat rate. so, balanc, on would think
 '85 ought come 1 1-1/4 percentag point lower
 inflat rate '84. go up.
 [explain]?
 mr. stockton. ye. differ exchang rate
 behav quit differ. price stabil case still
 depreci exchang rate come account

 mr. gramlei.
 
 thank you.
 
 mr. parte. you've taken fairli restrict definit
 price stabil. sensit last tabl that?
 said price stabil 1-1/2 percent someth like instead

 chairman volcker.
 mr. parte.
 
 see toler ar!
 
 case get [price stabil]
 
 1987.
 mr. stockton. well, coupl thing keep
 mind price stabil [scenario] we're present.
 first thing next two year think we're face
 coupl hurdl go make difficult reach price
 stabil: food price shock go show
 1984 substanti increas social secur tax.
 chairman volcker.
 
 big that?
 
 mr. stockton. account 0.4 percent
 compens four quarter 1984. so, that's almost half
 point ad back onto compens. depreci
 dollar case examin
 momentum recoveri move 1984. so, spend first two
 year almost case keep lid special
 factor think tend boost inflat '84 '85.
 even case we're present achiev price
 deceler realli last three year. so, get
 deceler occur three year spend first
 two year--the next two year--hold thing think
 apt boost inflat. either case cost, obvious,
 less higher make target rate inflat end
 period. requir fairli low rate growth,
 particularli next two year.
 mr. corrigan. end period we're shoot
 for, sai, 1-1/2 percent, would loos translat sai
 could afford 1 percent per year real growth? or, what's
 order magnitud?
 speaker(?). done exercis specif
 would guess would margin lower unemploy
 path averag compar on here.

 recess. last time realli knock inflat head
 1950s three recess 8-year period
 go earli 60s. so, question is: recess
 term bring inflat term real
 variabl?
 mr. stockton. well, think recess obvious get
 inflat rate much faster. you're right it's
 difficult model project busi cycl. earlier
 reduct output immedi effect
 lower inflat. then, lower inflat expect
 subsequ period sharp contract output could
 lead substanti reduct inflat would bring

 mr. stockton. gradual, ye. it's straight line,
 like put ruler piec paper; gradual.
 mr. parte.
 
 someth like 5,5,4,3, 2 percent?

 mr. stockton.
 
 [5.5,

 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. forrest.
 
 mr. forrest. want observ gut
 reaction real gnp project perhap underst,
 especi 1984.
 realli want ask question
 deficit reduct. kind assumpt make deficit
 reduct 1985?
 mr. stockton.
 baselin price stabil scenario
 assum start 1985 equal cut made tax
 govern expenditur, accumul $15 billion tax $15
 billion expenditur.
 so, get $30 billion first year, $60
 billion next year, $90 billion follow year, $120
 billion follow year.
 chairman volcker. remark give
 present inflat never mention deficit,
 hundr eighti million peopl think there's
 relationship.
 mr. rice.
 
 it's there.
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 mr. kichlin.
 mention.
 
 didn't focu that, it's certainli
 
 mr. rice. part question want ask.
 feasibl monetari polici consist progress
 reduc deficit?
 certainli is.
 
 requir--
 
 mr. stockton.
 
 ye.
 
 mr. corrigan.
 
 don't want hear it.
 
 mr. rice.
 
 feasibl on, doabl on?
 
 mr. stockton. ye. fact fiscal action taken,
 make bit easier achiev price stabil. now, reason
 cut deficit lead exchang rate effect
 effect interest rate. smaller deficit lead
 lower interest rate effect depreci
 dollar, lead higher inflat, offset
 less output. so, fact, unemploy path need
 achiev price stabil, assum fiscal action, would
 0.2 percentag point year lower we-vice chairman solomon. don't agre that,
 point current account deficit get larger larger
 larger, huge leap, we'll see higher interest rate. it's
 go prevent chang--some depreci dollar.
 mr. truman. that's precis correct, think. let
 make two point presid solomon. on extent
 built baselin project depreci
 dollar price stabil, essenti, would view part
 process got dollar strong build big
 current account deficit. fact don't much built
 necessari keep current account deficit
 current rang. so, therefor, possibl could go
 further, mr. stockton mention talk
 exogen factor--exogen outsid current
 predict--be part process. sens part
 pai price good luck dollar
 appreci dollar gotten earlier
 acceler short-run process disinfl.
 revers itself, lag come system get much
 more. would regard project sens neutral
 agnost extent doesn't involv big
 buildup current account. that's true baselin
 project. similarli, doesn't involv much correct
 valu dollar; given rel moder growth
 rest world get big improv
 current account period. sens would sai
 it's somewhat agnost wai take-vice chairman solomon. let ask question you.
 answer governor rice would easier achiev price
 stabil didn't get rid budget deficit
 higher interest rate effect higher dollar, also
 assum major recess?
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 mr. stockton. no.
 output path associ
 on here. would basic same; there's differ.
 it's fairli uniform, ad output along case given.
 chairman volcker. understand correctli,
 assumpt reduc deficit it's bad inflat?
 mr. stockton.
 
 that's correct.
 
 mr. kichlin.
 think we've cautiou present
 issu respect inflat expect, that's
 on presum channel influenc term deficit
 action feed back inflat expect.
 model simpli
 doesn't captur that.
 think dave state that.
 so, it's
 area expect model model weak
 offer someth posit term potenti outcom.
 chairman volcker. it's agnost point mr.
 solomon rais whether deficit
 nice smooth path?
 mr. truman. particular point achiev
 better outcom 1988 [unintellig] defin wai extent
 differ fiscal/monetari [polici] mix period give
 higher interest rate, higher dollar, larger current
 account deficit.
 so, likewis, might look beyond 1988
 would go backward correct process.
 would work harder term
 correct felt kind current account deficit would
 sustain extend period time. so, would
 pai price later that.
 chairman volcker. much level interest rate
 affect inflat forecast?
 mr. stockton. well, level interest rate plai
 small role cost capit effect, capit 35
 percent.
 don't think that's major effect short-run price
 determin.
 chairman volcker.
 
 there's cost push high interest
 
 rate?

 mr. stockton. there's small cost push higher interest
 that's true gener outlook.
 
 chairman volcker. sai cost capit, mean
 term cost term affect amount invest?
 mr. stockton. mean term cost rather affect
 amount invest.
 ms. teeter. level interest rate chang, then,
 requir get particular path real gnp?
 mr. stockton. feder fund rate 10-3/4 percent
 path 1984 drift 9 percent 1988.
 
 11/14-15/83
 
 ms. teeter. implic rise interest rate
 short term order produc decreas rate real growth

 mr. stockton.
 
 that's correct.
 
 chairman volcker. still 9 percent interest rate

 mr. stockton.
 
 that's correct.
 
 chairman volcker.
 
 governor wallich.
 
 mr. wallich. cost capit 30 percent:

 mr. stockton.

 mr. wallich. tell littl period

 mr. stockton. well, would certainli chang. hope
 made clear altern assumpt [of "credibl"

 understand correctli: someon expect inflat, it's

 chairman volcker. well, let's examin proposit.
 i'll let mr. gramlei answer that.

 11/14-15/83
 
 mr. gramlei. would like ask staff question.
 chanc turn exercis head sai: suppos
 walk unemploy rate gradual natur
 rate 1988? result get then? don't think
 go bad, realli.
 mr. stockton. fact, done exercis,
 end inflat rate littl 4 percent 1988
 unemploy rate would gotten 7 percent
 time.
 mr. gramlei. accept definit price
 stabil presid feder reserv bank minneapoli,
 we're almost there.
 chairman volcker. surpris littl get
 answer base upon number. get unemploy rate
 where? natur rate 6-1/2 percent?
 mr. stockton.
 
 seven.
 
 mr. gramlei. take straight phillip curv
 approach make rough ballpark calcul, leav
 happen exchang valu dollar, look
 ought abl get [unemploy] even lower that.
 suppos differ effect dollar.
 chairman volcker. you? unemploy rate
 went steadili, would bound higher inflat rate
 1985, right?
 mr. stockton. that's correct. inflat rate goe
 4-1/2 5 percent '85, back 4-1/2 percent '86,
 4-1/4 percent '87, littl 4 percent '88.
 mr. gramlei. you're alwai natur rate

 get improv, speed limit effect.
 speed limit effect case on much
 disput; everybodi believ speed limit hypothesi.
 threw out, would get even better perform.
 mr. parte. mai tack toni's question?
 bother too. threw number interest rate
 1988 i'm sure heard correctli. thought said 9
 percent fund rate. $120 billion
 improv budget situat?
 mr. stockton. that's right. actual budget deficit,
 cours, still remain fairli high, get much weaker-mr. parte. ye, it's $120 billion better budget deficit
 otherwis--that is, without chang polici occur.
 there's still 9 percent fund rate 1 percent rate
 inflat? sound extraordinarili tough.
