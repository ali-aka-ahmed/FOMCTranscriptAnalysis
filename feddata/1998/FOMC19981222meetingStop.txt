 Committee two productive discussions year disclosure issues

 Committee's views seem evolved mainly two disparate positions,
 presented cogent arguments favor. One group, small majority 18
 governors presidents, supports: (1) releasing operating paragraph directive,
 includes tilt, immediately every FOMC meeting; (2) releasing brief announcement
 immediately meetings either policy stance tilt changed; (3)
 releasing minutes meeting soon feasible every FOMC meeting, presumably
 couple weeks earlier now.
 Another group, sizable minority, advocates keeping status quo
 respects. is, operating paragraph would continue released along minutes
 next meeting, immediate announcements would routinely made policy
 changes.

 Finally, two presidents would drop tilt entirely operating paragraph.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Wow!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Instead, would propose compromise solution,
