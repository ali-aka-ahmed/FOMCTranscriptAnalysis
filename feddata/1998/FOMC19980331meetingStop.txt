 preamble, let engage little mind-reading

 First, isn't upward-revised GDP growth rate 3.1 percent

 That's certainly reasonable question. Judging growth

 But, might ask, doesn't imply implausible drop labor

 First, crises Asia: Asia effect, although

 Second, Japan: Recent data--including fourth-quarter GDP

 Third, oil: decline oil prices mid-March surprise.

 might note price oil forecast also $4.50 per barrel

 Fourth, dollar: small decline dollar's value built

 Putting four elements together, see balance risks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Larry, noticed last couple days

 MR. PARRY. Mike, two questions somewhat related. Greenbook

 guess Bob McTeer's comments exception today--our District economy seems
 accounts remained strong. indications manufacturing sector
 shipments may softening bit, orders remain quite strong. Like Jack Guynn
 others, gotten occasional comments folks indicating Asian situation
 negative impact particular industries, especially paperboard industry.
 manufacturer told us paperboard orders Korea Indonesia recently fallen
 sharply, stories exception rather rule. Manufacturing important
 region manufacturers quite optimistic longer term. general,
 expecting total shipments, domestic plus exports, higher perhaps significantly
 higher six months now.
 Elsewhere, words one retail contacts, consumer spending "going
 great guns." Auto sales may little spotty, higher dealers expected
 long ago. housing sector remains strong, hear
 tales speculative building. lot anecdotal reports tight labor
 markets I, too, hesitate add more, contacts want talk
 about. small business council meeting couple weeks ago, member runs
 employment agency Washington reported firm longer counsels prospective
 employees attract prospective employers. Rather, counsels "candidate" employers

 national economy, least hard evidence opposed
 pure predictions Asian problem negative impact U.S. net exports.
 Obviously, need watch situation give weight deliberations. But, Jack
 Guynn Cathy Minehan mentioned, Asian situation another side it. also
 effects helping strengthen already robust U.S. domestic demand, helping keep
 inflation rate down, helping therefore keep real wages up, also helping keep U.S.
 interest rates down.
 balance, think it's reasonably clear least period since last
 meeting, strengthening domestic demand outstripped whatever negative impact
 fact coming Asia. Greenbook obviously recognized
 experience fairly striking upward revision one meeting next projected
 growth real GDP coming year. still think, Mike Prell said staff view
 well, risk upside projection. felt along feel even
 strongly now, especially respect inflation.
 regard, interesting note almost Greenbook's projected
 decline real GDP accounted drop productivity growth, several people
 noted already. means labor markets expected remain tight forecast
 horizon. little surprising despite extraordinary job market tightness
 widespread expectations health care costs going move up, Greenbook

 project increase growth rate ECI compensation 1998 1997. Unit labor
 costs projection rise result weak productivity growth. So, get
 projected .3 percentage point increase, consistently measured basis, core CPI
 core PCE measures inflation. Obviously, compensation moves strongly
 staff expecting, would compound upward push prices emanating labor
 markets.
 Approaching inflation risk different direction, know M2 growth
 accelerated sharply late. well aware tax refund effects may explain
 part strength, know M2 velocity still subject lot uncertainty. Even so,
 think would mistake overlook might straightforward explanation
 strong M2 growth, namely domestic demand very, strong currently. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start commenting three
 four characteristics District economy, familiar
 perhaps less so. talk little national economy.
 regard District, nearly sectors regional economy remain
 strong. example, District employment 3-1/2 percent early 1997 early 1998.
 Minnesota 4 percent. really remarkable, startling,
 numbers new workers coming from. exactly get Sunbelt immigration
 rates District! [Laughter] impressive performance.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. going answer question?
 MR. STERN. think part explanation people taking second even
 third jobs. wasn't going get anecdotal competition this. [Laughter] hear

 hand, seeing something observed since probably
 mid-1980s. don't want exaggerate this, see indications two-tier
 economy developing urban areas better rural areas. principal
 problem rural areas agriculture. partially question commodity prices-and Asia may effect--and partially question growing conditions, right
 terribly favorable. said that, always problem every
 generalization, energy sector, course rural, iron ore industry,
 also rural, well moment.
 third final regional characteristic want comment relates shortages.
 comment labor situation, related shortage housing,
 particularly rural areas employment gone up. metropolitan areas,
 think housing construction sufficiently strong less keep housing

 far national economy concerned, overall must say conditions look

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want focus three aspects
 continuity developments since last meeting. First, continued
 exceptional momentum private domestic demand payroll employment, partially
 offset decline net exports. Second, strength domestic demand continued
 supported favorable financial conditions, including soaring equity prices. Third,
 favorable supply shocks, reinforced case sharper-than-expected decline oil prices,
 continued restrain inflation.

 favorable supply shocks restraining inflation dissipate. result economy

 forecast horizon. remarkably favorable outcome, especially since occurs

 risks, however, seem weighted perspective stronger growth hence

 takes hold. also potential crosscurrents clearly identified
 Greenbook may work little less favorably price inflation, exert somewhat pressure

 developments, interacting slowdown productivity growth, suggest potential
 less benign projected path labor costs coming quarters. Looking 1999, also

 Financial conditions general monetary policy particular played
 important roles supporting recent economic performance. Favorable financial conditions
 supporting aggregate demand, notwithstanding sharp rise real federal funds rate
 stemming decline inflation. Real long-term rates steady declining, equity
 prices soaring, credit availability ample, underwriting standards may eased
 somewhat, loan pricing aggressive, money growth rapid. True, good reason

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. fourth meeting.
 previous three, felt rather confident advice, I'm afraid joining cold feet
 crowd. Let first make comments Greenbook forecast policy
 strategy.
 Greenbook, big change forecast last time many
 noted. second comment least one projected sources slowdown
 questionable me. think us really knew talking
 
 3/31/98
 
 regard stock market values, would here. would something
 else. always troubled forecast stock market decline sense
 stock market traders know everything know. presumably know earnings
 forecasts. So, troubled assumption effect see something
 cannot see. Mike Prell conveniently done alternative forecast assume
 stock market decline. forecast, growth real GDP moderate pace
 trend rate long-run economic growth. gets trend maybe even bit
 it, part slowdown staff's baseline forecast based assumption stock
 market decline. another way look stock market. compare price/earnings
 ratios interest rates, ratios necessarily look line. So, market decline
 source slowdown seems little shaky me.
 third point would make forecast, lot brought
 questions, even core inflation really "core." already lot positive
 supply shocks measure. Inflation could heating little even speak, though
 apparent look CPI excluding food energy.
 also want make comments policy strategy. Actually, Larry Meyer
 made first talked reaction good news. point great
 low unemployment, cannot overemphasize relation inflation.
 careful know doing. that, Larry said well
 repeat comments.
 second point policy strategy among think
 operate basis federal funds rate target. point target
 tried work out, others tried work out, way federal funds rate replicates
 
 3/31/98
 
 would respond economic events following money standard.
 following money growth standard, somehow putting aside supply shocks
 velocity shocks give us much trouble interpreting monetary aggregates. think
 perfectly possible operate modified money growth standard,
 remember so, federal funds rate bounce around. risk following
 funds rate target get target rigid, ought keep mind
 well.
 third policy strategy comment lags. Economic conditions great now.
 Alice Rivlin says, may seeing best performance economy ever.
 enough historian know that, certainly good remember.
 look around world, see uniquely blessed, look ahead.
 known lags monetary policy conducting policy
 basis see side door drive basis see ahead.
 look ahead, must say inflation risks beginning get little threatening
 aggregate demand risks Asia beginning get little less threatening.
 last point would like make relates something surprise nobody
 mentioned meetings attended. get periodical desk called Fed
 Watch. Probably get it. Every time new statistics come out, Fed Watch says
 Fed going heart palpitations new set numbers, anything
 meeting May meeting. reluctant predictable. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. coffee break, President
 Boehne suggested relatively little say time around short
 
 3/31/98
 
 distance travel. office nearest room, short Chairman's,
 even less say time.
 Let observe, others have, first quarter spillover
 Asian crisis indeed overshadowed strength domestic demand. Labor markets
 remained tight, many indicated. One thing would add
 discussed much short-term interest rates risen relatively high levels
 historical standards, de facto policy tightening associated similar tightness
 longer end yield spectrum. Risk spreads private debt instruments quite narrow,
 extension credit private nonfinancial borrowers numerous sources--commercial
 paper, bank lending, on--is running well pace last couple years. So,
 think stimulative environment monetary financial standpoint.
 second thing would add relates Asia. already talked little
 impact seen developments Asia. returned trip Japan
 met central bankers finance ministers affected countries. Two things
 emerged meetings would like bring attention. One
 Koreans Thais certainly feel economies road recovery,
 describe recoveries "U" shaped, expect economies bounce along
 bottom extended period finally see uptick. Secondly, major
 economy region, Japan, still facing significant challenges. visit, found
 universal agreement economy least stagnant probably recession.
 fiscal stimulus packages introduced date, latest one totaling 16 trillion yen, thought
 far less stimulative might appear. one newspaper indicated, recent
 
 3/31/98
 
 package "big, vague, unconvincing." Therefore, think United States still likely
 importer last resort impact yet felt Asia.
 summarize brief comments, risks see? believe, number
 others, increasing inflation risk emanating labor market tightness,
 potential ending special factors restrained inflation recently,
 stimulus emerging financial markets. still see possibility greaterthan-desired drag Asia, think risk less time last
 meeting. Overall, believe vigilant posture, recognizing risks
 seem tilted toward upside. see dangers premature change policy
 stance might great would take markets surprise. Unlike colleague
 right, think predictability sometimes bad thing.

 Asian crisis could turn negative. Indeed, although conditions seem

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Don? not, let get started.

 question, however, far rise stock market prices go. know
 history markets perceived overvalued exceptionally long period

 evident last time met, namely, operating earnings beginning

 Therefore, sense responding Cathy Minehan's question start

 believe would create large shock system, would able absorb

 alert expansion slow down, start move. think
 clock starting tick, guess unless evidence Asian slowdown fairly
 pronounced and/or stock market goes direction, singing different
 tune next time meet.
 So, would recommend put "B" asymmetric table consideration. feel
 uncomfortable switching back asymmetry moved symmetry recently,
 think real world changed. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, support proposal.
 think would unwise change policy today, said general
 tenor comments around table convince hesitate move
 evidence somewhat clear appropriate thing do. now, believe
 "B" asymmetric toward tightening right policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, certainly support recommendation change
 present time enthusiastically support move asymmetry. seems
 discussion strongly supports move.
 
 3131/98
 
 question. relates recollection talked
 going handle public announcement no-change decision, discussed
 possibility making statement accompany announcement. one thinks
 economic developments moving direction likely change policy would
 occur--say, next meeting--and given stressed importance laying
 foundation policy change, adoption asymmetry clearly could lay foundation.
 current procedures asymmetry announced two days next meeting,
 public put notice timely basis. wonder virtue making
 statement announcement strength economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. interesting question. would appreciate
 hearing comments that. Vice Chair, comment?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. economy continues move
 direction next meeting, think would begin preparing
 way. object Bob Parry suggesting. Marginally, would prefer
 policy speech.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would inclination. reason would feel
 uncomfortable short press statement could leave that. question
 would remain it. appears economic developments beginning
 move us toward policy change, think lot explain. might add,
 incidentally, cannot perceived moving thwart stock market. may
 implicit analysis economy doing, move curb buildup stock
 market wealth difficult issue put table. careful that.
 
 3/31/98
 
 argument wealth effect driving domestic demand, turn driving
 product markets, cannot that, may put way.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, appreciate viewpoint Bill McDonough
 expressed, understand may opportunities lay foundation.
 obvious change current procedure, going asymmetry
 accomplish want. Asymmetry would serve alert public decision
 change policy delayed beyond next meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. think unsustainable situation. Unless quite
 fortunate get offset inflationary demand pressures policy action,
 indeed face making policy adjustment probably once.
 issue preparing market, think policy speech appropriate
 time far superior two three sentence press release. couple reasons: One,
 think need make policy statement, prepared follow fairly
 quickly policy action. don't want get "cry wolf" situation
 talk act. So, would prefer wait looks though policy action needs
 take place. speech would prepare markets time, policy action would
 follow. Ultimately, actions, words, count, words matter
 followed action. Second, would suggest addition usual macroeconomic
 rationale action, policy speech stress like good times, like
 people jobs, acting sustain good times. point made earlier
 lower echelons labor force beginning participate prosperity,
 would first unemployed things went awry. think important also
 
 3/31/98
 
 make point like helps give balanced view policy. indicates
 growth lower echelon workers making progress and, indeed,
 moving sustain progress. would urge add usual macro analysis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, expected general tone meeting
 bullish February meeting, bullish comments today exceeded
 expectations! So, surprise anyone else would still prefer take
 action today. Governor Gramlich's comments operating funds rate target resonated
 me. certainly true movement real federal funds rate,
 pegged nominal funds rate almost two years. Obviously, move
 rate meeting, would certainly support very, strongly recommendation
 asymmetry.
 lot sympathy point Bob Parry made, fact going
 raise issue. think move asymmetric directive, would desirable
 announce decision rather waiting six seven weeks. believe
 important, use Bill McDonough's metaphor, us let people know guardian
 guardian awake. know problems suggestion, one
 could make good case routinely announcing directive language tilt concurrently rather
 shortly following meeting. tilt language routine part
 directive; questions practice, fact follow it. don't see
 compelling reason release concurrently.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Wouldn't better start
 matter?
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. BROADDUS. would convenient, doubt it. Maybe best
 way-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. establish precedent, seems best
 create problems.
 MR. BROADDUS. That's good point. may best way go
 preparing markets currently make speech sort bring
 matter up. think might want consider later alternative announcing
 something immediately meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Referring back something said earlier
 opening sentence general paragraphs directive, think need make change
 there.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think already done.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. listened earlier comment, think
 wise heads around made change.
 MR. JORDAN. agree Ed Boehne include public comments
 concerning reasons policy actions. still think actions early 1994, properly
 viewed, prevented recession 1996. faced today prevent
 next credit crunch recession year 2000. enough problems
 year 2000 without deal recession real estate debacle. thought
 remarks, Mr. Chairman, developed persuasive case acting now. particularly
 concerned stock market. agree reason something, view
 
 3/31/98
 
 also reason something. believe reasons taking action would
 excessive growth whole constellation money credit aggregates, upward revision
 expectations growth economic activity, going banking
 industry especially real estate markets. 1/4 percentage point increase federal
 funds rate would deliver important message. going get first-quarter
 numbers make obvious everybody acted. concerned basis
 published information, case surface move may compelling
 middle May today, would strongly prefer taking action today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, accept recommendation presented it.
 information suggests wait: relatively high real federal funds rate, fairly
 low trendless inflation right now, bond markets signaling benign inflation
 expectations. also issue timing. believe move fairly soon,
 meeting, information economy: labor markets obviously tight,
 aggregate demand growth remains quite robust, monetary growth accelerating even though
 uncertainty velocity, finally, increasingly frequent reports large
 amounts global liquidity seeking investment outlets accelerating inflation assets.
 developments give pause concern. So, yes, wait,
 sense pressure act relatively prompt basis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation change
 federal funds rate asymmetric posture.
 
 3/31/98
 
 considerable sympathy notion that, rather expanding
 policy announcement, immediate release directive would indicate-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. mean whole directive?
 MR. MEYER. whole directive. hand, think proposal deserves
 full discussion pros cons move forward. decide go
 direction, might want time directive would create surprise
 released. relevant issues. change symmetry asymmetry sends
 indication partial tightening easing market, willingness move
 symmetry asymmetry may affected whether going announce move,
 depending impact going market. Another consideration, Mr.
 Chairman, would signaling markets speech would allow provide
 explanation, think would desirable point also.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, could comment whether make
 announcement? earlier discussions, expressed sympathy President
 Parry talking regarding announcements believe information
 value. However, like others, think release statement occasion,
 set precedent continue making statements going forward. think
 requires fair amount discussion impact want manage that.
 reason, would also encourage prepare markets sense
 carefully drawn speech outlines issues face gives market
 information would short statement meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. POOLE. surprised recent months markets responded
 little stronger anticipated economic data. markets absolutely solid
 expectations move. think unfortunate situation faces us
 sit today. outsider, also puzzled asymmetric directive
 appears six weeks time adopted. may turn
 message want time actually appears. think know kind
 message would like give today would expect remarks Chairman
 intends give appropriate time--namely, markets need prepared
 tightening future. asymmetric directive, released quickly, could mechanism
 providing message. hope deal issue promptly. agree
 need discuss it, hope agenda quite soon perhaps make
 decision next meeting. view, disclosing symmetry asymmetry
 promptly might benefits. find puzzling adopt asymmetric
 directive today, prepared support, released next
 meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think ought put agenda next
 meeting. issue come form recently, think worthwhile
 discussing it.
 MR. POOLE. I, like everyone else around table, well aware inflation
 numbers look good. concerned vulnerable stage. could
 bad news rise inflation gets going, particularly policy gotten
 behind, going hard catch up. So, think want move see
 worsening inflation numbers. going keep control.
 
 3/31/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. 1, too, support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, share Bill
 Poole's concern timing release asymmetry. release point
 us good, think implication Ed Boehne
 talking about. give policy speech elaborates current attitudes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation. lot
 said already, don't want repeat it. view, one thing may well undo
 expansion benefits society inflation start accelerate require us take
 severe action. So, think absolutely essential look ahead
 policy preemptive. last thing want caught situation behind
 curve. think important lay foundation policy action, think
 suggestion policy speech Bill McDonough made excellent one. also
 want associate Ed Boehne's comments nature speech. thought
 good suggestions explain objectives terms
 broad-based benefits sustainable economic growth want see continued
 benefit segments society.
 think review use asymmetric symmetric directives. believe
 policy that. use symmetry systematic way, would
 prepare markets changes may make disclosure aspect
 policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation "B"
 asymmetric. think important signal vigilant want maintain
 gains already made.
 removed asymmetry directive December, asked one
 Board members announce change then. told
 would announcing two different policies time. wasn't sure understood
 explanation then, I'm sure understand now, think that-MS. RIVLIN. sounded okay!
 MR. FERGUSON. one many explanations! believe, however,
 issue deserves consideration. So, would rush announcing now, think
 discuss issue next meeting. recognize explanations
 make move tighten policy because, inflation pressures building, also
 low inflation numbers low inflation expectations. view, considerations
 point direction policy speech opposed simply quick announcement
 meeting. would associate President Boehne say respect
 making sure people recognize context policy action undertaken
 remind people economic benefits achieved date come low
 inflation. believe important keep two things mind.
 guess concern would relates trying think
 policy strategy going forward. might appropriate meeting, perhaps next
 looks though new policy trend, quite clear exactly
 strategy is. think Governor Gramlich referring earlier.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support recommendation
 pleased return asymmetry. take heart, guess everyone else does,
 resolve wait long.
 finish thought, guess obvious said Bill Poole,
 Gary Stern, others way signal move asymmetry
 today, minutes come couple days show us symmetrical
 stance February meeting. development seems cry kind mechanism
 correct think misimpression would prefer give next
 couple days.
 SPEAKER(?). That's right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, strongly support recommendation.
 Relative discussion possible announcement, would strong
 preference making one today. preference based longer-term reason
 immediate reason. longer-term reason would one expressed around
 table, namely, would precedential impact one consider
 carefully, rush into. say parenthetically--we going debate issue
 today--that great reservations whole idea.
 immediately, believe make new type announcement
 today market seen expect, would come quite shock
 confusing. this? make announcement
 change policy? see potential reaction fairly major proportions would
 setting do. So, would hesitant that.
 
 3/31/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation, think
 remind that, exception Bill Poole, before.
 situation changed new view outlook. inconceivable
 back six weeks something, presumably developments Asia, weakened
 
 expansion may quite sure seem today everything moving
 direction overly strong economy. certainly agree looks today.
 also lot sympathy suggestion announce asymmetry decision
 immediately. think wish already adopted policy could say
 something asymmetry announcement today. change announcement
 policy midstream without prior discussion, probably would better raise fed
 funds rate today peculiar unexpected thing.
 also would like stress importance making policy speech,
 series policy speeches us weaving remarks
 feel. would suggest emphasis worries speculation, loose
 credit, concerns people relate rather saying think economy
 ought restrained worried tight labor markets poor people
 earning money. sounds silly say way, sometimes come across
 though real worries tight labor markets rather objective, Bill McDonough
 said earlier, keeping labor markets tight retaining benefits full employment
 future.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. think hold now. see
 immediate pressure act. unless economy cools off, believe tighten.
 respect symmetry asymmetry, think act
 intermeeting period, would telephone conference anyway, I'm sure type
 symmetry adopt means much. vein, would vote asymmetry.
 think policy speech probably better now, agree President Boehne
 prepared act shortly speech. also agree sustainability
 economic growth issue, emphasized speeches.
 believe probably would useful discussion consider possible release
 directive meeting. point thought pros cons,
 discussion might clear question whether symmetry asymmetry means
 anything. So, look forward discussion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, came meeting prepared vote
 increase 25 basis points federal funds rate, also came prepared dissent
 least move asymmetry. glad recommendation move asymmetry.
 support it, concerned continue face difficulty explaining tightening
 move context declining price trends. course, expectations price
 trends turn around course period current monetary policy

 vulnerability financial markets President Poole described lack
 
 3/31/98
 
 uncertainty markets. think face real risk feeding speculative excess
 ultimately come haunt us move soon. may still mean moving
 broad price trends suggest major inflation upticks. frankly believe, along
 think least one member Committee, moving might easier
 moving later, given transitory effects Asia. But, again, willing go along
 proposal.
 felt time announcement change much policy move
 announcement change. So, change policy, think would
 helpful go beyond saying 2:15: "the meeting ended time."
 figure way say one two sentences made policy change, could figure
 way say one two sentences make policy change
 general policy attitude is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. could part discussion
 next meeting part issue.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right, takes policy speech proposal. know
 commenting issues policy speeches, agree Alice Rivlin, Ed
 Boehne, others talked context describe policy actions.
 lot comfortable policy speeches move move. worry
 latter. going telegraph
 fact rather explaining fact? think better avoid
 stance us trying telegraph actually it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support no-move, asymmetric directive.
 see mastered Fedspeak, somebody proposed raise fed funds rate
 25 basis points, would supported that, too! worried, said, could get
 position rigid funds rate. see 25 basis points
 big deal. going fundamental effect boom put lot workers
 street. So, think 25 basis point increase could justified, support
 no-move, asymmetric directive.
 think ought discuss releasing directive earliest opportunity.
 agree change procedures now, would cause lot uncertainty
 turbulence, reason that. ought discuss issue soon
 possible. would little better shape, Governor Rivlin suggested,
 precedent announcing asymmetric directive today. So, think prepare
 future.
 Let say one thing issue. believe, Mr. Chairman,
 give policy speeches--and read lot became member Board--there
 feeling, least it, speaking yourself. Maybe naive
 part. think one advantage getting word sooner way take heat
 indicating us stand behind policy least FOMC stands behind
 policy. view, would advantage getting word sooner. So, would
 like discuss proposal early date. wish could today. accept
 cannot, would like see change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. think broad consensus around "B"
 asymmetric, would read directive.
 
 3/31/98
 
 MR. KOHN. Excuse me, Norm. first sentence directive, Mr.
 Chairman, one possibility would keep essentially words used last
 directive. would say, changing words sentence: "The information reviewed
