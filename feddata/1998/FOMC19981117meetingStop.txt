 recent meetings, contemplating ways improve number procedures

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, beginning page 15 Bluebook today's
 meeting, list three options Committee consideration. Option 1 traditional language.
 Option 2, included memorandum wrote Committee early
 November, reflects revisions President Hoenig suggested September meeting.
 optional inclusions "furthers" options 2 3 Committee may

 explicit reference Committee's perception risks balanced least
 intermeeting period related belief change slight upward downward move
 might equally likely. "tilt" language, perceived balance risks explicitly
 mentioned implicit Committee's adoption upside downside tilt. Also,
 would agree Presidents Boehne Parry Governor Kelley regard
 desirability dropping next last sentence Option 2 starts "Any potential
 changes...." don't think needed. don't pride authorship,
 warm fuzzy feeling idea mentioning balance risks directive.
 
 11/17/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. never heard anybody talk risks "warm
 fuzzy." [Laughter] President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Cathy, alternative wording tilt directive refers
 economic, financial, monetary developments; fine. Option 2 talks prospective
 developments, tilt tilt; fine well. agreeable talking risks,
 "no tilt" sentence refers "risks economic outlook." stopped could
 interpreted mean real growth rather "economic, financial, monetary developments."
 saw recently, variety near-term risks may cause Committee something

 MS. MINEHAN. intention reference economic outlook would

 conditions" two expressions would considered equivalent context

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, understand logic Option

 Jordan picked concern would mentioning risks context, namely

 Hoenig earlier version, option captures found reasonable last meeting.
 believe even tilt, need disputed sentence, "any potential changes

 question view--and good colleagues Committee
 circumstances intermeeting period indicate desirability change policy,
 implement change. courtesy shown us, Mr. Chairman, least
 5-1/2
 years I've sitting here, don't think there's slightest worry
 power would used wisely well. So, think it's important
 sentence question retained.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, think either Option 2 Option 3 would
 significant improvement now. reasons Jerry Jordan mentioned,
 would preference Option 2. view, little compact little clearer.
 would agree feel remove third sentence. so,
 would suggest change end preceding sentence. reference "the
 federal funds rate coming months," would prefer see words "in coming months"
 changed "in intermeeting period." would make period talking
 little explicit definite. Finally, get language changed, hope
 move next think equally critical question whether release
 information public shortly meeting directive set.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. prefer Option 2. view, captures talking
 around table. would drop sentence beginning "Any potential changes."
 reason suggesting deletion think basically redundant, though
 substantively harmless. need Chairman fully effective. fully effective
 
 11/17/98
 
 Chairman needs able change federal funds rate meetings. dropping
 adding sentence way affects that, whichever strengthens Chairman's hand
 fully effective.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, prefer Option 2, would like remove third
 sentence I, too, believe redundant. seems me, though, Options 2
 3 tremendous improvement wording using recent years.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. think Option 2 would distinct improvement favor that.
 think dropping sentence "any potential changes" probably good idea
 seems redundant me, don't feel strongly it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. want join seems emerging consensus. I, too, prefer
 Option 2, would eliminate sentence question. don't think adds anything,
 whatever briefer point better. also would echo view would
 desirable us move point immediate release language
 meetings. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. I, too, thinking Cathy Minehan right track, back
 Option 2 simpler. subtleties sentence consideration
 removal escaped me, favor taking out. still favor dropping unless
 subtlety conveyed. subtle, 2-1/2
 years, maybe really unnecessary.
 
 11/17/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, think either option would improvement
 currently have, I, too, slight preference Option 2 mainly
 think discussion risks internally focused. hand, hope
 decide release directive and, therefore, would like something written relatively
 plain English. view, Option 2 quite nicely. respect added sentence,
 follow think emerging consensus dropped, though don't feel strongly
 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. favor Option 2, agree sentence "any potential
 changes" add clarity directive. new issue would like raise
 relates last sentence directive concerning M2 M3. would hope would

 expectation. think, example, slower growth probably expectation
 recent past. So, would hope going sentence directive,
 actually reflect judgment Committee ritually inserted.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. mean would refer staff
 forecast distinct Committee statement?
 MR. POOLE. Perhaps, yes.
 MR. LINDSEY. actually using monetary growth numbers sentence
 earlier. Committee downgraded monetary aggregates 1993, changed
 wording sentence eliminate numbers include qualitative description.
 intent always provide qualitative description exactly describes staff forecast
 
 11/17/98
 coming months--not always next month two but, example, 6-month
 horizon currently Bluebook. Unfortunately, 1998 progressed
 hit continuing upside surprises relation forecast. So, somewhat
 embarrassed slowdown predicted.
 MR. POOLE. potential problem here. agree Al Broaddus
 federal funds language refer intermeeting period, think it's clear
 reference growth monetary aggregates covers intermeeting period. So,
 put language longer horizon aggregates.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, could explain why, unlike
 others, feel Option 2 sentence question?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's first finish discussion money supply
 issue. anybody else views handle question?
 MR. MEYER. think President Poole bringing extraordinarily good
 point. almost embarrassment use standard sentence incorporates
 expectation sometimes right. want include reference
 directive, adjust reflect changes money growth forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. anyone insights? think
 raises quite unanswerable question, resolve one way another.
 problem sense contemplated reserve conditions constantly changing

 MR. LINDSEY. recent memory, includes last couple years,
 altered wording sentence say "consistent moderate growth M2 M3

 monetary growth strong year, persistent staff forecast moderation
 future. So, wording sentence year continuously reflected staff
 forecast moderating growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. turned sentence wrong,

 MR. LINDSEY. Exactly. locked in. happens describe staff

 MS. MINEHAN. choice "moderate" "some moderation."
 MR. LINDSEY. appropriate terms forecast, said
 "moderate."
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think President Minehan right answer.
 MR. LINDSEY. That's good point. meetings future, Committee could
 choose exact wording be. Committee may want henceforth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. everyone agreement advisable?
 SEVERAL. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair, floor sentence.

 might put statement notify public future use different
 language would say rewording reflect change Federal
 Reserve policies. effort clarify meaning directives. fact
 exactly trying do.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think clarifications tend get lost,
 problem would perpetuated meeting meeting. effort eliminate redundancy,
 really would inviting problem don't need have.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would President Broaddus's recommendation resolve
 this? One possibility combine sentences read part "more likely warrant [a
 further] increase/decrease [a further] decrease/increase federal funds rate
 
 11/17/98
 
 intermeeting period" instead "in coming months." might interesting way
 combining sentences.
 MR. FERGUSON. May speak point, Mr. Chairman? may minority
 one thinking suggested revision doesn't need do. Okay, may
 speaking others! read use tilt, covers longer period specific
 intermeeting period. collapse two, leave false impression
 focusing intermeeting period opposed indicating may end adjusting
 policy given direction longer period time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't say "in intermeeting period
 coming months?" Would it?
 MR. FERGUSON. answers particular problem.
 MR. KELLEY. problem longer time frame review
 tilt sentence routinely every meeting. may come conclusion
 meeting meeting, though tend often not. event, tilt adopted
 given meeting operative intermeeting period always review
 next meeting.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That, think, magic original
 drafting. picked "in coming months," longer intermeeting period,
 gave Chairman power adjust policy intermeeting period. explained
 greatest clarity we, fact, behave.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. power; authority. Power irrelevant.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Agreed. Correctly stated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 
 11/17/98
 
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, found working issue much like eating
 first raw oyster ever ate. chewed it, bigger got harder got
 swallow. [Laughter] discussion morning made issue easier
 swallow. certainly agree others say Option 2 improvement
 language today. came meeting preference, think still it,
 language Cathy Minehan's option. say think adding reference
 risks outlook, although creates ambiguity, avoids Option 2 seems
 imply, namely minds least people forecast next policy move. may
 providing information really intend. So, would comfortable
 Option 3, Option 2 would improvement today. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, record favor taking sentence
 discussion, still preference. agree sentence
 redundant, also think would confusing public. subtleties rather deep.
 problem sense sentence attempting convey. certainly agree
 Vice Chairman Committee, leadership, problem
 area all. find sentence confusing, reason don't think serves us
 well. also would like repeat support notion changing timing reference
 previous sentence "in coming months" "in intermeeting period" suggested
 President Broaddus.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, listening discussion, would mention first
 think solution Al Broaddus proposed placing "intermeeting period"
 
 11/17/98
 
 end sentence strikes good suggestion. would take sentence
 talking about. agree Governor Kelley confusing. confused
 think confuse others. authority clear previous statement without
 additional sentence, especially put reference "intermeeting period."
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. becomes clear put
 "intermeeting period."
 MR. HOENIG. agree that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. becomes language question. concur,
 however, point Governor Kelley made previous positions taken
 Committee void next meeting. sense, may continue given tilt
 indefinitely, require renewal every time meet. give Desk authority
 move intermeeting period without presumption moves
 thereafter authority anyone thereafter. don't know whether sentence solves
 problem, Governor Gramlich going tell us whether does.
 MR. GRAMLICH. going do! [Laughter] First,
 Option 2. set support Bill McDonough keeping sentence question
 point world could changes funds rate intermeeting period.
 think proposed insertion "in intermeeting period coming months"
 previous sentence that. makes clear, Roger Ferguson's sense, talking
 symmetry asymmetry future, also calls attention fact
 could changes intermeeting period. modifier tilt sentence,
 view take sentence, Mike Kelley Ed Boehne suggested. So,
 Option 2, adding "in intermeeting period" sentence tilt deleting next
 
 11/17/98
 
 sentence. also hope get chance discuss issue immediate release
 would favor immediate release paragraph.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, wanted weigh time period
 question. fully agreement Governor Kelley confine tilt
 sentence intermeeting period. changed language alternative explicit
 that. So, think change President Broaddus suggested--to insert
 reference intermeeting period tilt tilt sentence--is right way go. also
 favor taking next sentence qualifying reference aggregates last
 sentence providing alternatives "moderate/some moderation" get potential
 range growth discussion M2 M3. So, could go Option 2 way
 revised today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. sentence relating tilt, would like substitute "the
 intermeeting period" "in coming months" delete "in coming months." do, though,
 want ask staff think last sentence money aggregates.
 thing like sentence constant repetition expected moderation
 subtle acknowledgement growth immoderate, [laughter] embarrassed,
 would like something that. However, never look M3. look
 monetary base extent MZM. upon time, used expression
 "monetary aggregates." would like staff think maybe come back
 refers money. money really care about?
 
 11/17/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. problem. feel uncomfortable
 inability understand fully monetary aggregates telling us. fear
 missing something subtle, something yet grasped. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, forgot note eliminate sentence,
 view advantage referring "the federal funds rate operating objective"
 instead "federal funds rate." former really deal with.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mike Kelley given note think
 point, namely made considerable progress today. quite there, think
 Option 2. couple variations tilt sentence.
 options handle M2-M3 sentence. Since five
 weeks away another meeting dithering long, delaying
 decision one meeting going significant. believe stage
 able refine wording. quite close. could, wanted to, spend
 time right now, worth it. Let's get another draft another round
 discussions. may point equivalent notation vote favor change.
 MR. GRAMLICH. happy wait another month, reconsider
 language also agenda issue immediate release operational
 paragraph?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. see separate issue. think
 put agenda, don't decide questions way.
 MR. GRAMLICH. cannot immediately release something agreed on.
 [Laughter]
 
 11/17/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. acknowledge that! Let us put issue table
 again. Hopefully, get wording issue resolved next meeting perhaps make
 considerable progress, even come conclusion, release issue. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. wanted emphasize release issue, too. want miss
 discussion immediate release.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. finally got through! Peter Fisher.

 Third, much ado made political pressure

 Looking panels time focusing
 top panel, two background factors came play think useful
 note. First, rather significant shift volume fed
 funds brokered market late September October. shift reflected
 cutting back credit lines general aversion risk term funding
 markets buyers sellers. lending side,
 aversion lending money longer term year-end,
 created reluctance post offers. buying side,
 aversion seen placing bids high enough attract limited amount
 money side willing sell--a reluctance post bids. So,
 saw literal thinning market, paucity offers bids
 consequent shift demand supply overnight market.
 rush volume overnight market induced kinds
 behavior patterns contributed volatility.
 second consistent background factor period
 major banks normally would willing act two-way traders tended
 hold funds day period.
 willing sell funds late day low rates,
 viewed expected cost minimizing risk might
 come discount window. true banks
 subject rumors. Discount window aversion affected full range
 depository institutions.

 Finally, would like discuss matters relating outright
 operations. reduced size normal purchases Treasury

 relatively illiquid conditions seen, going market
 smaller smaller bites given time means cause less
 less disruption market. quite pleased despite volatile
 conditions experienced, operations become something
 non-event. precisely objective toward
 aspiring.
 second item want mention--and give opportunity
 express opinion, wish--is intention purchase inflationindexed securities outright operations. purchasing
 securities secondary market. acquiring

 Committee expressed degree reluctance, wondering Federal
 Reserve needed inflation protection. [Laughter] would like clear.

 MR. JORDAN. important sense, buy Treasury securities

 also something Sandy Krieger talked several years terms

 MR. POOLE. taking responsibility term structure,

 11/17/98
 
 MR. FISHER. First, think important working repo market,

 that, would like offer comments forces currently

 First, fact GDP growth third quarter apparently
 outstripped expectations invites conclusion we've
 underestimated momentum demand economy. However,
 upside surprise appears pretty much inventory story.

 that, outside auto dealers, stocks little changed September-probably implying marginal downward revision third-quarter

 climbed, quite high industries. minimum,
 believe anticipate businesses, least outside auto sector,
 attempting curb pace accumulation. may well one
 reason tenor news manufacturing sector quite

 past couple years, we've often underestimated desire
 businesses maintain rapid rates inventory accumulation, basically
 underestimated strength final demand. But, recently,
 domestic final demand stronger anticipated;
 wasn't third quarter, last Friday's figures showing hefty October
 advance retail sales closely line expectations. Moreover,
 greater growth output evidently generated extra jobs
 labor income. Instead, payroll growth slowed expected,
 seems pickup corporate downsizing announcements.
 may one reason early November Michigan SRC survey-while showing considerable bounceback sentiment index--didn't
 show much improvement employment expectations.
 flip side moderate growth labor income may
 shade healthier corporate profit performance anticipated.
 
 11/17/98
 
 trend profits still weak past several quarters and,
 though hope springs eternal stock market, deterioration
 corporate cash flow negative capital spending. anecdotal
 evidence suggests that, whether reason simply don't

 many firms--especially manufacturers--are gearing back investment

 commercial paper market difficulty accommodating

 Nonetheless, still think it's reasonable anticipate take

 However, two different retailers noted construction costs new stores risen

 Turning national economy, although somewhat balanced last
 meeting, still believe risks remain greater downside. Three factors seem

 especially important time. First, although stock market prices rebounded sharply
 recent weeks, market volatility remains high restrain consumption spending
 somewhat months ahead. Second, although credit spreads narrowed since
 intermeeting rate cut, financial markets remain jittery spreads could easily climb again.
 Finally, risks rising inflation appear relatively low. Although labor markets continue
 tight wage growth rising, productivity growth strong enough largely
 offset gains. Moreover, declining profit margins going forward likely stiffen
 resolve many firms hold line wage increases. factors combined
 continued dismal international outlook--we talking Japan Brazil earlier--lead
 view risks remain greater downside.

 grew annual rate 3.3 percent. Household spending still growing 4 percent.
 strong growth fueled jobs--as indicated, labor markets still tight--and wage
 salary growth, credit.
 optimistic scenario, financial markets described fragile recovering.
 stock market continues defy reasonable analysis gives added impetus consumer
 spending, possibly capital spending. importantly optimistic scenario, Asia
 already turned corner Brazil avoids worst outcomes due timely international
 intervention.
 picture very, attractive, I'm afraid reflects limited
 reality. believe growth due labor household consumption, underpins
 positive scenario, limited. Job creation seem slowed considerably late.
 Secondly, note last quarter's GDP growth heavily fueled inventories, seems
 unlikely repeat. Finally, describe pessimistic scenario, great
 focus capital capital investment. Business fixed investment fell last quarter
 1 percent annual rate, think first decline magnitude since 1990
 1991; BFI admittedly retarded nonresidential construction, even investment
 producers' durable equipment barely budged.
 disturbingly, anecdotal survey evidence suggests capital spending plans
 many firms revised downward. slowdown reflects realization profits

 would say financial markets yet returned normal liquidity risk spreads, stock
 market evaluations soon catch much changed profit outlook.
 Finally, pessimistic scenario involves international concerns alluded
 others. Japan, obviously largest economy Asia, continues mired recession.
 Brazil's economic performance likely weak. concerned ability defend
 devaluation, necessary, limited given reserve position. Finally,
 others indicated, China may prove strong current official numbers

 So, two scenarios. question one believe. believe
 optimistic one, obviously monetary policy probably properly positioned now.
 hand, certainty, money pessimistic scenario seem
 possible. domestic international components scenario come pass,
 consequences U.S. economy dire. good news ways
 choose scenarios today. Fortunately, measures, inflation

 limit risk inflation. Therefore, think least one person said, afford

 greatest concerns easing.
 Let first, however, address inflation issue. crucial question ask
 measure inflation. look core CPI, clearly
 accelerated last year moment running area somewhat
 2-1/2 percent annual rate. contrast, core PCE decelerating fairly dramatically
 depending whether using 3-month, 6-month, 12-month rolling averages,
 increase barely 1 percent. half difference measures
 core inflation reflects difference weights housing. know, owners'
 equivalent rent 20 percent CPI total housing close 30 percent, recall.
 PCE, half that. difference occurs substantial extent
 consequence two elements. First, weight CPI based individuals' views
 potential rental value houses live. PCE, derived
 detailed macro data. Second, scope PCE much broader covers much
 wider area consumer expenditures obviously, things equal would lower
 weight housing PCE. even though actual price changes housing owners'
 equivalent rent close PCE CPI, mere difference weights
 fact housing costs rising faster average created dramatic widening
 spread CPI core inflation PCE core inflation, 1-1/2 percentage points.
 
 11/17/98
 
 seriously question whether housing component measure
 underlying inflation. don't want get involved this, think measures
 looking at--the PPI, intermediate prices, commodity prices, data

 put another way, real funds rate rising.
 look unit cost structure nonfinancial corporations,

 sector, measure relevant ECI analysis unit costs,
 accelerated somewhat output per hour nonfinancial corporations.
 consequence unit labor costs rising rate less 1-1/2 percent recent
 quarters total unit costs, include declining unit nonlabor costs, increasing
 shade 1 percent. corporate prices generally stable, implies decline profit
 margins. Indeed, profit margin nonfinancial corporate sector declining
