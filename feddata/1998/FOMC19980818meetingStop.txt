 moving schedule?
 MR. HOENIG. move start meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 MS. MINEHAN. Don't tell Dow Jones!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would like move minutes previous

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval.
 MS. MINEHAN. Second.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Peter Fisher, would start us off?
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. referring package color

 first page usual shows 3-month deposit rates: current, 3-month
 forward, 9-month forward. Since last meeting, small
 noteworthy changes interest rate expectations. United States, top
 panel red, see 9-month forward 3-month rate slipped
 current 3-month rate. Even though negative gap small--a dozen basis
 points so--it widest chart since January period. think
 reflects growing chorus voices market, particularly last 10 days,
 increasingly confident Committee's next move easing
 action.
 middle panel, see, German 9-month forward 3-month
 rate also crept little lower recent weeks. think still reflects
 anticipation increase European rates sometime coming months.
 believe particularly noteworthy 9-month forward 3-month rate
 actually trading around levels 3.8 percent people
 month ago expecting European Central Bank's 1-month policy rate
 set next January. So, reflects quite reduction expectations last
 couple months.

 Turning second page charts, left side three panels showing

 panels depicting market movements since beginning July year.
 Markets gotten little ahead since prepared chart, let focus
 right hand side first make point. think see retrospect

 Chairman would say something rather kind benevolent. Instead, heard
 say exactly said June JEC testimony, namely
 concerned risks inflation deflation, heard
 testify might characterized "make mistake it" delivery.
 respect selection LDP leadership new Japanese

 perhaps Japanese could find FDR. far, appear

 least insofar judged first day so, might feared.
 However, think also great deal anxiety trades settled,

 MR. TRUMAN. don't know either, guess would fixing rate

 would go, words less substance probably Peter Fisher conveyed.

 Looking ahead, forecast altered little, mainly

 Perhaps interesting point appear predicting
 considerably weaker expansion aggregate demand majority
 forecasters. example, latest Blue Chip consensus shows nominal GDP
 growing around 4-1/4percent six quarters projection period--the

 better part percentage point Greenbook prediction--even though
 short-term interest rates are, like ours, flat.
 can't tell sure forecast differs average view
 several dozen Blue Chippers, available detail forecasts
 contains one compelling clue: two members Blue Chip panel

 view trade gap widen around $25 billion next six
 quarters, versus $100 billion forecast. Even allowing
 endogeneities President Poole emphasized prior meeting, feel quite
 comfortable asserting difference key factor subdued

 Let turn, then, inflation side ledger. Given softer real

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District economy expanded strong pace
 first half 1998. Payroll employment grew 2.9 percent annual rate,
 noticeably pace growth rest United States. Among District states,
 growth rapid Arizona, Nevada, Washington recent months. Vigorous
 construction real estate market activity helped maintain District's expansion.
 Construction jobs grown sizzling pace California Nevada year,
 construction activity remains high levels parts District. Although District growth
 outpaced nation's year, slower 1997. Oregon, Utah, Idaho
 cooled most, employment flat slightly second quarter
 states. Employment growth also moderating California year. Among sectors, slower
 growth evident durables manufacturing.
 slowing consistent might expected restraining effects
 East Asian financial economic problems. Data first five months 1998 compared
 period 1997 show growth total District exports fallen essentially
 zero following substantial growth previous years. slowdown appears almost entirely
 attributable East Asia. example, first quarter year, California's exports key
 East Asian countries 13 percent compared year earlier. Exports
 slowed substantially throughout District, Hawaii's struggling economy hit hard
 additional losses Asian tourist business year. Although effects may grow
 year progresses, problems East Asia derailed District's expansion far.
 
 8/18/98
 Turning nation, remains seen whether long awaited slowdown
 sustained second half good deal slowdown due temporary
 factors. Despite doubts, think likely outcome moderate growth around 2
 percent end next year, activity restrained problems East Asian
 economies, high dollar, restrictive fiscal policy, relatively high real short-term interest
 rates. recent drop stock market adds another potentially moderating factor.
 news inflation certainly continues outstanding. GDP price index
 came 1 percent second straight quarter and, know, inflation measured
 index averaged 1 percent past year. Bank forecast,
 unemployment rate quite reach 5 percent end 1999. low rate perpetuates
 acceleration ECI seen past year. However, expect pressure
 price inflation offset diminished inflation expectations, higher value dollar,
 ample industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, somewhat higher trend productivity
 growth. consequence, forecast shows CPI inflation staying 2 2-1/4 percent
 remainder year next. Thank you.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think analysis
 exactly right regard federal funds rate, is, alternative B.
 strongly prefer move symmetric directive reasons stated earlier
 expressed people go-around. Risks increased sides,
 well balanced view. today, see likelihood whatsoever
 would decide move rate next meeting, think next rate move
 equally likely down. Whatever one's theological view Committee
 reaches decisions symmetry asymmetry, one would conclude symmetric directive
 clearly reflects current thinking members.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. agree, Mr. Chairman, symmetric directive makes sense
 moment. directive reflects view unlikely change monetary policy
 anytime soon that, do, may move fed funds rate down. Now,
 wrong before. wrong before. argument see
 changing tilt fact much operational significance moving
 around lot risks looking little silly turn wrong balance risks.
 So, could go along strong argument leaving tilt is, preference
 would adopt symmetric directive.

 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, strongly support

 issue symmetry versus asymmetry. view, tight labor markets impose natural
 asymmetry policy relation growth prospects. Specifically, forecast persistent
 above-trend growth would, believe, justify tighter policy, forecast modestly
 below-trend growth would immediately dictate easier policy. Instead, development
 would help unwind tight labor markets contribute soft landing maximum
 sustainable growth full employment. This, believe, foundation asymmetric
 bias toward tighter policy maintained since March meeting. still believe
 tight labor markets likely growth near trend ultimately dictate next
 move funds rate rather down. balance risks best conveyed
 current tilt policy.
 second asymmetry outlook today. asymmetry relates
 probable outcomes versus central tendency forecasts Japan emerging economies Asia
 elsewhere. Relative baseline forecast, view considerably greater
 risk much worse outcome economies much benign result.
 see downside risk worse case outcome Asia, materialize, likely spread
 emerging market economies constituting serious threat U.S.
 global economies. worse case outcome highest probability,
 worrisome possibility face today. balance, therefore, think symmetric posture
 best choice now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. I, too, agreement recommendation alternative B.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. strong preference symmetry reasons already stated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation alternative B.
 mild preference symmetry. President Minehan, still concern
 risks rising inflation, also agree external sector become uncertain.
 sense symmetry best way communicate concerns taken together.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support alternative B.
 said before, would like see us move regime could move funds rate
 often--not randomly often. [Laughter] don't think would look silly needs

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Except highway?

 MR. GRAMLICH. highway hills. directive, cannot move
 funds rate around, would certainly like move symmetry clause around. think risks
 roughly symmetric now, would definitely support going symmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, favor alternative B also support
 symmetry. almost always favor symmetry. advantage case
 appropriate. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, also support recommendation "B." agree
 risks greater time previous meeting, think
 shift toward downside. So, would favor moving toward symmetry. would suggest,
 though, little unfortunate releasing information Thursday
 going consistent proposal. hope coming back discussion
 disclosure Kohn later point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. scheduled. know,
 contemplating today. could get material together time.
 MR. PARRY. know.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. support recommendation alternative B. Frankly,
 mixed emotions symmetry issue. asked, would probably retain
 asymmetry point, given strong domestic demand, comfortable
 symmetry well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 
 8/18/98
 MR. POOLE. support alternative B. also support symmetrical directive
 think risks far symmetrical previous
 months since became member Committee. would like point key feature
 policy regime recent years market moved rates done lot
 stabilization work us conditions Fed set right long-run environment
 market moved. currently plenty room market move rates higher,
 incoming data start point direction, would anticipate market would
 back quite bit. So, sense, plenty room tightening policy take place
 market. direction, much room, although little, rates
 decline anchored current fed funds rate.
 would mean economic conditions weaken quite bit data come
 coming weeks months, might looking policy easing follow market
 evidence accumulates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, certainly accept "no change"
 recommendation. far symmetries go, accept symmetry without great angst
 think clearly strong case it. would prefer stay asymmetry
 basic structure risks living time still intact view.
 case reorienting directive little moving toward symmetry,
 economic conditions yet changed enough change policy stance. repeat,
 certainly accept symmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 
 8/18/98
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. it's worth, break got
 data used staff calculate median CPI. takes us little longer compute
 number get BLS statistics. number July 3.0 percent. July-to-July,
 2.8 percent. would take best estimate expect next 12 months.
 interesting break down, take position based long historical
 experience case divergence, published CPI almost always converges
 median. divergence occurred October last year March year
 published CPI dropped annual rate 1 percent median stayed right 2.8
 percent. four months since March, published CPI come back annual rate
 2.4 percent. So, one look say monetary policy eased real
 fed funds rate fallen last four months. consistent monetary
 statistics credit aggregates, especially monetary base, pay lot attention to.
 reason taking action restrain monetary growth point would
 either effects developments Asia Russia, though sure quantify that,
 argument tightening would harm therefore refrain
 taking action. Well, really believer tough love. remember periods 1980s
 rolling repeatedly maturing debt Argentina countries give time
 build courage fix problems. really cut
 political dynamics within countries got point willing
 something. listen discussion Asia around table, seems
 people saying countries yet bad enough shape fix.
 know taking action purpose helping creates pressures help
 themselves.

 argument domestic side anything Greenbook

 demand related slowing growth money credit on. forecast. score,
 reminded century date change problems associated computer, whose development
 owes much Marina Whitman's father, John von Neumann, architect modern
 computer system. think ought blame two-digit problem,
 develop basic architecture goes modern computers.
 MS. RIVLIN. think ought blame Alan Greenspan!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. learned John von Neumann!
 MR. JORDAN. thing economists place emphasis
 work Oskar Morgenstern calculus decisionmaking using mathematical
 formulations minimax type. helps us identify kinds errors willing
 make difficult correct. light, still believe
 costly mistake correct one occurs turns excess demand growth
 fact slow down. analysis carefully done mathematically developed von
 Neumann Morgenstern basically says sometimes base decisions something
 believe definitely want, still wisest course
 action.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. support "no change" policy, think risks shifted
 sufficiently justify symmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 
 8/18/98
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation "no change"
 policy. directive, close call. think balance risks still marginally
 upside. So, would slight preference asymmetric directive support
 symmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. prefer alternative B well. place Governor
 Kelley. slight preference continuing asymmetrical directive, least
 longer. seems given extraordinary visibility publicity Asian
 Russian problems, could give much weight today issues
 greater assurance domestic final demand slow pace consistent
 deterioration inflation. also concern confusing signal effect
 delayed announcement symmetry directive, would feel comfortable
 moving symmetrical directive today regime announcing decision
 promptly meeting. However, feel strongly symmetry issue.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First Vice President Varvel.
 MR. VARVEL. would agree downside risks increased, still
 believe upside risks greater, given strength domestic demand. So, would
 continue favor smaller increase fed funds rate sooner rather larger increase
 could well needed later. obviously lot sentiment alternative B around
 table. Given Committee adoption alternative, would favor continuation
 asymmetric tilt.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seems fairly large concentration
 preferences around "B" symmetric. Would read appropriate directive?

 MR. BERNARD. draft directive page 13 Bluebook, follows
 lot charts tables: "In implementation policy immediate future, Committee
 seeks conditions reserve markets consistent maintaining federal funds rate
 average around 5-1/2 percent. context Committee's long-run objectives price
 stability sustainable economic growth, giving careful consideration economic,
 financial, monetary developments, slightly higher federal funds rate slightly lower
