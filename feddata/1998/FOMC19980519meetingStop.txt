 Japan premium phenomenon.

 Let go back issues come up. First, worth
 noting dollar yen premiums come quite bit
 recent days. quite noticeable dollar measure still indicates
 premium 9 10 basis point range. One might ask whether premium
 arbitraged out; ought easy thing arbitrage away. But,
 course, investor would take credit risk implicit
 business Japanese names. interests talk
 bankers, many tell frankly credit lines
 Japanese counterparties completely full. is, traders taking
 maximum advantage trying capture premium arbitrage it.
 bank credit departments charge individual trade-by-trade
 basis, limits. mind, find quite

 ask whether looking single phenomenon measure

 call twin peaks premium--one prior calendar yearend prior fiscal year-end. view premium
 principally liquidity risk, credit risk. would note, however,
 first peak occurred late November began see closures
 Japanese financial institutions, bringing mind larger question credit risk.
 Also, given dubious quality assets balance sheets Japanese
 banks, seem useful time drawing fine
 distinction liquidity credit risks. Japanese bank cannot
 fund really credit risk market counterparty.

 bottom panel place holder show widening corporate spreads,
 expressed Moody's indices found, comparable Japanese

 many people talk fact cannot find deteriorating credit
 spreads markets Japan. suggest Japanese markets work
 way, Western, see deterioration quite
 clearly chart. Secondly, widening spreads banks'
 customers, things getting worse worse them. Finally, think
 useful reminder approaching Japanese bankruptcy season.
 bankruptcies actually occur end fiscal year; take
 place later fiscal year results made public. Much
 thing happened November last year began seeing reports

 although sure many private forecasters

 among wisdom view, purposes setting stage

 First, compensation side, absolutely doubt labor

 unemployment rate registered survey last month, whatever true
 number is, sure workers gained clout pay-setting
 process. Nonetheless, March ECI figures showed wage salary
 increases right line expectations benefit cost increases

 forecast flat nominal compensation inflation: namely, low price
 inflation damp wage increases; repetition
 minimum wage hikes boosted pay rates past couple years;
 that, though health insurance costs increasing rapidly, slowing
 economic expansion take "oomph" commissions

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. think mostly answered question, let pose
 another way. computational changes made CPI masking real price
 increases occurring? words, distinction people really
 experiencing numbers say, computational changes reflecting reality
 people see?
 MR. PRELL. interesting question, may suggest way
 approached prior question right. sense, think changes improvements
 measurement inflation better capture reality. guess suggests
 along people making decisions based something like reality
 published numbers, would perceive, example, real wages going
 faster measured numbers suggest.
 MS. MINEHAN. So, don't see major changes end period
 BEA's computation measure? take 1994 numbers, compare
 projected 1999, adjust measurement differences, get upward trend something
 like .5 percent. don't think trend reassert itself? don't think BEA's
 adjustment masking trend going anyway? think measuring really
 going on?
 MR. PRELL. think numbers better capture reality. also think
 important keep tabs thinking whether acceleration rate

 Michigan Survey, best judge, asking straight questions people without bias. Even
 so, would terribly curious see whether responses come close actual inflation

 MR. PRELL. suspect Michigan survey people might qualms

 So, may may excessive. general, hard escape conclusion

 5/19/98
 
 staff, analytical basis concern might be. would like summarize
 analysis morning, quickly. real interest rate behavior
 might telling us.
 First, seems clear enough stage permanent productivity gains major
 force driving economic expansion. staff revised upward estimate productivity
 growth. revision turn consistent higher level stock prices current
 Greenbook forecast. households similarly beginning think recent real wage
 gains stock gains going sustained, might help explain
 extraordinary current strength consumer demand.
 permanent productivity gains fact driving expansion stage, one
 would expect general economic grounds see higher real interest rates consumers borrow
 expected future income gains firms borrow take advantage favorable investment
 opportunities. Sure enough, real interest rates rising, already relatively high.
 raises key question analysis. possible policy stance still inflationary
 even though real interest rates relatively high level? think it's possible. First,
 technological innovations raised marginal product capital, believe many would
 agree have, firms naturally would willing borrow high real rates finance
 acquisitions new capital. investment boom progresses, one would expect capital
 deepening cause marginal return capital decline time. turn would
 consistent pattern real interest rates current short real rates expected
 future short real rates, resulting downward sloping real yield curve. fact actual
 real yield curve basically flat least raises possibility, even though real rates high,
 monetary policy holding current short real rates level trying
 
 5/19/98
 reach. Given possibility, think bottom line may want take much
 comfort, standpoint evaluating policy stance, fact real rates
 rising fairly high.
 Finally, possibility policy easy seems made
 likely strong growth M2 monetary aggregates, least recently.
 growth carried M2 1998 target cone even one point, reading
 Bluebook picture correctly, wider band used refer around
 Volcker tunnel. bottom line still think good reason analytically
 fundamentally concerned inflation even though seen much lately.

 fundamentals continue look positive. impressive momentum domestic demand;

 Still, three factors likely weigh expansion going forward. First,

 Second, external drag combination emerging Asian economies,

 Third, positive impulse stock market least diminish, partly

 interaction inventory correction external drag perhaps help
 stock market, potential significant slowing immediately ahead. Still,
 question much longer one wait slowdown especially
 light fact growth consistently outperformed expectations last two years
 light tight indeed tighter labor markets.
 last meeting, members Committee expressed following concern
 wage pressures context tight labor markets. quote minutes: "but
 additional improvements productivity growth could counted offset increases
 rate growth labor compensation, likely occur labor markets
 tighten further." staff, however, plan higher productivity growth offset
 effects tighter labor markets, least while. much central forecast.
 
 5/19/98
 
 staff's decision raise productivity growth reflected assessment two new
 pieces data: adjusted productivity series, reflecting correction data hours--the
 length pay period--and report multifactor productivity indicated faster growth
 capital services 1996. followed lag discount factor staff's earlier upward
 revision estimate trend productivity growth. Perhaps ultimately follow
 revision well now; reservations. lower estimate staff's higher
 estimate work equally well explaining recent decline unemployment via Okun's
 Law. adjusted productivity series provides hint sharper break trend rate
 productivity growth mid-1995 hint judgment definitive enough
 taste justify upward revision estimate trend. Indeed, assuming constant

 trend rate productivity. case difference estimated trend whether
 published adjusted productivity data used. trend also identical trend estimated
 earlier 1974 1990 period. staff's analysis suggestive definitely got
 attention, appears recent robust productivity growth explained
 combination modest increase productivity normal cyclical rebound.
 inflation wage data? developments since last
 meeting make us less concerned potential acceleration wages? Let focus
 first recent data core CPI. staff projected 2.2 percent rate increase
 measure 1998 1999, 1997. consistent methodological basis,
 however, translates increase 2.2 percent 1997 2.4 percent 1998
 2.7 percent 1999. first question inflation whether trend core CPI stable

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. excellent balanced

 First, agree number view Asian crisis international

 Indonesian markets, know, exceptionally weak effectively shut down.

 interesting question whether, even decide bubble

 So, wary notion small 25 50 basis point move could permanently

 action appropriate. believe notion merely hitting market illusion.
 may something could discuss great length chapter textbook, doubt
 much know implement policy point view.
 third crucial issue come today relates wages productivity.
 agree ECI changed far modest pace one would expected
 basis past Phillips curve calculations. compensation per hour figures running somewhat
 higher fact tend negate conclusion one draws ECI. So, interesting
 question set data appropriate. question mind ECI,
 properly measured, reflect wage structure. suspect, however, periods like
 present extreme shortages certain skills workforce, lot increases
 labor compensation showing higher wages given job rather promotions
 like way business firms avoid certain internal problems. overall
 effect cannot large, size. So, would somewhat less sanguine
 might otherwise good ECI numbers look, though way getting
 around fact wage pattern somewhat subdued.
 interesting data beginning emerge provide
 increasing evidence underlying trend productivity moving up. One disregard
 noncorporate sector, think abnormally constrains number use total nonfarm
 productivity, look area data clearer--that is, nonfinancial corporate
 sector. is, course, statistical discrepancy output data spending side,
 even make adjustments noncorporate area, data income side.
 advantage looking productivity income side, BLS formerly did,
 income side internally consistent price numbers. reconciliation productivity
 
 5/19/98
 
 prices, dealing output measured spending side, requires us make
 judgment handle increasing statistical discrepancy, whereas dealing
 income side eliminates need. I'm saying one approach superior
 pure measure productivity, wanted point income side approach easier
 way get price relationships.
 said that, published productivity data nonfinancial corporations
 shown modest decline last three years 3 percent rate four quarters
 ended first quarter 1996 2.7 percent four quarters ended first quarter
 year. However, hours data adjusted length pay period problem,
 comparison reverses significantly. Instead going 3.0 2.7 percent last two
 years, productivity growth goes 2.7 3.2 percent, 3.2 percent staff's estimate
 rate four quarters ended first quarter year. first quarter
 estimated 3.4 percent annual rate increase estimated increase manufacturing
 month April .8 percent. So, find difficult set aside evidence data
 indeed accelerating.
 staff put together set data essence cyclically adjusts numbers
 observe productivity growth nonfinancial corporate sector would looked fixed
 operating rate, i.e. neutralizing business cycle. While, course, growth productivity
 somewhat slower, marginally slower. pronounced acceleration trend starting
 early 1995 unaffected.
 may recall argument made year ago explanation required
 sharp increase capital investment, especially high-tech areas, started 1993
 persisted since then. One explanation, fact necessary explanation, plant managers
 
 5/19/98
 involved planning capital investments anticipated significant increase
 prospective real rates return facilities could achieved result emerging new
 technologies. mistake part, one would expected capital investment
 run year two start lower-than-anticipated rates
 return actually showed up. Instead, anything whole process accelerated. one
 calculate real rates return implicit sharp rise investment, think one would
 find actual real rates return gone up, done calculation yet.
 know real profits risen therefore actual incremental profit gone up,
 sure whether gone denominator, capital investment
 applies.
 clear significant acceleration productivity occurred compared
 previous trend. goodly part, perhaps though all, attributable pickup
 rate capital deepening. clearly improvements
 quality labor, residual, call total factor productivity, gone
 well. getting significant advances capital spending total factor
 productivity suggest increase real rates return, trying explain
 labor productivity rising. Labor productivity clearly accelerated, done
 interaction sharp rise capital investment occurred. So, strikes

 discontinuous pickup productivity growth started 1995.
 another set observations also quite important around-thetable discussion economic outlook. Bill Poole referred issue number

 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, last meeting expressed concern that, even

 tightening might needed later. Nothing happened since last meeting change
 perception need. anything, domestic economy gotten stronger financial
 markets. Price pressures remain low sure, continue believe result

 certainly arguments persuasive that, wonder whether productivity

 view monetary policy accommodative right now. think much
