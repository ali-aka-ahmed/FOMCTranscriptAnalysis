 Transcript Federal Open Market Committee Meeting
 September 29, 1998
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. getting way bit early, sure
 use time productively. Would somebody like move approval minutes? want
 call attention addition reference minutes recent telephone
 conference. trust looked objection way
 worded.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 second item agenda involves continuation discussions we've
 issue disclosure. memorandum, staff winnowed earlier considerations,
 options seem fairly straightforward. urgency implement them,
 think continue discussions reach consensus sort.
 strictly matter Committee vote. Whatever do, including nothing,
 important reflect consensus differentiated majority vote. don't think change
 procedures made majority vote change made
 difficult backtrack. result, change something everyone
 feels reasonably comfortable. said that, would somebody like respond
 memorandum, sets issues way seem require staff briefing?
 President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, reading memo participating several
 discussions question, inclination go Option 1. regard option,
 simpler straightforward language, better. Indeed, would simplify
 
 9/29/98
 
 language even further. symmetric alternative, would say something like "in view
 currently available evidence, Committee believes developments equally likely
 warrant decrease increase federal funds rate." decision tilt,
 would sentence say "in view currently available evidence, Committee
 believes developments likely warrant decrease/increase increase/
 decrease federal funds rate." think wording understandable straightforward.
 also would like see minutes released even sooner contemplated
 memo physically possible. That's because, said last time discussed
 matter, minutes provide context Committee's decision. going
 transparent, sooner better later regard. know physical limitations
 involved production minutes.
 sum, preference would put simpler language directive, release
 promptly, publish minutes soon give context decision.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. gather implication concluded
 previous discussions variations wording describe differing degrees tilt
 served us well. know, past hard tilts, medium tilts, tilted tilts,
 biased tilts, knows else!
 MR. HOENIG. need interpreter figure means. true
 even us, let alone public.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, share Tom Hoenig's views pretty much
 line. come this, said last time, sense information put
 promptly, better. quickly markets react, policy uncertainty premiums
 
 9/29/98
 
 might otherwise get built markets reduced. So, would favor announcing
 tilt immediately meeting releasing minutes sooner.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, also say favored releasing tilt
 immediately?
 MR. HOENIG. Yes, would favor releasing promptly meeting
 simpler, clearer language.
 MR. GUYNN. think important continue discussion sure
 objectives. view, first foremost objective make intent
 clear. think staff really nice job page 2 memo express
 sense mean tilt, namely reflects Committee's thinking
 balance risks. current understanding primary reason tilt language.
 believe secondary intent continue practice giving Chairman authority
 act Committee extraordinary circumstances. assume two things
 trying accomplish.
 think announcing tilt would negative effect Committee's
 discussion, although issue raised staff memo. fact, would argue might
 even strengthen discussion favored action meeting none
 taken would least benefit tilt announced immediately, whatever
 effect might market. also satisfied Fed watchers others pay
 attention tilt smart enough realize circumstances may change events unfold
 meeting. Thus, expect next action always direction tilt.
 also share Tom Hoenig's view releasing minutes. assume
 able publish minutes sooner days next meeting suggested
 staff memo. Since minutes elaborate reasoning behind tilt, think sooner
 
 9/29/98
 
 release them, better served. also share Tom's preference simpler language
 tilt, would incorporate simpler language staff memo changes Tom
 suggested. also would reword lead sentence indicate Committee seeks conditions
 reserve markets consistent mandate foster longer-run price stability
 sustained economic growth.
 Finally, wonder whether consider dropping last sentence
 operating paragraph, references growth M2 M3. sentence may suggest
 Committee aggregates policy objective, question whether relevant
 terms way currently conduct policy. However, may issue don't want
 open time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. central bank, least recognize M2
 M3 exist, matter them. [Laughter]
 MR. GUYNN. accept that! Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. much agreement Presidents Hoenig Guynn.
 favor Option 1, prompt release meeting, simpler language. I, too, tried draft
 language would underscore concept risk Tom Jack seemed
 referring. also believe minutes released sooner 2 3 days
 next meeting, possible.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. basically support three Presidents preceded said
 making prompt announcement, would release operational paragraph
 change tilt. say find language Option 2 relating tilt
 somewhat preferable Option 1, though certainly better
 
 9/29/98
 
 today. Option 2, seems me, captures essential element asymmetry refers
 likelihood move policy one direction rather other, think
 highly desirable. like Option 1 reference long-run goals. So,
 combination Options 1 2 would preference.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. play devil's advocate, would like suggest we'd
 better formally voting tilt. Therefore, wouldn't decision make
 release vote. understand tilt option may help consensus
 building arriving decision given meeting, get sense
 group leaning without necessarily voting it. would run fewer risks creating
 embarrassing situations getting ready zig said previous meeting
 likely zag. think would greater degree freedom
 Committee formal tilt listened knew way
 leaning without take vote.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. agree Option 1 amended Tom Hoenig. thought staff
 draft quite good breakthrough terms added clarity straightforwardness, Tom
 made bit better. suspect happen know announcing tilt
 less likely one. may, considerable degree uncertainty,
 take refuge tilt directive, seems appropriate me. reason
 tilt want send signal way leaning. sure enough
 signal, ought say so. don't need signal ourselves; need signal
 somebody else. So, public matter. also think would desirable get
 
 9/29/98
 
 minutes sooner could. important breakthrough straightforward language
 tilt announcing immediately.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. continue favor immediate announcement tilt. thought Tom
 Hoenig Jack Guynn presented arguments extremely well, believe Tom improved
 draft language little. recognize danger immediate announcement
 could reduce use tilt. However, disciplined, avoid honestly
 communicate public exactly assess risks going forward. tilt
 does. Releasing minutes quickly would constructive step toward
 incremental transparency, think would good idea.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, continue believe information
 clearer information, better. So, agree majority here. like language
 Option 1, think Tom Hoenig improved it. Tom's changes, option strikes
 huge improvement now. would release directive immediately
 release minutes early possible.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. agree simpler language. I, too, think Tom
 improved it, would go that. realize it's difficult providing
 information, continue problems immediate release tilt.
 information general matter, believe practical outcome prompt release
 decision tilt would less use it. Monetary policy take place vacuum.
 takes place wider social political environment. environment, almost
 always easier lower interest rates raise them. planning raise interest
 
 9/29/98
 
 rates, may well get real bang buck actually it. say might raise
 fail so, going get inevitable announcement effect
 associated criticism it. "announcement" effect later
 nothing happens. think go exercise times conclude really
 worth doing. acting direction tilt may also erode credibility. tilt
 may useful internal deliberations, would using less adopting
 symmetric directives frequently. So, real doubts kind disclosure would
 actually contribute clarity. therefore misgivings moving direction
 majority opinion appears going.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. certainly favor earlier release
 minutes clarifying language regard tilt lack thereof. Like Bob Parry,
 mild preference something like Option 2, doesn't seem huge
 difference two versions read them.
 share Ed Boehne's reservations immediate release decision
 tilt. Historically, seems noisy signal frequently
 tilt changed tilt nothing followed. gives pause. I'm sure
 going intended results kind release, least point time. So,
 I'm favor immediate release least now, would prefer hold making
 decision.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. seems growing majority here,
 recognize counter arguments. I'm favor immediately releasing tilt mainly
 it's question honesty. consensus emerged Committee says
 
 9/29/98
 
 risks moved certain direction therefore policy may follow, think useful
 inform market. posture release tilt end
 number people trying interpret speeches responses questions
 way may conform thinking. think releasing tilt promptly give us
 chance much clearer market, signal one voice opposed potentially 19
 voices, certain reached consensus, tell market
 consensus is.
 also would happy encourage earlier release minutes sense
 provide fuller context decisions. language, slight preference
 Option 1 amended Tom Hoenig, support Option 2 well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. I, too, like Option 1, would prefer tilt language Option 2.
 think earliest possible release minutes, consistent written clearly
 informatively, good idea. would like add cannot imagine better time
 introduce new procedures right now, given things going on.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, releasing tilt
 sentence entire directive paragraph promptly meeting minutes soon
 possible thereafter. language directive paragraph, Option 1. Let point
 one difference Option 1 Option 2; Option 1 states Committee's goals
 first sentence goes say Committee did; Option 2 reverses order. However
 describe tilt, would like preserve aspect Option 1. is, would state
 goals first indicate did.
 
 9/29/98
 
 agree Bill Poole adopt changes today, although may
 make us little less aggressive changing directive language. agree Tom
 Hoenig said, unlike Bob McTeer, would like retain tilt directive. One thing
 worried about, said past, way make policy could
 allow us get rigid federal funds rate. keep tilt, little less rigid,
 would like retain reason.
 last point regarding credibility Ed Boehne made Gary Stern
 seconded, impressed since short people's memories are. Six
 weeks fairly long interval terms monetary events, great deal
 speculation going today much remembered
 six weeks ago. I'm worried credibility issue change
 position change minds think would viewed context whether good
 thing light recent events. don't think would lose credibility. So,
 inclined downplay argument.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, think might worth
 thinking change it. One realities
 releasing minutes meeting two days following meeting, decision tilt
 earlier meeting may interesting longer important. already
 decided either ease ease tighten tighten meeting took place
 two days before. thought use tilt served cause well?
 view helped us focus want terms guiding policy one
 meeting next least terms longer-term view headed. think
 served us well.
 
 9/29/98
 
 decide release minutes earlier, probably good
 idea, analysis collective psychology group fact, Alice Rivlin
 suggested, whole lot "tilting." reason going announce
 tilt either right away shortly next meeting releasing minutes early,
 create difficult conundrum central bank. Central bankers supposed
 believers price stability. Even symmetric approach inflation, think
 many us are, sense opposed inflation deflation, public
 believes central bankers supposed inflation fighters. remind
 every deflation also. envision us sitting around table
 saying ought directive biased toward tightening, us would
 say ought go ahead tighten. want tighten meeting,
 would better announce meeting thinking later.
 latter would view make us look little questionable judgment least
 strength character. hand, thinking easing sure
 want ease given meeting, people would conclude rather reasonable thing
 central bankers doing. So, early announcement would wind view
 real world likely tilt toward easing less likely tilt toward firming.
 Even though believe would good idea principle release minutes
 early, therefore don't feel strongly whether announce tilt absence
 tilt shortly meeting, think likely announcement use tilt
 would become fairly rare phenomenon. time think economic
 conditions, financial markets, monetary conditions might appropriate
 ease monetary policy point, good central bankers might entirely sure
 
 9/29/98
 
 need easing quite yet, would it. Therefore, I'm sure would
 accomplish changing procedures.
 summarize, prompt announcements make us look like believers transparency;
 good. make us look like sharing information American people;
 good. terms actually serving interests American people well--and think
 phenomenally good job regard, leaving collective modesty aside--I
 sure change announcement procedures would improve performance.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, tend agree President Boehne also
 President McDonough. hard argue transparency. Obviously, want
 release much information possible. design system start,
 cannot imagine would design system would require us make two decisions. One
 might decision maintain unchanged policy decision whether
 want tell world might tightening easing later. Alternatively, might take
 action announce shortly meeting whether directive includes either two
 tilts. seem logical central bank would want that.
 used tilt purposes, trying design system around
 history. wouldn't design way start afresh didn't take account
 use past.
 believe agree announce tilt time next
 meeting, practical result would would use much less. Actually, though,
 existing system seems working rather well. unusual circumstances August
 meeting changed symmetric directive. July minutes, released shortly
 meeting, indicated upward bias. interim, August meeting
 
 9/29/98
 
 September meeting, Chairman consulted us Jackson Hole,
 subsequently announced directive longer upward bias. So, think that,
 whole, system announcing decisions worked rather well years
 see need change point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. regard minutes, agree releasing
 soon prepared, even though releasing sooner impose burden
 staff us review approve them.
 release tilt, though, persuaded number comments today
 release immediately, use it. Therefore, want release tilt immediately!
 [Laughter] persuaded time costs tilt outweigh benefits terms
 consensus building. always thought monetary policy operates
 price basis, run problems terms interactions marketplace announce
 intention change interest rates certain direction time. markets move
 kind information, opposed way tend function quantitative
 approach implementing policy.
 regard wording options, like Bob Parry Ned Gramlich, like
 way Option 1 begins statement objectives. Regarding tilt sentence, though,
 like Option 1 states "the Committee believes developments
 likely warrant....etc." immediately starts raise questions developments
 involved indicators flashing red, yellow, green trigger action. puts undue
 weight signal may lead change policy. Option 2 that.
 agree Governor Gramlich's comment federal funds rate tended
 rigid, sense tilt frequently used lieu making policy
 
 9/29/98
 
 change. tilt may serve function terms building onsensus,
 available, would straight votes. would change policy
 would not.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, discussed issue earlier, spoke
 length idea early release still feel same. would like restate views
 briefly, may, even though concerns already expressed. First all,
 please recall Lindsey paper supported earlier discussion showed
 past 12 years, tilt place time FOMC decision direction
 decision 52.7 percent time. 47.3 percent time, decision
 differed existing tilt. Thus, tilt nearly perfectly worthless predictor
 policy decisions. [Laughter]
 view, problems give us three reasons change
 announcement practices, provide notion results would
 did. First, record shows early release past decade would frequently
 misled general public, concerned deeds fine nuances
 economic reasoning. consequence, convinced early release would
 experience severe loss credibility lifeblood policy's effectiveness. Second,
 early release asymmetry would often equivalent policy move
 Committee decided take, Committee could never know voted
 forces might inadvertently setting motion hour later announcement
 made. Third, asymmetry place meeting issues close,
 existence publicly known 6- 8-week old position could influence adoption less
 optimal new policy.
 
 9/29/98
 
 consequence this, confident that, burned couple times,
 Committee would simply cease employ useful convention. would
 shame tilt legitimizes uncertainty frequently present delay
 frequently appropriate, also aids materially building consensus. sum, see
 helpful elements early release regimen many serious negative consequences.
 rewording directive, truth tell like existing language would
 little sad see go. Everyone interested needs know understands perfectly
 well, importantly constitutes bit quaint Americana cherish.
 [Laughter] said, would support change Committee's wish, either
 two wording options suggested amendments perfectly acceptable me. Option 1
 fine, think much said Option 2 greater continuity
 present practice. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One things strikes discussion,
 must admit sides issue, switch back forth different
 sides different times. reason pressed something consider
 value market, namely information better less. also
 ethical issue here, one relating integrity institution, clearly important issue
 need address. considerations suggest better, although
 must remember going way providing information. went
 fullest extent direction, Henry Gonzalez's approach live transmission
 meeting obviously would ethical directly available source information
 market, also would useless. So, let us careful weigh
 various alternatives.
 
 9/29/98
 
 one thing struck me, surfaced discussion today,
 experience last several years experience much
 longer time frame. is, nature deliberations way conduct monetary
 policy quite different economy extreme stress, unemployment
 rate rising, cacophony outside comments need lower interest
 rates-- sort commentary seldom get economy strong. So,
 little cautious proceeding without availing lessons past
 experience regard things may play period, say, economy getting
 away us downside looking fairly dramatic decline demand, rising
 unemployment, lot political stirring. think would important us work
 number alternative scenarios context. that, think we're going
 find issue lot problematical may currently appear. think ought
 that. discussion clarify, unless misheard, general willingness abandon
 quaint Americanism-SEVERAL. Americana.
 MR. KELLEY. Americana.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seem fairly broad consensus
 desirability better simpler language.
 
 However, yet come together
 
 issues; vote taken issues, think would majority
 favor something now, still significant minority side.
 regard wording directive, first time sensed existence
 general agreement though remain small differences. would recommend put
 together language reflects, best judge, consensus group revisit
 
 9/29/98
 
 matter later meeting. make change, think ready
 part wrestled issue long period time.
 two quite different disclosure issues. One giving changes tilt
 status changes funds rate respect announced.
 second, see may viewed independent first, publish
 minutes. certain sympathy views Vice Chair latter. often
 wondered would gain releasing minutes week earlier current schedule
 information tilt already out. grant tilt announced shortly
 meeting, moving publication minutes clearly effect releasing
 tilt point. tilt already published, acceleration minutes strikes
 something probably potential mischief not. Remember
 minutes provide discussion various forces nuances like,
 decide publish one week earlier, two three weeks earlier?
 general agreement within Committee contingency discussions contained
 minutes published contingencies longer relevance. So,
 think issues whether publish tilt point decisionmaking
 release minutes separable. necessarily tied.
 Unless hear objection, would like Kohn construct

 Hoenig's amendment. believe come agreement next meeting issue.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.

 would appropriate time. I, like Ed Boehne, would cautious deliberate

 First, course, weakness forecast. Domestic weakness yet here. fact, labor

 workers still strong sectors. GDP likely grow trend quarter

 worrisome view transmission financial weakness abroad financial markets

 surprise weakness emanate investment activities firms period

 Fortunately, distinguished colleague, Mr. Fisher, could remain New York

 saw it, intervention preferable letting firm collapse belief

 Peter Fisher good portion implementation.
 Peter held series meetings, climactic meeting occurred last Wednesday
 15 firms represented. began meeting explaining possible

 subsequent series meetings, details finally worked

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bill, room think firms

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Could go back tell us know
 position bank examiners regarding practices, think described less
 optimal, followed institutional lenders LTCP?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Richard Spillenkothen might able pick
 better. staff group Board Governors New York Reserve Bank
 made number visits last December major banks, national banks state member
 banks, put memorandum subject April.
 MR. SPILLENKOTHEN. probably point on-site
 examination. staffs met managements institutions. think came away
 feeling that, generally speaking, banks saying right things terms
 kinds risk management processes place. bankers talked lot
 involvement hedge funds becoming bigger part overall business activities,
 noted actually staff managed relationships big hedge
 funds nature business. gathered bankers indicating
 
 9/29/98
 
 policies procedures place deal fairly effective way risks
 generally involved.
 terms situation, think issues either going forward
 threefold. One extent banks actually applying risk management
 policies course activities. application policies looked
 context examination process. indicated memorandum, Bill McDonough
 mentioned, area needed continue focus course
 examination process. Secondly, terms issues here, think robustness
 banks applied policies adversely affected perception reputation
 people ran LTCM/P. final point terms lessons learned, lot focus
 collateral collateral management. One thing experience
 underscored--and actually known time--is collateral one aspect
 overall control credit risk, replacement banks' analysis
 overall creditworthiness borrower.
 point, think banks right policies procedures place.
 question effectively banks implementing policies procedures.
 people visiting three major state member banks today, tomorrow

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Rich, could well that, rapid

 MR. SPILLENKOTHEN. Yes, previous exam probably would
 middle 1997. exam would year old. That's question
 go back take look at.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. vulnerable regard

 rarely come situation say awful, institution falling

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Daiwa, yes. Daiwa exposed complex

 need stage sense whether examining
 specifically actually happened LTCM situation. private sector,
 remember looking details particular loans shown bank directors.
 loan committee one major banking institutions, actually went
 loan portfolio major client major client. bank's senior loan officers would provide
 basic review. would take loan portfolio point vulnerabilities strengths
 borrowers give evaluations risks involved. review quite
 thorough. knew getting bit snow job--the type thing mistakes never
 made everything perfect. even adjusting that, examination level
 would allowed LTCP problem happen. happen number
 extraordinarily effective counterparties involved. question happened
 
 9/29/98
 
 case. lenders dazzled people LTCM take close
 look?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think place credit management
 system appeared make great deal sense.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Whose? LTCM's?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. No, lenders, including institution
 associated. One may question notion least lenders
 initial margin requirement. Beyond issue, emphasized
 lenders good collateral management systems LTCP began lose
 position, would need put added collateral place. get hands around
 conceptually whether something missed could provided us
 notion big overall position LTCP become. don't know
 could done that. regulate firm. given number institutions
 dealt around world, way enabled us aware
 overall position? One inclined say, "you bet." exactly could done
 sure.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Somebody mentioned Bankers Trust
 August balance sheet LTCM. true?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes, balance sheet relatively small
 piece whole action much latter off-balance-sheet.
 MR. FISHER. don't think August balance sheet September 1.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. may one now.
 MR. FISHER. may one weekend, eight days ago. don't
 think anyone seen one weekend September 19 20.
 
 9/29/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one thing one bank failed appreciate
 happening LTCP, list institutions mind boggling.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. tells us something
 way financial services institutions group dealing least firm
 allowed position built dangerous.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. type collateral would ordinarily required

 MR. FISHER. Let try answer line inquiry, Mr. Chairman,
 hypothesis. want clear hypothesis. August 31, firm

 billion assets repo. assets firm. One kind transaction
 counterparties repo transaction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Involving U.S. Treasuries?
 MR. FISHER. U.S. Treasuries, Danish government bonds, BBB credits--you name it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. lot triple Bs outstanding.
 MR. FISHER. fair amount government credit assets,
 lot assets also. Swap agreements instrument choice,
 got $1.45 trillion off-balance-sheet position August 31. time
 looking position weekend eight days ago, firm clearly lost lot

 off-balance-sheet shrunk around one trillion dollars third week September.
 balance sheet leverage ratio 55 1 time looked. off-balance-sheet

 System's point view, zero initial margin permits essentially unlimited amount

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. biblical justice situation
 principals LTCM apparently believed firmly system would continue work
 appear borrowed rather heavily increase risk positions firm.
 So, general spreading belief may extraordinarily elegant people
 private bankruptcy court fairly near future.
 MS. RIVLIN. many LTCMs there?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. know hedge fund
 would remotely size LTCM/P. John Meriwether it, certainly would
 
 9/29/98
 
 smart individuals computers could engage sort activity.
 So, little versions LTCM/P. well known hedge funds

 MR. MEYER. get way F-6 study systemic risk, think
 important episode us study. trying decide systemic risk

 that. Secondly, supervisory issue. think going called explain
 whether examinations sources information provided us

 also issue would remiss least mention, namely
 overseeing lending investment decisions get made. Rather well along
 process, getting telephone calls reporters knew LTCM did.
 don't think way been.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let go back. explain how,
 everybody 100 percent collateralized--not 110 100 percent--we end huge
 losses lenders?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. lenders continue collateralized
 firm starts lose money long firm capital continue provide added
 collateral make losses. losses continue mount, firm point-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But, looking losses value
 collateral collateral withdrawn? bank lender lend $200 million
 
 9/29/98
 
 hedge fund, ordinarily would over-collateralized. would hold $200 million in,
 say, U.S. Treasury bills.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Remember, day one initial

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. talking position bank lending
 LTCM.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. made loan since

 MR. TRUMAN. collateral margin.
 MR. FISHER. lend $100 LTCP give asset worth $100.
 market value asset goes 5 percent today, give back $5 dollars; goes 5
 percent tomorrow give $5 dollars.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. 100 percent collateralized mark-to-market
 position.
 MR. FISHER. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Now, order bank lose situation,
 either find collateral legally available certain circumstances
 market value declined. case?
 MR. FISHER. latter. collateral lost market value.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, collateral lost value LTCP
 resources make loss.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That's right.
 MR. FISHER. want clear, Mr. Chairman. talking balance sheet
 $125 billion off-balance-sheet $1.4 trillion. Now, know total
 
 9/29/98
 
 collateralized 100 cents dollar. balance sheet financing fully
 collateralized.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's leave derivatives out.
 MR. FISHER. realize notional, know scale notionals.
 MR. TRUMAN. off-balance-sheet presumably goes way balance
 sheet.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. two ways coming this. certain
 transactions counterparties derivatives net positions fully collateralized
 X percent cases collateral all. Straight lending usually fully
 collateralized. don't know bankers going write losses, I'm
 trying get losses banks coming from. looking
 uncollateralized derivative positions went LTCP favor bank,
 theoretically net position $20 million discovers really $20 million credit
 problem? words, losses coming best see?
 MR. SPILLENKOTHEN. Initially, transactions derivatives sense
 unsecured. exposure reached certain point, lender, bank, right
 demand collateral cover that. is, mark-to-market position current
 exposure built certain point, banks asked collateral. According
 numbers now, appears mark-to-market positions big institutions
 largely covered collateral. So, seem much loss current
 mark-to-market positions derivatives positions. One problems potential
 future exposure. going say English. markets keep moving away
 wrong direction, future exposure could large might
 collateral point time cover exposure.
 
 9/29/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. different issue. far bookkeeping
 concerned, banks book anticipatory losses unless real commitments
 involved. trying focus losses coming from.
 MR. FISHER. Let try work sources losses
 discussed. Long-Term Capital Management analysis top 17 counterparties
 12 trades. represented small percent hundreds trades
 books, big trades. example, 2 12 losses $1/2 billion
 period 30 days; offsets involving complicated transactions.
 scenario LTCM worked attempted take account negative movements
 asset markets. is, market moved position direction
 liquidation likely occur, would acceleration losses. neither
 people LTCM others looked thought meltdown scenario involved.
 losses actually result discrete bad days markets.
 generated counterparty loss $2.8 billion spread among top 17 lenders.
 time net asset value collateral $1 billion $1 billion plus,
 $1-1/2 billion losses shared among top counterparties. think
 number us eyeballed analysis thought one thing focus trades
 question; trades firms included, direct loss could rise $3
 $5 billion. number firms actively looking numbers also
 thought plausible forecast liquidation scenario involving top 17 lenders.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. suggest would valuable
 Committee, us, would make certain assumptions market developments
 see bookkeeping effects would be. firm X suffer loss
 relationship LTCP? gets us sophisticated accounting complex analyses
 
 9/29/98
 
 losses. think trying make estimates fly, going give
 accurate description really works.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think going need testimony
 Thursday general summary examiners, often it, banks
 huge amount experience lending got caught kind thing. need
 answer. answer happened. Part banking involves losing
 money. Banks never make loan expect repaid. sense, every loss
 error. issue define error.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. agree going need
 information testimony, prepared people sitting
 end table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. indicate find answers,
 fine. issue responsiveness Federal Reserve going
 be.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. assume one things want
 talk fact staff, conducting examinations,
 meeting management people examine nature dealing hedge
 funds. report, staff mentioned LTCM/P one customers
 institutions. learn there? might learned addition?
 asleep. think write testimony, already process,
 
 9/29/98
 
 story. fully convincing story problem happen, know
 case. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. care produce accurate testimony.
 MS. RIVLIN. agree.
 MR. FISHER. would like offer one final perspective numbers
 discussed. One surprises people went look LTCP's position,
 included, tremendous size equity equity volatility positions. People knew
 dabbling sector markets, everyone including lot press
 thought LTCP fixed-income shop. firms looked LTCP's position
 detail I, weekend investigate, felt preponderance
 exposure, one uses $3 $5 billion number, needed stabilized equity
 position equity volatility position. That's trades LTCP total-rate-of-return
 swaps. lesser part losses fixed-income financing area. So, bigger risk
 huge equity volatility position LTCP taken on.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. One things able
 say Congress whether state-chartered banks supervise participated equity
 piece not. know answer point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. developed series questions
 testimony asking ourselves? think would useful. words,
 testimony identify questions yet know answer.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. say know,
 say know trying find out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. full report know
 
 know.
 
 9/29/98
 
 MR. FERGUSON. Two questions come mind. One relates reports
 institutions lenders also investors. Those, presume, mainly
 investment banks. think also section 20s others may
 involved?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. foreign bank, UBS,
 large investor investment accounted good chunk loss bank announced
 last Thursday.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. participate American affiliate
 directly Switzerland?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think Switzerland,
 fact establish. also reported press senior officers
 securities firms, think banks, involved individuals either
 retained earnings fund senior executives institutions directly investors
 Long-Term Capital Management.
 MR. FERGUSON. question one also ask make sure
 answer. involves issue similar one Larry Meyer raising.
 experience sense bring question approach taking respect
 risk-based supervision? extent, involves it. need
 figure approach might adjusted based experience.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. tells move toward risk-based
 supervision right way going.
 MS. RIVLIN. right! [Laughter]
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. try get enough facts make sure
 say doing. needed give intelligent
 
 9/29/98
 
 answer question. sound little anxious, people writing
 testimony involved discussion, including me. Much want share
 you, sitting Mr. Leach 10:00 a.m. Thursday morning.
 There's lot work done then.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would like ask one quick factual question
 legal counsel. Virgil, raised issue respect whether fact particular group
 new investors LTCM investing violation 5 percent equity cap.
 concluded, anything, question?
 MR. MATTINGLY. know happened, suspect fund
 gotten rid everything 5 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, compliance Bank Holding Company
 Act?
 MR. MATTINGLY. Nobody told us, read paper
 dumping equities, assume trying get 5 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ah! explains it!
 MR. MATTINGLY. Mr. Chairman, banks take equity position
 LTCM satisfaction previously contracted debt, foreign banks may
 reached 5 percent limit Bank Holding Company Act.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. follow Alice's question, tell know
 lot large hedge funds like LTCP there, accidents waiting happen.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. know? know.
 MR. GRAMLICH. know!
 
 9/29/98
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. usual antennae out.
 learned variety sources LTCM/P getting trouble. surmise
 basis happened spreads that, although may get worse, anybody
 opportunity get trouble certainly tremendous opportunity. nothing else, one
 would think rumor mill would brought attention firm X
 difficulties. hear kinds rumors financial markets, heard
 hedge fund would appear remotely size macroeconomic risk potential
 LTCM/P.
 MR. FISHER. something signature firm insist
 counterparty wanted deal them, would initial margin. many firms
 gotten away that.
 MR. GRAMLICH. goes bedazzlement effect.
 MS. MINEHAN. might mention something found came bit
 surprise, namely loans made large lenders participated out.
 So, see shares banks District collateralized uncollateralized lines
 LTCM/P.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think two major credit lines, one
 drawn down. $900 million line slightly $500 million
 drawn participated out. think, however, transactions
 talking involve counterparties rather syndications.
 MS. MINEHAN. realize least two syndicated pools.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes, one management company one
 partnership.
 
 9/29/98
 
 MS. MINEHAN. wondering whether showed review

 MR. PARRY. program produce default loan?
 MR. SPILLENKOTHEN. No.
 MR. PARRY. investments part DPC [debt previously
 contracted], Virgil?
 MR. MATTINGLY. anticipating market would move
 would lose position. DPC exemption require actual default.
 exemption also available anticipation default.
 MR. STERN. Another form collateral!
 MR. SPILLENKOTHEN. looks though current positions covered
 collateral, issue potential future exposure markets. pin numbers
 down, numbers I've seen, looks though pretty good job getting
 collateral cover mark-to-market positions. potential future exposures seem rather
 large, materialize market conditions one wonder
 collateral would come future. part problem.
 MR. PARKINSON. would like draw analogy. may know, use
 VAR model measure market risk. danger analysis cover potential
 losses extremely volatile situations. markets stress testing uncover
 exposures there. distinction important here, think lies heart
 problem. LTCM using VAR-type model, basic technology VAR,
 measure potential future exposure. model estimates exposure normal markets
 
 9/29/98
 
 basis one-day movements, perhaps 95 percent confidence level. deal
 kind markets seeing today. latter extremely volatile currently illiquid.
 example, Peter Fisher talked equity option positions. Now, suppose investors
 close positions try replace going market. liquidity
 whatsoever market. completely illiquid. think emphasis initial margin
 actually misplaced. reason investors decided collect initial margin,
 would collected enough margin cover estimate potential future exposure.
 hypothesis, seriously underestimated exposure, would still left serious
 shortfall margin.
 MR. FISHER. relates question financing got big
 nobody realized happening.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. technically happens kind model

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, exactly.
 
 9/29/98
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. careful
 horrendous experience was, assume normal market Russians
 going default week, cost capital would go high nobody would ever invest
 anything.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. whole point. special cases.
 fact, colleagues know, favorite speech one discuss separating
 risks confront monetary authority risks commercial banks face.
 always argued commercial banks responsible 99.95 percent risks

 going forward turn create expectations monetary policy. So, issue clearly
 FOMC matter view, appreciate brought Committee. problem,
 course, time FOMC deliberate situation like case-bycase basis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. something committee do.
 
 9/29/98
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Right. background, might constructive us
 discussion point would explicitly address tradeoff
 balance need intervene crisis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Larry Meyer's committee, presume.
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, could that, would give us sense
 group view tradeoff. think would helpful.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. one respect Fed bank supervisor;
 another Fed central bank degree responsibility financial stability.
 think implies broader discussion.
 MR. BROADDUS. latter context mind.
 MR. MEYER. committee certainly engaging broader dialogue
 think this.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. sounds exhausted
