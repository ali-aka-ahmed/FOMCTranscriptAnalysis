 first came result Chairman's speech, market effect

 continues outpace growth region's labor force, pushing unemployment rates

 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. past year, performance
 Sixth District economy generally paralleled nation,

 important differences concerns begun note.
 First, Asian situation marginal impact District far.
 Shipments Asia moderated, especially shipments fertilizer, pulp, paper,
 citrus. large chemical company region experienced cancellations
 shipments Asia reportedly relieved unable meet
 
 2/3-4/98

 overall effects Asia minimal far, declines region's exports
 Asia mitigated stable growth exports Latin America.
 Second, recent decline, prices oil natural gas
 approaching historic break-even levels past would caused domestic
 drilling extraction begin shut down. However, see evidence
 pattern time around, fact rig count remains high levels. new
 drilling technologies talked past meetings truly brought break-even
 prices much lower levels. Hence, don't expect see slowing sector
 would past cycles.
 Third, real estate activity, especially residential, mixed region
 appears case nationwide. Commercial construction strong, especially
 grocery class office space, balance weakness seeing
 residential construction. One cautionary note, however, starting get
 
 2/3-4/98
 
 numerous expressions concern pockets excessively speculative commercial
 construction emerging, notably north Atlanta market.
 Fourth, getting mixed signals lenders. Consistent loan
 officers' survey, credit still seems available competition fierce. lenders
 asked whether credit standards slipping, response generally no, lenders
 go say competition apt grant loans lower rates

 credit standards pricing risk something concerned about.
 Fifth, respect wages prices, like everyone else continue get
 reports labor shortages, firms either going great lengths hire qualified
 workers curtailing production. example, shipbuilders New Orleans
 resorting hiring workers overseas fill need welders, shipfitters,
 workers. One national trucking executive reported idling 10 percent
 equipment able find qualified drivers. Despite problems,
 however, wage increases region appear held moderate levels,
 also appears case prices. recent manufacturing survey,
 portion firms reporting paying higher prices materials decreased,
 proportion firms indicating received higher prices finished goods.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. turn discussion long-run

 MR. LINDSEY. Committee given colorful charts yesterday,

 0.3 percentage point each. Thus, revisions place M2 growth somewhat
 5 percent upper bound range last year M3 growth even
 6 percent upper bound.
 second column shows staff forecasts money, credit, nominal GDP
 year. Nominal GDP M2 expected grow annual rates 3-1/2
 percent, represents quite slowdown measures. Committee's
 central tendency nominal GDP midpoint bit 4 percent,
 implying somewhat faster rate M2 growth staff foresees year,
 assuming flat V2. lower panel next chart, also revised

 institution-only money fund component M3 attractive cash management
 tool. important, depository institutions need appreciable M3-type
 funding finance lending maintain share relatively rapid
 debt growth.
 projection growth debt domestic nonfinancial sectors,
 5-1/4 percent, also exceed nominal GDP sizable margin. Hence,
 projected debt velocity, shown lower panel chart, falls year
 almost 2 percent pace. may seen panel, apart exceptional
 drop debt velocity 1980s, ratio evinced little trend since
 early 1960s. fall debt velocity year mostly reflects larger business
 borrowing necessitated flagging corporate earnings greater merger-related
 retirements equity.
 Turning back table, three alternative sets ranges presented
 Committee consideration. Alternative retains provisional specifications
 Committee chose last July. recent years, FOMC interpreted
 ranges broad money suggestive expectations growth year
 two covered ranges. Instead, continued heightened
 uncertainty demand broad money, Committee interpreted
 ranges consistent trend money growth conditions

 around 3 percent year; increase composed measured potential real

 FOMC interpreted 3 7 percent debt range alternative
 differently ranges monetary aggregates. Committee
 intended debt range encompass likely growth debt year

 fairly close 5 percent midpoint range. 5 percent midpoint,
 however, would high characterize expectation trend debt growth

 rationale unchanged meeting, may wish consider alternative II.
 alternative encompasses expected growth year three aggregates.
 Thus, makes rationale M3 like familiar one debt

 raising M3 range even more, say 4 8 percent, would come even closer

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? would like start
 Committee discussion? Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Whenever talk monetary aggregate ranges, seems
 always caught two kinds decisions: whether want confirm
 change interpretation give ranges boundaries want set.
 staff presentation today reminds us ranges set inconsistently terms
 interpretation, opportunity make consistent. M2
 M3 set according call "price stability" rationale, one consistent
 price stability normal velocity behavior, debt set according call
 "projections" interpretation.
 seems principle consistency value here. think
 ranges set consistently one another. could argue whether
 "price stability" "projections" interpretation one want use. view,
 choice two involves two principles. One call convenience. long
 lot uncertainty projected potential instability aggregates,
 
 2/3-4/98
 
 "price stability" interpretation rather convenient. principle consistency
 Humphrey-Hawkins, spirit Humphrey-Hawkins, would make
 lean toward "projections" interpretation.
 midst concern instability monetary aggregates,
 comfortable "price stability" rationale stability emerges long enough us
 move back "projections" interpretation. Given that, prefer spirit alternative
 III. particular, cannot think good rationale alternative II
 change aggregate inconsistent two. Now, like alternative
 IIIin principle, think timing moving alternative particularly
 good. one hand, would lowering target range debt raising
 forecast growth. other, would drawing attention monetary
 aggregates time necessarily want signal going place
 emphasis them. So, would prefer retain alternative I, growth rate
 projections debt aggregate decline time become consistent
 "price stability" rationale--if occur--we could lower debt range
 change interpretation, too.
 One observation would bring relates ranges M2
 aggregate. staff made good point M2 range seems almost
 perfectly centered virtual price stability. implies 1/2 percent increase inflation.
 So, might said that, voting alternative I, saying price stability
 indeed long-run inflation target intend achieve. want come
 back issue policy position statement, want preference
 alternative necessarily carry implication.
 
 2/3-4/98
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. ranges, think main thing need
 leave M2 range today 1 5 percent. would serve signal
 continuing commitment price stability operationally likely rate M2
 growth would consistent maintaining low inflation environment
 enjoying. three alternatives 1 5 percent range M2, relatively
 indifferent among them. regard, worth noting, Dave Lindsey indicated,
 evidence standard M2 demand equation coming back track.
 So, least case made giving M2 little weight. recognize
 uncertainties involved, believe little weight M2 would
 desirable deliberations going forward. context, seems worth noting
 fact M2 coming back track little velocity trend, annual rate M2
 growth close 7 percent seen recently clearly inconsistent
 maintaining progress made reducing inflation.
 Humphrey-Hawkins meeting July last year, made usual plea, Mr.
 Chairman, consider setting, one way another, explicit least somewhat
 concrete precise longer-term inflation objective. couple recent
 developments make want put issue back table try
 briefly. First, close price stability right now--candidly, lot closer
 thought last year maybe year half ago would time.
 measured CPI currently around 2 percent upward bias around 1 percent,
 true underlying rate inflation may 1 percent perhaps little higher.
 couple implications see it. One longer need get hung
 
 2/3-4/98
 
 topic transition costs moving back price stability. already
 essentially. think powerful argument trying lock price stability
 announcing somewhat specific inflation objective. Also, inflation low
 currently, public become aware concerned deflation.
 obvious understandable reasons, much public comment
 deflation recently past. effect, one might say recently gone
 mini-deflation scare. current low inflation environment, seems
 longer-term policy strategy needs address deflation concerns well
 inflation concerns.
 reason, believe consider stating explicitly lower bound
 longer-term inflation objective. could zero accurate price index maybe
 1 percent actual measured CPI. would explain would avoid
 going lower bound. that, think would help clarify strategy
 situations begun receive attention recently that,
 understandably, previously received lot attention four five decades.
 view, could help us avoid getting kind situation Japanese
 found time time recent years. course, announce
 lower bound inflation, would make sense us announce simultaneously
 explicit upper bound well. might neighborhood 3 percent
 measured CPI. Even economists think inflation desirable one reason
 another generally agree inflation 3 percent excessive. event,
 set lower bound, believe would set upper bound
 
 2/3-4/98
 
 not, would invite credibility problems. one reason giving strong
 consideration upper inflation limit today.
 briefly, consideration believe strengthens case
 concrete inflation objective, broadens incidentally include Congressional
 mandate price stability, recent fiscal developments. know
 major fiscal challenges still facing nation long run. now, strikes
 members Congress sides aisle proud
 achievement balancing budget, whatever true underlying economic forces
 producing balance may be. feel accomplished longer-term
 strategic economic objective, equivalent price stability objective. So,
 stars may right place change, little push might possible
 persuade Congress give us longer-term guiding principles monetary policy.
 would urge you, Mr. Chairman, consider making pitch upcoming testimony
 Congressional mandate, past.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, basically agree points made Governor
 Meyer would favor alternative I. seems reasons changing
 ranges cited past, Governor Meyer mentioned,
 applicable today. Eventually, make sense go shown
 alternative III, view fact debt projected increase faster rate

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.

 although moving consistent set ranges would rather nice.
 druthers would consistent talking Ms all.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. favor alternative zero?

 alternative I.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.

 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you. Don, intrigued final comment

 MR. KOHN. I'm aware asymmetry modeling exercises,
 think asymmetry normal course raising lowering rates. One point
 tried convey Committee begin think relates situations
 inflation nominal interest rates low levels, though
 certainly there. nominal funds rate 5-1/2 percent right now. one
 
 2/3-4/98
 imagine economy running along 1 percent inflation rate 2 3 percent
 nominal funds rate. economy gets hit shock, policymakers

 asymmetries perspective. limit high
 nominal rate go, downside limit zero. potential asymmetry
 regard zero level nominal wages others talked about. inflation
 low started go low levels, might adverse
 tradeoffs inflation Phillips curve basis people reluctant reduce
 nominal wages. seen evidence that, something people
 concerned past. So, one thing discussed now,
 perhaps relevant Governor Meyer saying before, inflation
 low potentially getting low, particularly falls short current forecasts,
 affects think monetary policy. President McTeer's rule thumb
 yesterday subtract percentage point staff's inflation projection.
 MS. MINEHAN. cannot that!
 MR. KOHN. low rate inflation might least mind

 MR. KOHN. low rate inflation.
 
 2/3-4/98
 MS. MINEHAN. Right. Then, given are, really say

 MR. KOHN. Ideally, course, want good foresight act

 MR. PRELL. May inject thought? want deny argument

 provided past, example, regard Akerlof-Dickens-Perry notion

 MR. GUYNN. Don, say GDP path associated

 MR. KOHN. see looking two lines showing rate

 Productivity gains fourth quarter slowed outsized, frankly
 nonbelievable, gains third quarter. might say parenthetically staff
 estimating nonfinancial corporate productivity growth 2.1 percent annual rate
 fourth quarter cumulative growth 1997 3.2 percent fourth-quarter
 fourth-quarter basis; full percentage point higher previous four
 quarters 1996.
 Productivity gains clearly kept increases unit labor costs modest
 level; indeed, latter shown signs accelerating last several
 quarters. increases costs four quarters ended 1997 estimated
 slightly 1 percent 1 percent previous year. Similarly, unit nonlabor
 costs continued decline overall unit costs practical purposes within
 shouting range zero way last 12 18 months. profit
 margins opening up, modest increase prices--something area

 So, growth cost structure effectively zero. Indeed, price increase is,

 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation "B"

 however, tell risks clarified, may
 act quite forcefully. fact acting may sense increasing
 burden us act forcefully future figure risks are,
 may soon new numbers come out.
 last comment relates Governor Meyer's suggestion debate
 price stability targets. think always good idea debates,
 believe going hard productive debate. One reason, previous
 discussion indicated, probably slightly different notions
 mean price stability. certainly different operational notions
 whether look index index, adjusted way way,
 relative prices absolute prices. probably always desirable go
