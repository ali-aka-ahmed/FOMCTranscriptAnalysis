 MR. BROADDUS. question, Mr. Chairman, first would like echo

 time, along Ed Boehne, thought one particularly well done, especially
 focus international context.
 question inventories. seen fair amount commentary

 normal, involved imported goods. looking reference Greenbook,

 small impact behavior final demand United States going forward.
 anything that?
 MR. PRELL. know, direct observations this. One significant
 element rapid accumulation inventories first quarter oil. Clearly, greater
 flexibility supply short run import side opposed domestic
 production. So, buildup oil stocks unwinds, would expect impact
 import side. Actually, seen accumulation second quarter best
 tell. buildup gotten point much room storing
 oil. probably stored ships distant places oceans. expect
 continuing accumulation oil inventories end near term.
 Outside oil sector, look normal ratios imports various categories

 inventory pickup first quarter probably imports. anecdotes
 effect stock building occurred take advantage bargains available
 either components finished goods. So, yes, think complex interaction
 involved--just something imported doesn't mean offset imports

 contemplates terms overall import growth domestic spending patterns.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. get calculation supports Mike Prell

 increase oil inventories first quarter imports, considering limited capacity

 MR. POOLE. would like make three comments. first plea

 minus net imports equals output; arithmetic. say net imports drag
 output making assumption causation think there.
 MR. PRELL. think crossed Rubicon this. recognize hard
 express thought, come conclusion everyone understands area.
 MR. POOLE. I'm sure that, think easy express
 different way. simply say total spending exceeds total output net exports
 negative. think easy slip wrong frame mind this. plea
 accurate terminology here.
 Secondly, looked oil price futures newspaper morning, August
 year August next year, saw Brent oil futures going $14 $17 per barrel. think
 substantially larger increase have, might want comment
 view differs futures market.
 Thirdly, important comment, seems internal
 structure forecast makes perfect sense growth final sales slows. components
 forecast would internally consistent. still understand drive slow

 MR. PRELL. Peter Hooper say something response question oil

 MR. HOOPER. address oil price question, think jump futures

 production much agreement suggests. upside risk oil price
 forecast light recent events.
 MR. PRELL. think one ask, too, whether current prices

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since fine report
 Tenth District earlier, keep comments relatively brief. [Laughter] say, though,
 District economy remains strong. directors business contacts report signs

 pork prices running 25 percent levels year ago. Corn prices
 12 percent. Part problem stems drop demand Asia. Wheat
 exports Asia especially weak, contributing low hog cattle prices

 crop inventories build second straight year. low prices persist futures

 Lower farm incomes will, believe, lead rise farm loan problems year.
 However, banks strong portfolios coming year able absorb
 likely increases delinquencies. Moreover, rising farmland values strong cash rents
 continue indicate many farmers still strong balance sheets. positive note,
 course, weak farm prices moderate upward pressures food prices.
 national front, think private domestic demand fundamentally strong. Even
 though domestic demand growth may slow forecast horizon, believe remain
 even long-run trend. first-quarter revision suggests economy carried
 
 6/30-7/1/98

 support view. Even though expansion slow year due expected
 inventory correction worsening trade deficit, think slowing keep real
 GDP growing long-run trend. recognize inventories decline net
 exports significant risk expansion.
 Recent developments inflation front caused revise upward
 inflation expectations year. increase core inflation seen far year

 worry little inflationary consequences.
 Finally, continued strong growth monetary aggregates, M2 M3, suggests
 monetary conditions become accommodative. said this,
 aware favorable offsetting factors continue exert moderating influences. Pipeline
 pressures small; capacity utilization declining; dollar, course,
 appreciating. addition, historically high real federal funds rate appears
 consistent slower expansion.
 weigh balance follows: expansion recently shown signs

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. one level might seem

 subtle differences policy question since expansion proceeded. Beginning
 domestic economy, first quarter unsustainably rapid almost anyone's definition.
 inventory swing, damping influence stock market, net exports,
 guess I'm agreement Greenbook growth slowing roughly
 sustainable path. One could argue policy tighten help process along,
 suppose comfortable view policy sit still let slowdown

 Turning international economy, others said repeat it:

 Adding up, still roughly comfortable present policy. Given

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think I'm last speak,
 try brief. received number signals intermeeting period. Many
 indicators point continued uptrend economy, perhaps slower pace
 necessarily one without inflation risks.
 others said, jobs continue plentiful. labor market tight. April's
 4.3 percent unemployment rate fluke. Indeed, year May,
 unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent, probably anyone's reasonable
 estimate NAIRU. Disturbingly, labor markets clearly creating conditions
 wage-induced inflation view noticeably stronger earlier. Average hourly
 earnings increased 4.3 percent past 12 months, 3.9 percent prior 12
 months turn 3.3 percent 12 months that. addition, so-called
 indicators worker insecurity appear turned toward increasing security. President
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 Broaddus talked son. median duration unemployment normally two
 weeks five weeks eight weeks previously. quit rate back
 labor force participation grown further.
 recognize productivity increases may offset nominal wage increases,
 regard hopeful staff right fact think probably are.
 However, difference nominal wage gains productivity growth, even assuming
 uptick productivity trend, growing ever larger. view, gap wage
 gains productivity growth putting increasing pressure businesses translate
 wage gains price increases, particularly growth profit margins slowing.
 Someone mentioned earlier yield curve flattening. see it,
 flattening driven long end short end, suggest
 slowing economy. fact, might stimulative effect. So, believe
 cautious putting much weight flattening. Finally, others said,
 strength labor markets feeding unabated demand consumer goods, interestsensitive goods, housing particular, continued display strength.
 Others talked Greenbook forecast, quickly give read
 it, dramatically different others. staff suggests extremely
 strong economic picture going cooled lower growth rates net exports, correction
 inventory overhang, moderation PCE uptrend. think best
 barest evidence support deceleration story.
 net export story, Greenbook indicates, actually past prologue.
 staff forecast says worst direct retarding impact net exports already
 occurred first quarter going forward likely see less direct impact
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 sector economy. Therefore, relying multiplier-accelerator story
 achieve desired results, think Mike Prell suggested response President Poole's
 question.
 Similarly, respect slowdown inventory accumulation, think I'm
 camp President Minehan. Inventory-to-shipment ratios manufacturing edged
 slightly, remain January. Wholesale inventory-to-sales
 ratios also seem quite well behaved. Admittedly, maintaining ratios require
 continued $100 billion annual rate inventory increase, seem likely may
 increase less slowdown staff expects.
 Finally, staff looking forward slowdown PCE due slowing
 wealth creation stock market slight uptick unemployment. rise

 believe us would regard indication loose labor market. slowdown
 stock market may turn out, usual, ephemeral real. So, see real risks

 are, others indicated, countervailing potentially growing risks
 downside. strike GM, think, likely exert short-term noticeable shock.
 international developments others talked certainly less certain.
 one thing could add, coming back Japan talking private-sector
 forecasters there, believe base forecast staff presented us somewhat
 optimistic forecasters Japan currently believe. So,
 downside potential there.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 summary, believe risks upside still exist. However, none
 worries yet realities. staff forecast may materialize and, like others, hope does.
 think risks downside little stronger time last
 meeting. obviously continued international instability. balance, would go
 word "uncertain" characterizing outlook. future quite uncertain think
 action required part, either down. prudent course is, again, wait

 times. Again, terms simulations models, think it's quite
 interesting result. frankly find alternative policy options interesting,
 particular "put" option bring long-term interest rates down; perhaps
 practical relevance real world situations.
 want make couple additional points, may related Bill
 Poole brought up. seems deflation zero interest rates somewhat similar
 effect break history sense estimated Keynesian model period
 history really basic condition. So, may strange
 results particularly satisfying, often would case break
 history.
 also conceivable, although basically buy Keynesian approach, may
 regime shifts different points. hyperinflation may different regime
 would zero inflation. Although know looked different models,
 seem involve complete regime shifts.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning. We'll begin discussion
 longer-run objectives money debt growth. call Bill Whitesell start us off.
 MR. WHITESELL. Committee must decide whether
 make adjustments ranges money debt growth,
 unchanged since mid-1995. recent years, Committee
 interpreting monetary ranges would consistent price

 opportunity costs held constant across four subperiods value

 allowing level shift early 1990s, M2 velocity

 Chart 5 plots percentage deviations V2 predicted opportunity

 even M2 velocity predictable prior

 monetary aggregate would providing appropriate signal policy.
 However, M2 may times diverge range

 Despite uncertainty money demand, M2 still seems

 higher money growth similar amounts, things equal. However,
 couple noted yesterday assumed higher funds rate

 funds rate 3/4percentage point higher end year would mean
 nearly percentage point weaker M2 growth 1999, combined
 effects stronger nominal GDP higher funds rate could
 roughly wash.

 latter would imply upward adjustment current ranges.
 Alternatively, ranges based annual projections money debt
 could help inform public expected annual growth
 aggregates, could useful, particularly sense
 growth rates would begin raise concerns you. Rapid money
 growth relative ranges might one factor could cite
 explaining policy tightening, particularly preemptive nature.
 projection-based ranges would also closer spirit

 linked greater emphasis monetary debt aggregates

 forecast ranges policy targets perhaps go even

 projection-based ranges. hand, retaining price stability ranges
 monetary aggregates preclude giving
 attention policymaking.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions? questions! guess created

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, agree comments ranges. I, too,
 would want choose ranges basis projection consistent forecast.
 would prefer set basis consistent price stability. would suggest,
 though, approach might strongly support choice alternative III
 ranges alternative, including 1 5 percent range debt, intended
 consistent price stability. turns out, projection debt suggests might

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. somewhat sympathetic President
 Parry's view, think dog better left barking night bringing
 attention ranges time. would lot explaining said
 reducing debt range move even direction price stability. I'm sure
 opening argument would convincing worth trouble. move would
 occur time us concerned that, look purely domestic economy,
 likelihood monetary policy might tightened. think giving signal
 clearly would interpreted weakening monetary policy would terrible idea.
 Although sympathize President Parry's view, believe better retain
 present ranges aggregates.
 MR. PARRY. I'm sure understand mean "weakening monetary
 policy."
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. words, would change debt
 range even though think probably correct intellectually.
 MR. PARRY. reducing range, opposite weakening.
 MS. MINEHAN. meant weakening debt growth.
 MR. PARRY. Oh, see.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think make changes
 would increase monetary ranges, therefore fine-tuning debt range--which
 really suggesting, not?
 MR. PARRY. Yes, debt range. change ranges.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think would bring attention subject
 need.
 MR. PARRY. see.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Let offer alternative perspective. think current price
 stability interpretation allows target ranges money growth set independently
 current forecast projected policy therefore ignored policy process.
 Switching projections interpretation therefore closely connected view return
 money growth important role setting monetary policy. expanded role,
 noted Bluebook, need form rigid target policy responding
 aggressively deviations M2 growth target. expanded role would least
 signal money growth would important indicator variable, deviations
 money growth target range would one number considerations would
 affect course monetary policy.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 look forward return projections interpretation money growth ranges
 two reasons. First, believe consistent spirit Humphrey-Hawkins
 Act. Second, believe would increase public awareness money growth, could
 useful times explaining need change policy. particular, might make
 easier explain need tightening monetary policy period robust
 economic growth pushes money growth target range.
 staff reports V2 continues perform well relative determinants
 case deterioration performance early 1990s. progress
 report similar made virtually every meeting discussed topic
 two years Committee. So, question when? additional
 hurdles expect M2 jump long period accord new
 role? fact, bar seems raised.
 second question put discussion Bluebook meeting.
 velocity ever stable predictable enough justify important role? This, course,
 relevant question. assessment money growth play useful role earlier
 may, therefore, ready resume somewhat important role going forward. greater
 role money growth policy process might facilitated returning
 projections interpretation range identification long-run target money
 growth consistent Committee's inflation target. implicitly identify target
 today midpoint current money growth ranges, interpreted
 consistent price stability. Many countries either adopted explicit inflation target
 given central role money growth policy deliberations, insuring nominal
 anchor monetary policy communication.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 decide adopt explicit inflation target, according money growth
 important role policy process establishing long-run target money growth would
 natural alternative. considering long-run target money growth rate indeed
 specifying numerical range price stability interpretation, think also need
 take account analysis implications zero nominal interest rate bound
 discussed yesterday. current price stability interpretation money growth ranges set
 midpoint M2 growth 3 percent, corresponding a1/2 percent inflation rate
 GDP price index. decide appropriate long-run inflation target true
 inflation plus cushion, long-run money growth target M2 raised.
 alternatives I, II, III? Alternative III remains unattractive despite
 consistency. doesn't make sense move alternative III ultimate objective,
 case, move price stability projections interpretation ranges.
 personally ready move projections interpretation ranges, though case
 numerical ranges alternative II adjusted make consistent FOMC
 consensus forecast. staff, however, necessary information make
 adjustment need FOMC's projections short-term interest rates well
 nominal income.
 Let suggest possibilities. First, might appropriate Chairman
 note upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins testimony Committee moving toward
 paying somewhat closer attention money growth, agreement
 case. Second, perhaps could ask staff adjust alternative II ranges make
 consistent Committee's forecast think
 accomplish this. Third, perhaps retain alternative ranges meeting keep
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 track adjusted alternative II ranges see useful relative forthcoming
 developments M2 think policy choices months ahead.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. come issue position opposite Governor
 Meyer's closer yours, Mr. Chairman. think value aggregates terms
 communications focuses long term rather short run. went back look
 original language Humphrey-Hawkins legislation, concluded focus
 language communicating ranges Committee plans various aggregates. Since
 enactment legislation, Committee explaining difficult plan
 aggregates affected numerous variables. seems
 short periods time, like half year 1998 full year 1999, better
 focusing longer-term goals rather trying project establish plans variables
 subject enormous amount change, evidenced factors talked
 earlier. think communications value aggregates better focus
 longer-run objectives.
 also think keeping ranges are, lose value M2
 deliberations. point made earlier widely recognized monetary
 targets intermediate variables. array variables look
 determine going on. may able look confidence
 relationships seem stabilized little. good thing. mean
 change ranges looking somewhat
 seriousness perhaps using greater extent before.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 think communications value exactly way put it. could go
 either alternative alternative III. inclination stay are.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. reading ranges recent years almost
 completely ignored public primarily financial markets realize money
 growth play essential role Committee's deliberations course policy.
 perception became member Committee. think ranges
 serve useful function conveying attitude policy inflation long run.
 would leave completely Chairman believes effectively use
 opportunity convey Committee's views. certainly share view move
 alternative II would unfortunate think would read context
 relaxation concern inflation. question whether alternative
 alternative III III-A something else along lines, would leave completely
 Chairman's discretion choose whatever thinks could use effectively conveying

 I, course, sympathy Larry Meyer's statement aggregates
 play important role policymaking. certainly view. think
 Committee get first terms actual use aggregates making
 policy announce world doing. So, although lot
 sympathy approach policy, don't think would good idea make
 announcement carry it.

 think make change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. sympathetic position laid initially, Mr.
 Chairman, intellectual case changing debt range, think
 worth effort point. therefore would keeping ranges are.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. year ago meeting, felt 1 5
 percent right M2 range 1998, given economy operating people's notion
 full employment, still think that. year ago, thought money growth coming
 1 5 percent range, repeating experience late 1996, adjusting
 level funds rate, still think that. thought year ago money growth
 coming staff projections late 1997 first half 1998, would telling
 us nominal income growth exceeding GDP forecast, error
 GDP forecast. still think that. So, still think 1 5 percent M2 range right,
 right, tells us policy appropriately calibrated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, favor called price
 stability approach ranges, alternative certainly fine me. seems
 abstract level, potential problem going something like alternative II.
 is, allow normal lags money nominal GDP money inflation,
 might inadvertently set situation would prepared tolerate
 accommodate perhaps even produce inflation wanted future
 consequence raising ranges. So, abstract level, would comfortable
 that.
 practical level, raise ranges, might seen acceptable
 unusual situation would explain inflation low. certainly
 perception public views inflation low. say inflation low
 therefore going raise money ranges intuitively make sense me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. unintuitively does? [Laughter]
 MR. MEYER. Could point Committee accepting view
 policy decisions. saying don't want communicate Congress
 look disciplined enough?
 MR. STERN. I'm sorry, didn't follow.
 MR. MEYER. price stability range range aiming next year.
 MS. MINEHAN. Maybe are!
 MR. STERN. guess part view this, Larry, don't think
 ability precise forecasting M2 variables.
 precise. troubled two facts. One fact trouble next year's
 projection 4 percent M2 growth right center range. would
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 astonished M2 wound growing 3 percent next year, say, opposed 4 percent. also
 trouble explaining ranges Congress recent years. I'm even
 sure issue come recent years, certainly haven't problem
 come explaining money growth deviated ranges. Congress seems
 fully satisfied explanations, least best read situation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, agree let sleeping dogs lie far
 ranges concerned. would disturb them. long believed, though,
 keep monetary aggregates alive possible future use. look Chart 4,
 especially southeast corner shows relationship opportunity cost V2
 recent years, somewhat surprised close relationship been. lived
 years don't recall aware behaving well. wonder may
 result revisions money numbers something like that. agree President
 Poole said use aggregates policy tell public
 using way. relationship stays close appears graph,
 think (1) paying attention aggregates policy (2)
 occasionally refer publicly come time best way
 explain terms growth aggregates. don't always
 want say think interest rates higher.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. every presentation monetary policy
 made Congress, reference money supply exactly reason,
 keep aggregates alive. want shift back emphasis aggregates

 MR. MCTEER. read financial press, though, get impression
 nobody thinks looking M2. reporting terms things. So,
 think aggregates broken consciousness financial writers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would join argue
 making changes current ranges. Presidents Minehan Poole made
 arguments way probably would made them. repeat one arguments,
 see anything current construct takes away ability
 give whatever weight wish give aggregates selected ranges. fact,
 would argue money growth trending consider price
 stability ranges keeps issue front us greater extent would adjusting ranges fit
 experience. So, strongly prefer retaining current monetary growth ranges, would
 tinker current time range debt. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree President Guynn. think
 important us keep track ranges consistent views long-term
 price stability. allow us focused remind rest us
 experiencing trend growth. think actually provides useful discipline.
 also took note, President McTeer, southeast corner Chart 4 indicates
 stability may returning relationships. me, provides little hope
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 might increased discipline ranges therefore reason keep
 alive. So, would change right now. would keep monetary growth ranges
 focused long-run price stability, look forward day might start use
 seriously deliberations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, I, too, believe price stability approach setting
 long-run ranges. view, continues long-term relationship money
 growth inflation, think returning use money aggregates
 distant future. Therefore, would support either alternative alternative III.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, also would make change ranges
 either two time periods. case second half 1998, agree President
 Minehan Humphrey-Hawkins Act primarily focuses Committee plans
 aggregates. implies setting benchmark. change ranges
 middle year would destroy value benchmark fuzz reasons
 adopted. case making change year ahead six months advance,
 reason might Committee wanted signal major change
 ahead. may--I emphasize may--have candidate change want
 send signal aggregates much front burner been.
 would say signal desired, might better approached developing
 kind information release Committee debate perhaps adopt it, rather
 simply changing ranges meeting. think change point could prove
 counterproductive.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. I, too, concur keeping ranges are. fact
 look money supply numbers discuss along lot variables,
 time Committee really used set policy. would need lot
 convincing believe should. leaves me, course, sympathy
 Meyer projections approach, come thinking leaving well enough alone best
 policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also opposed changing
 ranges interpreting ranges goals. would retain alternative I, would point
 stochastic goals involve relationships.
 tremendously influenced bottom panel Chart 4, relationships come go. would
 like put plug ever change ranges, think put table
 notion tried last time widening them. now, I'm happy stick alternative I.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, strongly agree position. main
 focus M2 rather M3 debt aggregate. Like others, think current 1 5
 percent range M2 plays couple critical roles. First, strongly view
 clearly signals ongoing commitment price stability. fact, one might argue
 range formal nominal anchor have. think also provides early warning
 system actual money growth begins deviate upside recently. helps
 signal that. So, sense holds feet fire. think Bob Parry point. certainly
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 would object going alternative III, guess disadvantages making change
 questions might raise probably would lead continue prefer alternative I.
 One point would make context possibility may want
 use aggregates operational way going forward. Bluebook
 alternative shows would get back 1 5 percent M2
 range end year, might make sense starting point something
 like list alternatives.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. appears fairly general consensus
 change, alternative I. Would read language encompassing alternative?
 MR. BERNARD. page 22 Bluebook. first sentence

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. essentially
 agreement analysis conclusion. modest differences. believe
 risk external side somewhat greater indicated, could materialize
 even sooner anticipated. basis know, Liberal
 Democratic Party going announce Japan July 2, coming us rather quickly,
 disappointing financial markets. big rally yen
 Nikkei mainly end-of-quarter rally June 30. Today, Nikkei rally
 resumed, think markets indicated expecting far announcement
 July 2 likely there. Therefore, notion, think single biggest
 problem, Japanese government leading party cannot get act together could
 us rather quickly indeed.
 agree Russian situation extremely hazardous. Since one areas
 strength world economy continental Europe, serious financial crisis Russia,
 could quickly turn political crisis nation lots weapons, could easily undo
 confidence restored continental Europe last year. think
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 severe worsening international situation certainly within range probable,
 would describe risk distinctly possible.
 domestic side economy, agree much view, Mr.
 Chairman, know whether wonderful productivity improvement
 experiencing going last. laid basis uncertainty well
 remarks. think likelihood wage pressures going burst terribly great.
 would happen view various pockets economy people would start
 realize could push employers pay higher wages, think realization
 probably would spread somewhat slowly remarks suggested. Therefore,
 price reaction might somewhat slower well. However, clearly domestic economy
 looked isolation one assumes international crisis happen,
 certainly hope not, think situation risks inflation
 sufficiently great that, although agree change policy today,
 asymmetric directive toward tightening certainly order.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree recommendation
 maintaining federal funds rate today also maintaining bias toward
 tightening. concerned prospects updrift inflation. guess fear, perhaps
 do, staff's forecast slower expansion without policy intervention
 may optimistic. recognize indications little slowing right
 now, I'm afraid may short-lived. also think, based information
 received staff, even updrift productivity, may call higher
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 funds rate lower funds rate order maintain equilibrium. So, optimistic
 scores, think bias toward tightening recommend right.
 However, line Vice Chair said, also concerned
 international component forecast mentioned yesterday. think external situation
 going improve anytime soon. Therefore, believe wiser course us stage
 sit tight. guess ultimately least unacceptable choice, think also
 responsible one. Therefore, would make change either funds rate asymmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously, delighted staffs
 upward revisions estimates productivity growth potential output growth,
 even pleased future revisions also upward 3, 3-1/4, even 3-1/2 percent,
 guess highest history. would absolutely delightful. doubt see
 go set new record, happens, would great! Nevertheless,
 productivity growth still rapid growth demand, creates problem
 have. also delighted unemployment rate 4.3 percent, hope
 continues go down. would like see go 4 percent even 4 percent. Low
 unemployment helps us wonderful things providing opportunities people. also
 sets model rest world works. longer sustain it,
 imitators around world going have. So, hope get
 situation take action. unavoidable byproduct would higher
 unemployment rate. would bad us, also bad model rest
 world found faced take action.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 look Asian situation, perhaps Latin America, certainly Russia,
 think ease policy. Unfortunately, luxury even considering
 option time, bad. Maybe nominal spending growth, money growth,
 things last year forecast staff instead coming stronger,
 economy might balanced right might able entertain possibility.
 maybe responded earlier indications spending growth, domestic demand,
 money credit growth coming lot stronger current account deficit
 widening, might option considering easing sooner. think going
 need ease sake rest world. sooner create conditions within
 domestic economy permit us contemplate easing policy, better
 going better world going be. Unfortunately, sometimes
 tack; sometimes go opposite direction really want go get
 there.
 
 want world lower inflation, lower

 know enough whether would constructive make change point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, clearly seeing weakness
 second-quarter numbers, seems even though growth final demand
 may weaker second quarter thought going weeks ago,
 still going well trend. discussed two negative impulses
 inventories net exports, said yesterday, feeling likely
 temporary. good chance much lasting effect
 trend growth final demand. growth upside risk, think take
 seriously environment labor costs core CPI consistently measured
 basis rising.
 still think increase funds rate would prudent could well
 increase lifespan expansion. said that, recognize many reasons
 expressed around table, would convenient time tighten policy
 since likely get weaker-than-expected GDP number end month
 public perception might link whatever action might take meeting number,
 would cause unfortunate problems us.
 sort constraint underlies need take advantage opportunities tighten
 policy arise environment like this. arise often, window
 opportunity often stay open long. know people disagree this,
 frankly think may missed couple opportunities recent past might
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 served us well. So, see strength overall demand persisting go forward,
 perhaps result improvement Asian situation, see window
 opportunity, believe take it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, question view currently
 face heightened risks. downside, risks discussed lengthy review
 economic outlook yesterday morning stem developments Asia, Russia,
 places, projections declining inventory investment short term, possible impact
 reduced profit margins stock market. downside risks seem
 compelling time May meeting, scary cases. think
 remember, however, given persisting strength expansion, need
 retarding influences rein growth domestic economy. forecasted
 slowdown, seeing slowdown. may little larger expected, think
 worry overreacting current circumstances.
 believe risks upside also increased. beginning see warning
 signs rising inflation. continue atmosphere accommodating financial
 markets. recognize temporary factors work still helping restrain
 costs, temporary influences may fade away. continue believe, much like
 President Broaddus, run significant risk excess demand whose cumulative effects
 may well come back bite us end, may missed couple chances
 tighten policy taken advantage earlier.
 also agree Vice Chairman timing policy
 tightening move favorable today, especially Japanese trying work
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 appropriate policies seem many potential developments hanging
 balance. So, would agree proposal, sense reluctantly think
 policy may well behind curve far domestic economy concerned. would
 hope can, President Broaddus suggested, find window opportunity
 little tightening might helpful us rest world. regard, would
 retain tilt toward tightening well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, upside downside risks face much
 talked last meeting, number us said,
 seem severe directions. domestic economy continued show signs
 unsustainable growth, seen modest worsening inflation readings.
 However, international situation grown even uncertain since last meeting,
 saw firsthand recent trip Japan. think chances severe
 anticipated reduction net exports appear increased.
 would add experience dealing Japanese government
 LDP lead believe act quickly decisively deal problems.
 unique culture political processes powerful, likely change
 short term. believe long haul.
 now, think uncertainties international outlook clearly justify waiting.
 However, think that, balance, risks remain definitely upside
 likely tighten year. So, agree recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, many reasons mentioned, agree
 recommendation regard federal funds rate asymmetry.
 seem me, however, inflation becoming serious problem. greatest fear
 may losing relatively painless gains inflation enjoyed last year
 so. loss would tragic. still agree, though, recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. comments others

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. Certainly nothing ever going perfectly clear! support
 recommendation, Mr. Chairman. said yesterday, think staff may overestimating

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. light sharp slowdown U.S.
 economic growth appears taken place second quarter, increased potential
 persistent slowdown due deterioration foreign economic activity
 perhaps especially due substantial increase global risk, support recommendation
 change policy today. Nevertheless, remain quite concerned risk inflation
 going forward due tight labor markets prevailing today, due continued robust
 state domestic demand, due uncertainty degree persistence
 slowdown. Therefore, strongly favor asymmetric directive well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. upside risk appears risen further, probably
 last several meetings, downside risk seems gone quite sharply
 since last meeting point think risks, even though greater
 were, relatively balanced. guess willing minority one that,
 favor change policy today, would suggest removal bias toward tightening.
 Obviously, Asia spreading financial crisis around world main reason.
 view, reason much possible spillover effects United States
 trade accounts whatever. don't know spillover likely be. think that,
 balance, positive far. world's remaining superpower
 economic political leader world. often say China statesmanlike
 promising devalue currency current circumstances. think circumstances
 also require upset apple cart. So, would agree change proposal,
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 would remove bias. lot comfortable saying Tom Hoenig made
 soundbite.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. concern meeting meeting drifting situation

 going much affected meeting next. However, happens

 announcement every meeting, although think Alan Blinder leaned
 direction. three years passed since then,
 Committee experience announcing changes, seems
 appropriate Committee reconsider policy.
 discussions issues past, Committee
 weighed two broad considerations. drawing February
 1995 discussion well Dave Lindsey's memo information
 have. one hand, providing rather less information
 viewed generally better public policy. responsibility public
 agency explain activities democratic society, enhances
 accountability agency. addition, average time,
 markets work better understand Committee
 thinking concerns are. is, changes market prices
 tend stabilize economy help Committee achieve
 goals. think two caveats here. First, always easy
 Committee convey intentions concerns. subject
 misinterpretation, certainly experience time time.
 Second, volatility may increase events validate expectations.
 Moreover, Committee statements help frame press reporting press
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 
 coverage policy hopefully educate public way.
 Committee statements official releases give you, members
 Committee, guidance statements intermeeting
 periods. positive aspects.
 hand, Committee anticipated drawbacks making
 additional announcements releasing additional information, especially
 announcements information feed back policy process itself,
 making difficult reach right decision.
 discussions years, market reaction viewed
 potential problem well benefit. reasoning
 Committee wanted move interest rates, would change policy. fact
 changed policy suggested think conditions
 right changing interest rates. 1995 particular, several Committee
 members expressed concern announcement could lock
 market expectations reduce flexibility would set situations
 market expected action Committee would
 worry disappointing expectations.
 One question raised time whether announcing "no change"
 decision would make difficult implement intermeeting changes,
 including delayed contingent changes. past, Committee
 time time made decisions meetings change policy stance
 next days weeks meetings data came certain way.
 recall decision like December 1991. Committee
 want announce "no change" decision able make
 change within next weeks incoming data certain
 kind. current announcement meeting phrased
 "there announcement" rather "the Committee
 changed policy."
 Committee also concerned announcing symmetries
 asymmetries could seen precommitment
 intermeeting period next meeting well. directive
 released, symmetries asymmetries would much
 consequential, partly market reactions. prospect could
 provoke dissents could lead reduced use symmetries
 asymmetries members would concerned market
 reactions. Members commented time tilts contributed
 policy flexibility consensus building, concerned
 something would reduce use tilts policy process.
 also concern wording press statement.
 Members anticipated difficulties reaching agreement consensus,
 especially statements forward-looking implications future

 action, nothing take focus words
 themselves, words might important statement
 Committee take action, would examined
 implied future statement explained something
 Committee done. March meeting, number
 concerned nuances "no change" directive tilt change
 tilt could captured short statement.
 addition pros cons, number issues
 could think process reaching decision
 would need thought disclosure policy going
 change. One question whether ways accomplishing
 objective explaining "no change" decision making
 announcement every meeting. One possibility obviously would
 implement February 1995 decision issue occasional rare
 statement.
 directive released, minutes speeded help
 explain directive? Even speeded up, minutes would still
 released lag directive, least would help
 explain Committee's decision shorter lag.
 directive wording looked again? Committee look directive
 wording tilts August 1997, year ago,
 unable reach consensus changes. Another issue treat
 dissents alternative views.
 concern might whether issues considered
 broader context interactions FOMC members staff

 appropriate tell outsiders, guidelines remain informal.
 question is, codified least discussed again?
 Finally, change procedures,
 announced public? change something today,
 Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony would natural possibility.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 MR. BOEHNE. topic basis lot discussion time
 time, think worthwhile bring back discuss circumstances
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 change, people's views change, Committee's membership changes. would like
 provide observations first time this.
 believe us around table start bias toward giving public
 information. think two basic reasons end disclosing tilt
 regularly making statements change policy. come view
 quality information would releasing quality deliberations
 around table.
 think beneficial give public lot information monetary policy,
 give public lot. giving misinformation harmful. illustration, one
 needs look ambiguity surrounds tilt. Markets clear
 understanding mean "woulds" "mights." example, analysts say
 asymmetry toward tightening Committee adopted March means members
 agree rate hike likely rate cut. Others say asymmetry means members
 agree next move raise rates, though timing air. Yet another
 group says asymmetry meant prepare markets give Committee room act
 today's meeting May meeting. recall analysts explaining many years ago
 asymmetric directive meant Committee given Chairman leeway change
 rates FOMC meetings, symmetry meant Committee decided tie
 Chairman's hands. ambiguity terribly important tilt old news,
 believe ambiguity meaning asymmetry current directive plants seeds
 considerable confusion.
 issue whether could clear ambiguity. problem
 hard clarify ambiguity public clear meaning
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 asymmetry among ourselves. reason meant different things different
 Committee members different circumstances. kind situation, task crafting
 explanation mislead best challenging one likely outcome
 effort end exercise frustration one produce boilerplate.
 second reason increasing amount disclosure effect
 quality deliberations. Quicker complete disclosure already changed
 nature Committee's deliberations. disclosure do,
 mislead changed nature proceedings. recall
 participating routine, vigorous, freewheeling debates room decided
 release transcripts. Now, us read prepared remarks Districts national
 economy even comments near-term policy sometimes crafted advance.
 Prepared statements rare exception rather rule started release
 transcripts.
 issue early release tilt change nature deliberations.
 think will. Announcing tilt current directive ultimately lead us avoid
 asymmetry altogether. think eliminate consensus-building tool benefited
 decisionmaking process helped avoid hardening positions. Announcing tilt
 current directive decided change policy immediately inevitably
 invite speculation even lobbying individuals timing next move.
 suspect time majority Committee develop preference symmetric
 directives avoid kinds announcement effects.
 cases Committee adopted asymmetric directive, voted

 cases, perhaps all, asymmetric directive helped build larger majority

 sense last night wished closer us now.
 think send louder, stronger message change funds rate
 consensus-building, collective-accountability approach. asymmetry

 bad? Maybe not. came away discussion last night, sensed
 better way things here.
 bottom line releasing tilt current directive likely give
 public much useful information monetary policy, likely reduce quality
 deliberations ability build consensus.
 leads issue releasing statement meetings
 change existing policy stance without identifying tilt directive. believe
 statement would fairly quickly lead demands identify tilt. cannot avoid making
 tilt known long start make regular announcements. would happen
 announce tilt outside observers would pore every word
 announcement effort determine whether tilt not. So, think two go
 together.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. thoughtful evaluation historical

 around issue keep ending spot exactly reasons Ed Boehne
 mentioned. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, strongly agree President Boehne,
 said, preempted substance statement wanted
 make. indulge me, would like go ahead try expand Ed
 Boehne said.
 sit earlier subcommittee, mentioned, strongly supported
 changes adopted early 1995. would strong concern making
 changes discussed Lindsey paper. presumption,
 course, information released activities public body basically good thing,
 would concur view information meets two criteria. first
 useful helpful society, case think talking market
 participants balancing positive way beneficial potentially harmful effects
 may exist perspective. second criterion would negative impacts
 critical policymaking processes, Ed Boehne suggested, policy's intended result
 outweighed benefits earlier release. view, notion release
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 immediately fails criteria. Let comment them. do,
 would like make points.
 first point debatable, believe start making regular
 announcements, soon find locked time whether
 like not. may, would like call attention statistics Table 1
 page 12 Dave Lindsey's paper. table records 152 decisions. include 69 decisions
 change policy 83 decisions change. table also shows tilts existed
 time decisions made. considering symmetry tilt analysis. Eighty
 decisions accurately foretold existing tilt time made.
 52.6 percent total. Seventy-two inaccurately foretold existing tilt,
 47.4 percent. impressive guideline future decisions. think good
 news bad news. good news clearly shows FOMC always looking
 incoming data open mind trapped previous sentiment. bad
 news immediate release would obviously reveal FOMC members
 thinking group time meeting, tilt close perfectly worthless
 predictor FOMC fact do. Fifty-fifty would perfectly worthless
 analysis.
 two criteria, first net impact society
 appears market. would possible objectives earlier release? first
 might better understanding Federal Reserve average time, Kohn says
 page 4 memo. sure, achieving objective highly desirable, don't
 think necessarily anything early release directive. fact, hope
 show momentarily, early release actually would counterproductive objective.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 respect market's functioning, remembering 52.6 47.4 inaccuracy split, market
 professionals watch Fed closely immediately know facts. learn
 nothing already know, going continue analysis
 act accordingly. case general public, believe would soon
 become quite disillusioned lack follow-through would perceive,
 going look actions; going study reasoning
 carefully crafted language releases. personally doubt whatsoever
 unfulfilled tilts would harm credibility Committee public. Would damp
 volatility? don't think short term, tilt forecasting power.
 speculators would respond "ho hum" perhaps feed information marginally
 assessments. odds direction next policy change might shift little,
 volatility market would continue speculation continued.
 would concern immediate releases would leave us wide open political
 demagoguery persons known us. Take 47.4 percent time
 operative tilt followed. hear right now, "the Fed misleading public," "the Fed
 manipulating market," "the Fed indecisive," "the Fed integrity," forth.
 announce tilt toward tightening, get incessant drumbeat gets
 settled one way other. eventually act, engage demagogic
 rhetoric say forced us back down. act tighten, get
 rhetoric get now. announce tilt ease, demagogic rhetoric going ask us
 hesitating, dithering; easing clearly desirable; clearly needed;
 already late. Then, ease, claim forced us ease,
 eased 50 basis points, 25, late anyway.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 brings criterion number two. release information good unless
 affects policymaking process results seriously perverse manner, think
 would three ways. Two already mentioned. first
 Committee would view lose credibility general public, would weaken
 ability conduct effective monetary policy. Secondly, think political demagoguery
 would dangerous sense would hard us ignore. worst
 unlikely result would point might feel obliged assert independence
 act way would harsh perhaps premature.
 Thirdly, Ed Boehne said minute ago, think symmetric/asymmetric
 convention useful. depressurizes uncertainty. legitimizes uncertainty
 legitimizes delay delay appropriate. helps build consensus. think regular
 announcements would ultimately cause us lose use useful convention.
 FOMC wants change policy, wants decide "no change plus
 tilt," result. immediately announce tilt without
 policy move, likely view announcement would move market least
 time, possibly equivalent one-half policy move maybe more,
 sometimes market would react all. would never know. sat voted,
 knowing tilt going released, would able anticipate
 degree certainty effect would market. would create likelihood
 unintended unpredictable policy change. believe happened couple
 times, would feel burned would soon cease use symmetric/asymmetric
 convention. think would important loss couple ways. would frequently
 force Committee timing decisions basis would otherwise choose
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 might unwise. Secondly, Ed Boehne said, think would remove useful
 legitimate consensus-building tool.
 think accident central bank significance
 anywhere uses immediate release. opinion, either. think
 right point. Let us try fix it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, going respectfully take opposite view
 supported Ed Boehne Mike Kelley. Incidentally, would like thank Dave
 Lindsey memorandum think laid choices well, especially roadmap.
 huge help, anyway.
 believe consideration question whether disclose tilt
 immediately needs start asking whether tilt useful general deliberations,
 whether released not. believe is. view, need consider tilt language
 forces Committee keep closer touch consensus specify precisely
 point time. see it, facilitates taking timely policy actions. also allows
 Committee collectively individual members express concern expectation
 one side neutrality without necessarily favoring immediate change
 federal funds rate. always work way practice, certainly
 principle.
 fact tilt language useful necessarily mean releasing
 immediately would facilitate implementation policy. view
 would constructive, would cite three main reasons view. already
 alluded to. First, know markets like surprises, view work
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 better surprised. Releasing tilt immediately would keep markets better
 informed better apprised direction likely move time
 way help better prepare markets impending changes.
 Second, seems principle guided decision back
 February 1994 begin disclosing changes funds rate target immediately applicable
 here. understood then, principle greater transparency better less
 transparency unless clearly negative consequences greater transparency
 deliberative process. respect differing opinion expressed,
 convinced procedure would necessarily negative effect deliberations.
 fact, think make argument might enhance circumstances.
 think Mike Kelley's point demagogued good one, side that,
 immediate release would reduce problem leaks. think also would reduce
 vulnerability politically sensitive charge secrecy, excessive secrecy. me,
 one serious charges leveled central bank society.
 Immediate announcement tilt would work reduce problem.
 Finally, immediate disclosure tilt would enable markets public generally
 interpret incoming data background fuller knowledge Fed's current
 position, even recognizing position might change. example, stronger-than-expected
 data coming disclosure upside tilt would likely produce reaction
 markets would cause long-term interest rates rise little way enhance role
 long-term interest rates play automatic stabilizers economy.
 Committee accepts position, do, next issue would
 implement it. preference would release operating paragraph directive
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 every meeting. know language exactly Shakespeare,
 fact use explain decisions meeting convey decisions Desk.
 going continue that, see compelling reason withholding
 information public. also see reason release anything beyond
 operating paragraph--the language directive. think would make sense, Mr.
 Chairman, continue rely testimonies speeches convey Committee's
 broader thinking underlying economic developments condition decisions.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. question Kohn making comment. Don,
 referred occasions change policy saw possibility would
 next week meeting depending incoming data. affect
 wording directive? recall?
 MR. KOHN. No, don't recall exactly. believe Committee adopted strong
 asymmetrical tilt. thinking December 1991 discount rate cut full
 percentage point federal funds rate cut 1/2 percentage point less week
 December meeting. members left meeting strong presumption
 wanted get package easing actions together included discount rate
 federal funds rate. think strong tilt presumption directive, don't
 remember exact language.
 MR. PARRY. cannot remember either. Let make comments.
 interesting points made regard reasons might want announce
 changes tilt. believe advantages making announcement
 change tilt well change funds rate itself. Announcing decisions
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 concerning tilt would view provide additional information markets would
 enable function efficiently. talked past conditioning
 markets. effective tool that. Otherwise, sometimes depend
 timing testimony speeches going given Chairman.
 simple way accomplish thing.
 also think announcements would cut leaks. problems
 leaks associated tilt. Announcing changes latter would make decisions
 change meaningful effect tilt would become additional instrument
 policy. see good thing, bad thing Governor Kelley implied. times
 seem agreement clear consensus particular decision
 tilt actually means. obvious. seems making public
 announcement would require clarity within Committee means,
 could positive development.
 also believe occasion availability unannounced tilt provided
 way us defer making tough decisions policy actions taken. worry
 little policy regular announcements could cause us use tilt, doesn't
 turn way. One approach thinking
 announcement could actually entire directive rather operating paragraph,
 haven't thought enough that. seems full directive, may

 maybe first step announce tilt comprehensible way. signal

 signal us putting markets would difficulties Mike
 Kelley Ed Boehne discussed rather eloquently. believe would end

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start saying
 favor of. favor releasing tilt, full directive, operating paragraph
 directive. believe probably noise value above.
 said that, think increased disclosure increased communication served
 us well balance years. conclude somehow, least I'm
 entirely convinced somehow, stumbled optimality [laughter]
 right thing. So, giving thought incrementally, would
 describe another small step toward providing additional information.
 attracted to, think comes largely discussion
 meeting two ago, would statement thinking every meeting. part,
 statement would retrospective rather prospective, would help explain
 came cases changed policy also
 change policy. Kohn already suggested, drafting something like probably
 going easy. hand, us Reserve Banks
 experience communicate discount rate discussion decision

 think would another small step toward improving communication. judgment
 would received well marketplace elsewhere would help people understand
 thinking about, concerned about, difficult tradeoffs
 Governor Rivlin referred to.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. want comment briefly. think far easier

 MR. STERN. could well right. suppose could, wanted to, try
 internally deciding go public see meeting two whether could
 craft statement people agreed with. Presumably, would want something
 back mind meeting began, could proceed there. way
 approaching seeing difficult might be.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. try think issue, start three elements.
 policy decisions; policy rationale try convey markets;
 internal policy debate. think important internal policy debate kept
 confidential complete free exchange.
 terms policy decisions, believe disclosed promptly
 market part avoid leaks part provide clearest possible direction market
 participants avoid problem different market participants different positions
 getting information different times. past, funds rate decision announced
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 every meeting, market participants, experts, got information first,
 think wise way operate.
 terms rationale, fully articulated rationale impossible. never
 going agree exactly things. come somewhat different directions.
 rationale incorporated directive very, general. mostly boilerplate.
 don't understand difficulty releasing full directive almost boilerplate,
 minimal common ground agree on. So, would favor
 releasing directive. cannot imagine release would cause us grief.
 issue comes question whether tilt policy decision
 not. policy decision, seems belong directive
 directive statement telling Open Market Desk
 underlying rationale that. think tilt could used constructively convey sense
 balance risks, likely future direction policy decisions. believe point
 Bob Parry making. course, came first meeting back
 March facing issue. talking whether
 providing signal markets future policy direction, thought moving
 asymmetry might useful regard. Maybe like half step funds rate.
 might different interpretations exactly is, think would useful keep
 directive treat part policy decision, providing sense market
 future direction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. struggling issue long everybody
 knows, tentatively favor releasing operational paragraph, something like it,
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 every meeting essentially reason Bill Poole gave. time,
 understand arguments Ed Boehne, Mike Kelley, Chairman made.
 think system fundamentally broken, don't care passionately this. think
 Governor Rivlin made two good suggestions would endorse. way, group
 established try draft paragraph, want it. [Laughter] I'm used
 university-professor speak central-banker speak. participation would outrage
 terms comparative advantage, [laughter] think could written better.
 terms suggestion Gary Stern made providing information

 want him. So, would suggestion.
 Let also raise one issue. intermediate step might consider taking
 would release minutes slightly instead slightly following meeting.
 asked dinner last night. Bank England, know, considering
 possibility. Chairman indicated one reason could
 contingent language minutes. many fun things occurring morning
 haven't chance read minutes carefully figure much, believe
 much. think minutes could moderately rewritten. difficult
 periods tightening. easing, heroes nobody cares much.
 tightening, hard do, circumstance see lot advantage
 giving warning deed. So, don't go way releasing
 operational paragraph immediately meeting, possible intermediate step release
 whole minutes little next meeting.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think already
 thoughtful discussion topic. try add incrementally can. believe
 opportunity take another small step toward greater transparency. believe
 move would constructive additional information would help participants
 financial markets better understand FOMC's assessment risks. would allow
 FOMC better prepare public changes policy might lie ahead.
 Let comment three issues. First, change announcement policy?
 Second, add tilt policy announcement? Third, immediately
 release full directive?
 believe announcements used occasion even
 change policy. First, significant uncertainty whether policy would
 change, might explain chose change policy. Second, expected
 change policy not, might explain why. Third, change policy
 changed tilt directive, explain why. hand,
 position feel compelled make announcement case
 expected change policy not.
 Whether policy symmetric asymmetric simple way conveying
 important information market public generally FOMC
 weighs risks going forward. believe announce assessment risks
 meeting. Would make less use asymmetric bias? think agree
 honest use procedural change enhance public transparency, use less.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 think memos received issue contained two interesting arguments
 immediately releasing entire directive. First, said opening paragraph
 written meeting basically vacuous. Second, noted language
 directive neither says means means says. Thinking even
 seconds suggests obvious solution. First, might eliminate first paragraph
 perhaps replace announcement. Second, could improve language says
 mean honestly say mean say. first preference publish
 new improved directive. second best announce tilt decision following
 meeting. addition, depending Committee's decision, would like provide
 explanation change funds rate, change tilt, no-change directive
 circumstances detailed above.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. listening number
 good arguments people much longer tenures area, weigh
 little. believe two decisions make. first whether make
 announcements meetings change policy. think answer
 "no" don't think decision represents consensus sense
 decision change policy. Bill Poole others suggested many
 differing reasons individual members Committee may decide make change
 policy. difficult, point out, Mr. Chairman, write clear summary statement
 decision. spend fair amount time discussing factors relating policy
 preferences coming consensus changing policy, would hard
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 pressed state clearly concisely reasons consensus. exercise would
 productive.
 Secondly, respect announcing tilt, actually see close call, though
 slight preference favor making announcement. reason believe
 tilt reflect change policy consensus needed make change. So, think
 useful inform markets variety reasons others alluded to. One
 often want condition market expectations one way another. may done
 statements speeches make, Mr. Chairman, sense releasing
 decision tilt meeting easier way accomplish result. Secondly,
 think indeed educate markets means. Mike Kelley pointed table
 would interpret indicating quite undecided adopt tilt. One
 things might undertake make announcement would educate
 market exactly means. often find people press ask whether think
 risks one direction other. tilt way disclose Committee thinks
 risks are, might helpful, though could also step back
 get new information. think indicates responsible public servants opposed
 irresponsible public servants. concerned people belittle us ask us
 changed minds always new information assess
 decision.
 Finally, understand origin this, language tilt read
 suggests aimed intermeeting actions. seems moved away
 intermeeting adjustments target funds rate, therefore perhaps tilt taken
 slightly different meaning disclosed clearly readily public.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 reasons, close call, would favor disclosing tilt making
 statements made change policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. beneficiary many years

 come side issue. comfortable kinds
 comments Al Broaddus Bob Parry made following reasons. First all, would

 Second, guess unspoken assumption turning back

 also start underlying bias transparency information
 better less. would argue serious observers financial markets elsewhere
 policymaking sophisticated enough understand nuances announce tilt
 also able interpret changes economy announcements
 to.
 argument would underscore without repeating
 announcing tilt would avoid misinformation spread couple meetings ago.
 believe going happen again. unfortunate time. struggle
 deal misinformation, think avoiding worth something. think David
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 Clementi's comments last night suggest Bank England's early experience
 delayed information given type problem. So, announcing decisions
 view avoid risk call "slips," "leaks." would prefer put
 charitable spin assume simply time time may say something
 wished not. cannot happen already made announcement.
 also agree comment small step take reduces sense
 secrecy surrounds activities long-term interest organization. simply
 need move little direction. don't believe make announcements
 ad hoc basis one meeting another. think routine use
 every meeting. cleanest simplest way would fact release operational
 paragraph directive. takes care announcing tilt also accommodates Al
 Broaddus's proposal announce fed funds target every meeting,
 changed it. "slam dunk" issue, modest preference come
 side it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. think someone empirical study central
 bank behavior, least last couple decades fiat monies unanchored gold
 standard something else, would conclude asymmetric bias toward easier
 money. reason, course, relates existence asymmetrical political bias toward
 easy money, already alluded to. that, seen search

 6/30-7/1/98
 
 asymmetric bias toward tightening least neutralize asymmetric bias toward ease.
 sense, would never favor asymmetric bias toward ease, announced unannounced,
 redundant. [Laughter]
 also question value stated bias toward tightening, whether released
 immediately later, signaling comes that. Governor Gramlich stated
 feels value signaling communicating advance going do.
 look Bank England May, see downside

 convinced even on-again, off-again asymmetric bias desirable. tend
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 reinforce unfortunate conviction contemporaneous data heavy weight policy
 rather long-term strategic focus.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, wind agreeing
 fine explanations President Boehne Governor Kelley supported
 number people, let say why. First all, bit history: reason decided
 February 1994 announce changes funds rate partly transparency partly
 ethics. Committee's previous policy making decision Desk
 New York Bank effect apprise cognoscenti operations market seemed,
 view someone business 22 years, verge unethical.
 reason clearly effect letting insiders know unwashed knew. So,
 one main reasons changed practice view right thing
 do, moral thing do. time, also decided change tilt,
 would announced, got announcement mode mentioned
 earlier.
 seems go one two ways present time. either stay
 are, think do, move announcing soon
 possible policy decision been. think number people latter
 persuasion concluded would probably issue cleaned-up operational paragraph
 understandable average person. see big problem paragraph
 would inevitably state baldly fact sophisticated message. Monetary policy
 "on off" switch partially on, partially switch, tilt.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 rather something one trying order better economy end day
 good American people people around world.
 think present policy, make announcement change
 federal funds rate, clear specific. easily understandable. need
 additional explanation doing, ideally Humphrey-Hawkins
 testimony or, not, Chairman either create take advantage speech opportunity.
 great advantage unusually capable spokesman, able provide
 measures subtlety nuances believe important part policy
 message. simply cannot announcement release day
 meeting. did, would exactly problem Ed Boehne described well
 would spend whole meeting shadowboxing going say end
 meeting. would take spontaneity meeting, already
 unspontaneous enough knowledge whole transcript eventually going
 released. So, people come meeting prepared remarks. always hard
 believe prepared remarks, spend lot time listening
 people trying share information us.
 think releasing anything day meeting would make meeting
 completely unspontaneous set piece, result would poor monetary policy.
 wonderful transparent monetary policy. could best possible monetary
 policy transparent monetary policy, think would ideal. don't think
 both. view better best possible monetary policy explained
 American people way fact works quite well, now. So,
 much favor retaining present formula.
 
 6/30-7/1/98
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Coming meeting today, second choice announce
 bias. thought would ultimate choice didn't think first choice
 would get anywhere. first choice would stop voting formally bias. talk
 it; rough idea us stands; know consensus
 seems be. Accordingly, see lot advantage formal vote
 dilemma whether release vote not. However, found President Boehne's
 Governor Kelley's initial remarks persuasive, particular convinced
 announce tilt. partially convinced benefit

 transparency goal want context thinking
 
 release information public, believe Governor Gramlich good

 focus getting minutes good shape soon possible want release early,
 would way enhance transparency. think immediate release tilt
