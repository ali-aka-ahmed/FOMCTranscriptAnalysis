 9/29/98
 
 agre bill pool adopt chang todai, although mai
 make us littl less aggress chang direct languag. agre tom
 hoenig said, unlik bob mcteer, would like retain tilt direct. on thing
 worri about, said past, wai make polici could

 posit chang mind think would view context whether good
 thing light recent event. don't think would lose credibl. so,
 inclin downplai argument.
 chairman greenspan. vice chair.
 vice chairman mcdonough. mr. chairman, think might worth
 think chang it. on realiti
 releas minut meet two dai follow meet, decis tilt
 earlier meet mai interest longer import. alreadi
 decid either eas eas tighten tighten meet took place
 two dai befor. thought us tilt serv caus well?
 view help us focu want term guid polici on
 meet next least term longer-term view head. think
 serv us well.
 
 9/29/98
 
 decid releas minut earlier, probabl good
 idea, analysi collect psycholog group fact, alic rivlin
 suggest, whole lot "tilt." reason go announc
 tilt either right awai shortli next meet releas minut earli,
 creat difficult conundrum central bank. central banker suppos
 believ price stabil. even symmetr approach inflat, think
 mani us ar, sens oppos inflat deflat, public
 believ central banker suppos inflat fighter. remind
 everi deflat also. envis us sit around tabl
 sai ought direct bias toward tighten, us would
 sai ought go ahead tighten. want tighten meet,
 would better announc meet think later.
 latter would view make us look littl question judgment least
 strength charact. hand, think eas sure
 want eas given meet, peopl would conclud rather reason thing
 central banker do. so, earli announc would wind view
 real world like tilt toward eas less like tilt toward firm.
 even though believ would good idea principl releas minut
 earli, therefor don't feel strongli whether announc tilt absenc
 tilt shortli meet, think like announc us tilt
 would becom fairli rare phenomenon. time think econom
 condit, financi market, monetari condit might appropri
 eas monetari polici point, good central banker might entir sure
 
 9/29/98
 
 need eas quit yet, would it. therefor, i'm sure would
 accomplish chang procedur.
 summar, prompt announc make us look like believ transpar;
 good. make us look like share inform american peopl;
 good. term actual serv interest american peopl well--and think
 phenomen good job regard, leav collect modesti asid--i
 sure chang announc procedur would improv perform.
 chairman greenspan. presid moskow.
 mr. moskow. mr. chairman, tend agre presid boehn also
 presid mcdonough. hard argu transpar. obvious, want
 releas much inform possibl. design system start,
 cannot imagin would design system would requir us make two decis. on
 might decis maintain unchang polici decis whether
 want tell world might tighten eas later. altern, might take
 action announc shortli meet whether direct includ either two
 tilt. seem logic central bank would want that.
 us tilt purpos, try design system around
 histori. wouldn't design wai start afresh didn't take account
 us past.
 believ agre announc tilt time next
 meet, practic result would would us much less. actual, though,
 exist system seem work rather well. unusu circumst august
 meet chang symmetr direct. juli minut, releas shortli
 meet, indic upward bia. interim, august meet
 
 9/29/98
 
 septemb meet, chairman consult us jackson hole,
 subsequ announc direct longer upward bia. so, think that,
 whole, system announc decis work rather well year
 see need chang point.
 chairman greenspan. presid jordan.
 mr. jordan. thank you. regard minut, agre releas
 soon prepar, even though releas sooner impos burden
 staff us review approv them.
 releas tilt, though, persuad number comment todai
 releas immedi, us it. therefor, want releas tilt immedi!
 [laughter] persuad time cost tilt outweigh benefit term

 9/29/98
 
 chang. tilt mai serv function term build onsensu,
 avail, would straight vote. would chang polici
 would not.
 chairman greenspan. governor kellei.
 mr. kellei. mr. chairman, discuss issu earlier, spoke
 length idea earli releas still feel same. would like restat view
 briefli, mai, even though concern alreadi express. first all,
 pleas recal lindsei paper support earlier discuss show
 past 12 year, tilt place time fomc decis direct
 decis 52.7 percent time. 47.3 percent time, decis
 differ exist tilt. thu, tilt nearli perfectli worthless predictor
 polici decis. [laughter]
 view, problem give us three reason chang
 announc practic, provid notion result would
 did. first, record show earli releas past decad would frequent
 misl gener public, concern deed fine nuanc
 econom reason. consequ, convinc earli releas would
 experi sever loss credibl lifeblood polici's effect. second,
 earli releas asymmetri would often equival polici move
 committe decid take, committe could never know vote
 forc might inadvert set motion hour later announc

 exist publicli known 6- 8-week old posit could influenc adopt less

 [laughter] said, would support chang committe's wish, either
