 Questions Peter?
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Peter, mentioned communication.
 research I've seen suggests intervention like this,
 effect, it's mainly way communicating future likely policy
 actions. mind, think prospects

 MR. FISHER.
 MR. BROADDUS.
 
 dollar would trade off.
 Significant downside risk or--
 
 MR. FISHER.
 It's hard put number that. Let
 start saying Committee something range
 market expecting, I'm sure dollar move
 abruptly. think tend pip pip little
 bit happened previous actions Committee. think
 inaction Committee could downside risk dollar.
 market fairly neutral point. interbank sense,
 position inaction could result significant dollar

 MR. JORDAN. really follow-up question.
 coordinated intervention like one participated May

 place fundamentals. Everybody knows intervention
 coordination. share us nature
 communication among central banks ministries finance,
 whether market correctly perceived communication

 Mr. Issing present discussion know. Mr.
 Tietmeyer's statement--the excerpts speech,
 deliberately released early--and size Bundesbank operation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. issue never came up, least
 conversations. Governor Lindsey.
 MR. LINDSEY. Peter, given Chairman said,
 agree with, given said--that even policy moves
 along lines market expectations, there's going upward
 movement dollar--that opens question next
 means may another run dollar. long
 expect latest intervention hold? suppose intervention
 last August bought us 9 10 months. assume second
 intervention buy something less 9 10 months.

 ammunition left?
 MR. FISHER. regard risk dollar going
 forward, would focus dollar/yen exchange rate. think
 operation action Bundesbank last week whatever
 Committee realm expected, put
 way, tend stabilize dollar/mark rate. don't see big
 downward potential dollar/mark rate terms. yen,
 though, locus attention particularly run-up

 context, whether Administration maintains current

 However, dollar get G-7 Summit roughly

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Peter, variation Al Broaddus's
 question. know, Europeans somewhat concerned
 effect actions long-term rates.

 market anticipate think take
 action today would upward effect European rates
 actions sufficiently decoupled rates ours?
 MR. FISHER. Well, history last three four
 months guide, I'd say would expect impact
 long end. It's hard imagine won't impact.
 think, though, seen decoupling period-between last meeting now--than saw previous periods.
 So, sense modestly hopeful would
 negative impact long end. think Bundesbank's actions
 last week probably going helpful regard.
 moves mid-April tended squeeze expectations
 rate reductions, put back last week's action
 may help decouple European rates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, questions?
 not,

 Questions Joan?
 
 Jerry.
 
 MR. JORDAN. February started announce
 actions, standard practice daily program protest
 federal funds rate move away intended rate, maybe sometimes
 going saw reserve needs current
 maintenance period. Since February we've announced decisions
 three times, monitoring Call eight weeks since
 March meeting least couple occasions
 appeared still needed protest rate indicate
 policy changed even absence announcement.
 sounded like Street still thinks possibility
 could change funds target without announcing change
 therefore daily program still account that.

 right? would help clarify situation you?
 MS. LOVETT. Well, think really stake
 announced changes made, market
 still sees always looking we're going make
 change future. occasions think
 should, move funds rate immediately morning well
 kind announcement Committee would likely.
 rate sits demonstrate something
 contrary. couple occasions market thought
 data perhaps going action

 Part theory seems work people

 actions.
 MR. JORDAN. still people think
 might change intervention level funds rate without
 announcement?
 MS. LOVETT. Yes, people still think
 that's possibility; hasn't ruled
 mentioned announcements necessarily
 time. think market tends set series time
 points. looks announcements discount rate within
 certain period time morning, policy announcements time
 that, always possibility something signaled
 ahead announcement. Even forthcoming,
 circumstances move funds rate ahead Fed.
 example, day employment data release Friday, May 6,
 people didn't think Fed would take action day,
 still moved funds rate theory perhaps
 Federal Reserve would something following Monday. thus
 constellation funds rate would balance
 period suggested worth pushing rate up.
 
 -6-
 
 5/17/94
 
 MR. JORDAN. they've come believe increases
 funds rate accompanied announcement,
 absence announcement would seem lessen need protest.
 protest action would occur saw need drain reserves
 felt add reserves funds rate high.
 Shouldn't absence announcement, would indicate
 funds rate target changed, effect
 protest move? protest move you're going
 wind taking back otherwise would.
 MS. LOVETT. Well, guess it's really anticipatory
 moves we're talking about; it's actual Fed moves; it's
 market anticipating Fed moves occur.
 MR. JORDAN. Well, what's difference failure
 issue press release protest action Desk?
 MS. LOVETT.
 Perhaps passage time, people
 become accustomed new disclosure practices, anticipatory
 moves require protest actions. we're always going
 anticipatory moves; think that's given. market would
 view absence protesting think would require experience
 new disclosure practices.
 don't think there's enough
 experience market confident that,
 stayed pushed funds rate point higher,
 paving way Committee. We're position pave

 MR. KOHN. day March FOMC meeting nobody

 Questions either gentleman?
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, question inflation

 Last year time unpleasant inflation

 recent changes seasonal factors CPI, probably
 complete explanation; don't think is.

 perspective far development concerned ought
 brought discussion?
 know cited 6-month inflation
 rates don't look quite favorable.
 MR. PRELL. Well, clearly, trying suggest
 someone wanted look evidence things going
 well. still regard longer trends indexes quite
 relevant gauging behavior direction inflation. Last
 year, sure, spurt saw was, appears now,
 considerably matter seasonal adjustment problems. Looking back
 now, things don't appear quite bad. recent experience
 shade better anticipated months ago. latest
 data aren't better anticipated. good
 news recently, it's labor cost side. employment cost
 index first quarter considerably lower
 anticipated, view sets world right sense.
 know, wondered bit ECI increases leveled
 last year face unemployment rates considerably higher
 now, substantial reduction current inflation,
 degree shorter-run inflation expectations. So, give

 side going forward. reasonably comfortable that,
 economy follows path we're talking about, inflation trend
 remain stable perhaps shade lower. want highlight
 risks certainly underscore view room
 maneuver terms faster growth we're projecting seems
 us rather limited, one really concerned inflation.
 MR. PARRY. say latest data
 accord expectations?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Current CPI.
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, thing I'm thinking
 2.4 percent change total CPI past 12 months
 2.7 2.8 percent change core rate period
 little better expectations.
 MR. PRELL. Yes, total recent months, we're
 somewhat better.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Mike, indicated thought might
 significant revision first-quarter GDP number
 get revision. end month?
 MR. PRELL.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Yes.
 Would share us?
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, address two levels.
 One
 simply arithmetic plugging actual data
 available place assumptions BEA made.
 primarily data changed inventories, retail sales,
 construction. net, numbers would seem chop good
 percentage point 2.6 percent GDP growth rate
 estimated initially. Now, we're anticipating
 incoming data, particularly trade, perhaps come better
 BEA assumed. ultimately, perhaps next round
 revisions changes, example,
 construction, may get closer 2.6 percent. So, notionally,
 framing forecast we've thinking GDP first
 quarter probably little less 2.6 percent, probably 2
 percent plus rather incoming data mechanically
 would suggest. made estimate of, essence, best
 change second quarter, that's gives us estimate
 something 3 percent first half.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 fair amount discussion
 capacity--how much left inflationary
 pressures--and growth potential economy.
 
 5/17/94
 
 estimates, particularly growth potential, change
 seemingly small changes assumptions, like labor force participation
 rates, productivity increases, sort thing. presume
 thinking capacity growth rate maybe 2-1/2 percent
 maybe 2-1/2 3 percent. view whether we're
 likely high end range like low end,
 given recent trends labor participation appears
 fairly strong capital spending, especially equipment spending?
 MR. PRELL. working assumption that, near term,
 potential output growth 2-1/2 percent. think one might
 take optimistic view underlying productivity trend-assign increase we've seen past years
 perhaps sustainable underlying trend growth, opposed normal
 cyclical component. think that's going limb bit
 point. We've already assumed considerable pickup trend
 productivity growth experiencing prior 1990s.
 labor force side, haven't seen much lift yet labor force
 participation population trends hard read. It's
 conceivable trend labor force growth isn't even quite
 strong we've anticipated, robust historical
 standards. feel 2-1/2 percent potential reasonable
 working assumption. don't advocate Committee take
 number gospel make policies assumption close
 eyes incoming evidence. think that's reasonable
 estimate now.
 must say that, example, recent Business Week
 article much talk world changing terms
 productivity growth, think high-tech investment one
 elements story. quantitative terms, net investment
 kind equipment isn't large it's rather
 short-lived; turns relatively rapidly. capital stock
 sense isn't growing rapidly. believe
 affording firms opportunity reorganize major ways way
 things really creating disproportionate efficiences
 sense, think make case stronger growth.
 thing found puzzling article said
 this, one needn't worry much inflation.
 key argument made pressures, firms would
 ship production abroad. Well, that's rather puzzling argument.
 says basically avoid inflation sucking imports,
 doesn't really enhance domestic economic growth GDP
 sense. So, think there's loose thinking behind
 optimistic stories.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. First, follow-up Bob Parry's question

 MR. PRELL. Well, President Jordan, let say

 MR. JORDAN.

 Right, don't disagree; it's closer
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, actually, median generally

 overstating degree deceleration we're going get
 vast surprise later simply adjustment seasonal

 MR. JORDAN. Well, think median so-called

 MR. JORDAN. Don, read Bluebook saying 4-1/2

 It's certainly true markets

 MR. MELZER. Alan, would endorse recommended. I'd
 like briefly state reasons. First all, know I've
 viewed stance monetary policy accommodative
 time, think lay basis acceleration
 inflation. last three years, example, net open
 market purchases government securities totaled $100
 billion, staggering number. expansion base money
 fostered tremendous increase liquidity, narrow money
 stock, M1, increasing one third period. Secondly,
 don't think we've gained credibility financial foreign exchange
 markets respect resolve contain inflationary pressures,
 let alone achieving moving toward price stability.
 respect risk overdoing it, would agree said.
 One things looked connection prevailing
 forward rate structure, cited Greenbook;
 anticipates 150 basis points increase short-term rates
 end year. So, say, don't think move
 overdoing it.
 fact, don't keep sustained increases
 market interest rates, think run risk policy
 continues accommodative simply increase
 inflationary pressures road.
 respect statement read, would
 concerned anything interpreted reached
 neutrality, don't think really know. I'm little
 concerned maybe words--I don't alternative
 suggestion--too strongly suggest we've reached neutral stance.
 don't know is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Neither we.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Needless say, support proposal
 enthusiastically, share Tom Melzer's feelings. heard
 statement kind feelings had, Tom--that
 may tend suggest we've reached plateau reached
 neutrality. Maybe work little bit. Also, along
 lines, don't really strong feelings language
 directive, think symmetric directive would tend create
 impression reached plateau. So, would accept
 symmetric directive, preference asymmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. support 1/2 point increase, symmetric
 directive, like draft statement way is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 First Vice President Minehan.

 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased support

 MR. MELZER. One suggestion, I'm sorry butt in, maybe

 removes."

 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. initial remarks think important.
 learn fair amount think what's going
 relative yields. Normally think relative move it's
 either quality spreads, currency denomination, maturity.
 one time studied behavior interest rates periods
 crisis atmosphere relating international event:
 Suez, Bay
 Pigs Cuban missile crisis, Yom Kippur War, Iraq 1990,
 on. yield curve always steepens sharply portfolio
 managers shorten horizons. uncertainty dissipates
 yield curve flattens. That's quite different cyclical
 behavior yield curve expansion matures. think
 we're closer conditions 1978
 historical episodes. April 1978 President Carter said
 danger excess demand would spill raise prices
 latter explode. 1974, 1975,
 1976, recall, economy fairly tranquil; wages
 fairly well behaved. started change little 1977,
 nobody saw coming. least certainly didn't.
 Administration misread situation 1978 looked
 things like wages; looked lot things said
 problem inflation, wrong. never saw
 coming. I'm concerned may wrong again. struck
 go-around earlier least looking
 world inside beltway--Governors Kelley, LaWare, Phillips
 --have different feel economy sense
 twelve us.
 Certainly thought marked difference,
 I'm sure quite make that.
 I'm troubled idea saying we're neutral
 we're hold. powerful move made, would act
 anyway. None us going know advance whether 25 basis
 point difference significant not, whether it's 4-1/4 4-1/2
 4-3/4 percent. it's quite different say we're
 4-1/2 percent think it's likely next move
 sometime future. neutral implies equal
 probability next move up; never know this.
 group walks today saying we're 4-1/4 percent
 people's commentary is, last couple
 meetings, we've got go, would find troubling.
 
 -38-

 would much rather everybody walked said we're 4-1/4
 percent don't know whether next move up.
 that's lot different majority people responding
