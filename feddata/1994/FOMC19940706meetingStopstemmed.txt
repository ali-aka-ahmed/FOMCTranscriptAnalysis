 mr. truman. well, word chart show

 governor lindsei anoth question.
 mr. lindsei. realli kohn, relat
 foreign exchang oper want pick point
 bill mcdonough mention. suppos chang price
 without chang posit. let us imagin someth
 catastroph--and record meet
 hypothet--suppos drop 85 yen, pick nice
 low round number, would reaction?
 mr. kohn. joan comment well, think
 experi last month bond market would tend
 react neg. is, would concern on
 two thing: on, declin dollar/yen relationship
 indic inflat expect, might end
 affect bond market. or, two, fact rapidli
 sink dollar, given economi strength
 aggreg demand, would inflationari implic via direct
 price indirect aggreg demand channel. so, think least
 recent period, declin dollar advers
 effect bond market. period dollar
 fallen effect bond market,
 occur context much slack economi.
 chairman greenspan. also implic
 dollar continu declin. get sharp reduct
 everyon think overdon, bond market ralli.
 mr. lindsei. would reaction, show
 wall street, mr. chairman.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 think happen.
 
 mr. lindsei. would think we'd big ralli bond
 market dollar/yen rate suddenli went 85.
 ms. lovett. bond market go respond
 depend circumst caus abrupt chang
 expect long persist.
 mr. fisher. think would sens
 confid market would stai 85 whether next
 stop 75. now, confid stop there,
 would agre hypothesi ralli bond market;
 would plausibl reaction. market
 confid go stop 85, don't think would get much
 ralli bond market.
 mr. kohn.
 
 that's problem itself.
 
 mr. lindsei. confid market
 stabil factor--i pick 85 try take
 
 -11-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 worst case scenario dollar/yen fall thought 85 low
 rate would get there--wouldn't view fall

 would think
 answer ye. so, would sai market want
 overstep go overstep
 irration, let them?
 mr. fisher. haven't said anyth irration.
 i'd like meet tape clear don't
 think peopl bet million billion dollar
