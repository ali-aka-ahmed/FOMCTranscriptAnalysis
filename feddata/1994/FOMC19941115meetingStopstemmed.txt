 presid jordan.
 
 mr. jordan. mike, i've got two quit differ type
 question. first on two part product:
 go forese go on? past
 four quarter, growth manufactur product report
 someth order 6 percent so, overal economi
 substanti less that--the rest economi
 run 1-1/2 percent. larg part
 defin output wai preclud labor product gain,
 least servic. nevertheless, wind pretti good
 number past four quarter. look forecast
 next year--the first part first question
 read number happen product gain
 manufactur sector four time rest
 economi. simpli measur error don't
 know measur product rest economi
 affect judgment polici? take number
 face valu? second question is, forese go
 manufactur nonmanufactur product produc slow
 growth 2 percent output four quarter start next
 spring?
 mr. prell. technic matter, product number
 manufactur publish along overal
 product growth essenc base separ system
 current period. recent period base industri product
 data rather industri gross product data. number
 revis. isn't reason, though, think
 give grossli mislead pictur. assumpt that, inde,
 substanti growth manufactur product. i'm
 sure want subtract number overal nonfarm
 busi sector product growth get residu rest
 economi.
 chairman greenspan. actual, mike, separ gdp
 factori valu compon, don't get result
 differ number base industri product?
 mr. prell. there's big gap industri
 nonindustri sector product measur even
 exercis.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 okai.
 
 mr. prell. mayb isn't actual true; mayb
 inaccuraci measur output. would affect
 gdp number. also would affect estim potenti
 output growth. fact neutral term assess
 output gap might be. measur commensur affect.
 pattern go forward, deceler
 product growth. normal accompani signific
 deceler output growth. believ somewhat
 cyclic-adjust trend line deceler normal
 occur mid-expans. move fuller resourc util,
 expans slow; tendenc move
 back toward trend line. histor, economi move
 recessionari period, don't recess
 
 11/15/94
 
 project period. essenc, somewhat below-trend
 growth nonfarm busi product next year
 move back toward trend. basic, look growth
 product 1990s, don't see real evid
 assumpt time 1.4 percent trend growth
 nonfarm busi product mark. data seem
 conform term normal cyclic pattern.
 mr. jordan. comment it, i'm hear
 anyth suggest busi--manufactur other
 --forese fewer opportun product improv
 next year two last coupl year.
 produc quit dramat slow product? think
 troubl.
 second question involv--sorri thi.
 pair happen last four quarter
 project mid-1995, look like pattern sai,
 output grown faster project, sai, time year ago
 also faster idea potenti,
 give back that, end, wind level
 output employ would otherwis. anoth wai
 look situat pair last year
 prior year. instead match year futur, match
 year past. went period 1992 much 1993
 downward revis forecast--staff, blue chip, everybodi els;
 forecast error side relat
 expect economi capabl do.
 match 1993 1994, level todai come
 would project two year ago. then, don't
 give anyth back futur, question
 happen growth futur.

 option year ahead: on relationship would break

 relationship break down, put on asid. left three
 possibl. on sharp declin interest rate.
 would taken 20-25 percent declin interest rate
 year ago make opportun cost model hold up, given
 kind monei growth get forecast had.
 time, thought possibl
 declin bond yield fund rate would stai 3
 percent. actual would lean side think
 inflat psycholog improv, bond yield could too.
 
 11/15/94
 
 rememb chairman sai would short bond

 improv didn't happen. left two possibl:
 either nomin gdp growth doubl, shot 10 12 percent,
 m1 growth base growth collaps. got combin
 two small increas 1 percent nomin gdp growth
 mostli drop monei growth--m1 base. opportun

 look ahead, we've got four
 option:
 on relationship break down; hold asid.
 second, come on two wai.

 ms. minehan. opposit question presid boehn's:
 interest refer greenbook cessat

 11/15/94
 
 -11-
 
 ms. minehan. think special factor
 push increas price 3.8 3.6 percent rather

 mr. prell. right. time question here.
 hard sai think might get littl price
 increas announc begin year.
 ms. minehan.
 
 ye.
 
 mr. prell. so, consider amount guesswork
 involv here. but, ye, think speed effect
 exchang rate effect import price give
 bulg. howev, elimin excess pressur
 resourc 1995, forecast, risk would
 wage would begin reflect fulli higher price

 begin build higher track trend. that's felt
 import try indic kind interest rate path would
 lead slacken fairli promptli.
 ms. minehan. look side, declin

 mr. prell.
 ms. minehan.
 mr. prell.
 greenbook.
 ms. minehan.
 
 realiti never smooth!
 that's thought too!
 that's on risk note
 right.
 
 mr. prell. inventori adjust could come quickli:
 final demand taper perceiv taper
 earli next year, perhap inventori adjust would sharper.
 could move us much closer zero even conceiv neg
 gdp growth quarter, inventori might come back
 final demand still grow moder. so, certainli
 potenti sourc volatil number greater

 ms. minehan. final, look price effect
 arm issu year kick next year?
 teaser rate year low. arm

 mr. prell. go factor affect cash
