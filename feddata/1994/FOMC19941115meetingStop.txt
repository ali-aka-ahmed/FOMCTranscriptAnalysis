 Questions Mike?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. profile growth
 next 15 months find somewhat puzzling. economy fair
 amount momentum, yet rather significant falloff
 rate growth next year yield curve still
 sloping upward. think would flattening
 yield curve get dramatic slowdown. That's one piece
 puzzling. part it, even right,
 take growth 1 1-1/2
 reminiscent late 1980s.
 
 11/15/94
 
 percent, really get weak, open
 kind shock. I'm puzzled sides:
 one, get
 amount slowing kind increase rates
 talk about; side, actually end
 kind slowing, argue vulnerable
 side. two opposite concerns.
 MR. PRELL. President Boehne, think first question
 forecasting question. second one perhaps policy
 question, though obviously ingredients two
 questions. hinted Greenbook that, essence, see
 probability distribution skewed bit direction first
 question suggested--that, indeed, momentum could turn
 better maintained near term might take considerably
 greater monetary policy tightening order generate quick
 significant slackening growth, bringing economy potential
 beginning reverse regard overshooting resource
 utilization. So, take point, don't think history
 would suggest moderation growth requires total flattening
 yield curve, would say perhaps bit optimistic,
 want view way, relationship. Greenbook
 assumes reduction upward slope, latter still
 significant. pick alternative scenario, might lean
 direction talking about.
 slow growth openness shocks, economy
 always open shock could move projected path
 given amount. growth low, shock obviously could
 move economy negative territory. Maybe psychology
 different downward momentum might develop, don't
 think way coping that. fact, 1989-1990,
 period slow growth. revisions data
 revealed pattern was, wasn't
 shock occurred economy really tipped recession.
 absence shock, conceivable might skated by.
 period slow growth necessarily mean economy
 going slip recession.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, verbal presentation also
 Greenbook twice referred lenient lending terms banks
 factor strength economy. want make sure
 understand point. saying banks lenient
 one typically would see stage cycle,
 typically see? discussions bankers suggest
 anything unique cycle. matter
 fact, think respects little cautious.
 seeing something exogenous experience
 past stage cycle? so, important it?
 MR. PRELL. hard pin down, sense
 credit availability cycle sync normal
 pattern time around.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 little later?
 
 -6-
 
 11/15/94
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 sense that, interest rates
 
 coming 1991-1992, still seeing tendency toward
 tightening bank credit terms.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. And, tightening money market
 conditions, loan officers' survey preponderance
 anecdotal evidence suggested banks become
 increasingly aggressive business lending obviously
 increasingly willing extend consumer credit well.
 looked back responses senior loan officers' survey
 years back couple cycles found that, might
 expected, periods rising interest rates
 flattening term structure, had, generally
 tightening credit terms; recently tendency toward
 easing credit terms. So, think may moving unusual
 direction. may, pretty much convinced
 moving direction easier credit availability
 tended work effect rising interest
 rates demand. perspective businesses, certainly
 clear credit crunch longer credit
 availability concern firms want expand fixed
 
 investment inventories.
 MR. PARRY. guess I'm little surprised past
 seen tightening terms first year rising
 interest rates. would thought would come later.
 MR. PRELL. don't want put fine point it,
 think main point seems offsetting
 influence past year rising market interest rates.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 don't think doubt that.
 

 
 really wonder that's unique.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 not.
 
 bias
 
 measure degree ease loan officers' survey.
 
 size it?
 

 
 remember, Don?
 
 MR. KOHN. Richmond Fed study showed
 that, least back 1970s, looked like responses
 biased toward showing tightness. Now, psychology everything
 shifted radically current cycle wonder whether
 bias there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. KOHN.

 Right.

 MR. KOHN.
 
 don't know.
 
 11/15/94
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Mike, I've got two quite different types
 questions. first one two parts productivity:
 going foresee going on? past
 four quarters, growth manufacturing productivity reported
 something order 6 percent so, overall economy
 substantially less that--the rest economy
 running 1-1/2 percent. large part
 define output way preclude labor productivity gains,
 least services. Nevertheless, wind pretty good
 numbers past four quarters. look forecast
 next year--the first part first question
 read numbers happened productivity gains
 manufacturing sector four times rest
 economy. simply measurement error don't
 know measure productivity rest economy
 affect judgments policy? take numbers
 face value? second question is, foresee going
 manufacturing nonmanufacturing productivity produce slow
 growth 2 percent output four quarters starting next
 spring?
 MR. PRELL. technical matter, productivity numbers
 manufacturing published along overall
 productivity growth essence based separate system
 current period. recent period based industrial production
 data rather industry gross product data. numbers
 revised. isn't reason, though, think
 giving grossly misleading picture. assumption that, indeed,
 substantial growth manufacturing productivity. I'm
 sure want subtract number overall nonfarm
 business sector productivity growth get residual rest
 economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Actually, Mike, separate GDP
 factory value components, don't get results
 different numbers based industrial production?
 MR. PRELL. There's big gap industrial
 nonindustrial sector productivity measures even
 exercise.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. PRELL. Maybe isn't actually true; maybe
 inaccuracy measurement output. would affecting
 GDP numbers. also would affecting estimates potential
 output growth. fact neutral terms assessing
 output gap might be. measures commensurately affected.
 pattern going forward, deceleration
 productivity growth. normal accompaniment significant
 deceleration output growth. believe somewhat
 cyclically-adjusted trend line deceleration normally
 occurs mid-expansion. move fuller resource utilization,
 expansion slowing; tendency move
 back toward trend line. Historically, economy moved
 recessionary periods, don't recession
 
 11/15/94
 
 projection period. essence, somewhat below-trend
 growth nonfarm business productivity next year
 move back toward trend. Basically, looking growth
 productivity 1990s, don't see real evidence
 assumption time 1.4 percent trend growth
 nonfarm business productivity mark. data seem
 conforming terms normal cyclical pattern.
 MR. JORDAN. comment it, I'm hearing
 anything suggests businesses--manufacturing others
 --foresee fewer opportunities productivity improvements
 next year two last couple years.
 produces quite dramatic slowing productivity? think
 troubling.
 second question involved--sorry this.
 pair happened last four quarters
 projection mid-1995, looks like pattern says,
 output grown faster projected, say, time year ago
 also faster ideas potential,
 give back that, end, wind level
 output employment would otherwise. Another way
 looking situation pair last year
 prior year. Instead matching year future, match
 year past. went period 1992 much 1993
 downward revisions forecasts--staff, Blue Chip, everybody else;
 forecasting errors side relation
 expectations economy capable doing.
 matching 1993 1994, level today comes

 give anything back future, question
 happening growth future.
 framework, talk inflation, rely
 excess demand. puzzle producing idea excess
 demand. Nominal GDP growth really accelerated much.
 fact, looks last four quarters looked
 1992. put terms feel comfortable with, try
 reconcile forecast think going money
 desire hold money balances. least conceptually,
 make equivalent excess-demand-for-output model excesssupply-of-money model. well done depends
 going asset markets. conceptually, make two
 same. year ago time, said opportunity cost model
 narrow money, M1, monetary base, tracking
 well; nothing gone wrong. two years double-digit
 growth M1 base. point year ago, four
 options year ahead: One relationship would break
 down; don't want make monetary policy idea
 relationship breaking down, put one aside. left three
 possibilities. One sharp decline interest rates.
 would taken 20-25 percent decline interest rates
 year ago make opportunity cost model hold up, given
 kind money growth getting forecast had.
 time, thought possibility
 declines bond yields funds rate would stay 3
 percent. actually would leaned side thinking
 inflation psychology improved, bond yields could too.
 
 11/15/94
 
 remember Chairman saying would shorting bond
 market. course, probably would buying!
 improvement didn't happen. left two possibilities:
 Either nominal GDP growth doubled, shot 10 12 percent,
 M1 growth base growth collapsed. got combination
 two small increase 1 percent nominal GDP growth
 mostly drop money growth--M1 base. opportunity
 cost model still fit.
 look ahead, we've got four
 options:
 One relationship breaks down; hold aside.
 Second, come one two ways.
 look
 Greenbook forecast Prell path policy ask
 reasonable interest rates money growth model still
 works.
 would say interest rates remained
 today's level Greenbook forecast right, M1 growth would
 decline little next year--1 percentage point
 relationship holds.
 Or, fed funds recommendations
 correct, implies M1 growth drop 6 percentage
 points absolute level next year nominal GDP
 forecast correct. reasonable? What's going
 demand money balances velocity increase
 10 percent?
 MR. PRELL. don't think work way
 history gave forecast. think first statement
 made giving back extra growth recently
 fundamentally correct. extra growth, assess it, resulted
 overshooting sustainable levels resource utilization-levels would consistent least stability inflation
 opposed accelerating prices. tried devise scenario
 which, within reasonable period time, move back

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. opposite question President Boehne's:
 interested reference Greenbook cessation
 speed effects brings moderation CPI increases
 last part 1995. wondered whether estimates
 CPI figure might absent speed effect changes? look
 way?
 MR. PRELL. don't think precise dissection.
 One things we've pointed Greenbook
 looking acceleration--I don't want overstate this--what
 talking essence core CPI number
 going get pretty much .3 increase month rather mixture
 .2 .3 month.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Yes, right.
 
 MR. PRELL. Whether we'll able perceive month-bymonth isn't entirely clear. see involving mix
 things sort overlapping. exchange rate
 depreciation. seen raw materials prices increase.
 raw materials internationally traded imported
 instances. seen rapid growth output recently,
 econometrically, always particularly robust result-you tinker models get large small effects--that
 mere increase resource utilization produce models
 increase markups, things taper see stabilizing
 return trend. really can't parse things
 great precision. set factors think give
 little bit faster rise prices near term would
 dictated simply margin slack economy, would
 see adding maybe couple tenths underlying inflation
 coming year, that.
 
 11/15/94
 
 -11-
 
 MS. MINEHAN. think special factors
 pushing increase prices 3.8 3.6 percent rather
 uptrend?
 MR. PRELL. Right. timing question here.
 hard say think might get little price
 increase announcements beginning year.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. PRELL. So, considerable amount guesswork
 involved here. But, yes, think speed effects
 exchange rate effects import prices giving
 bulge. However, eliminate excess pressures
 resources 1995, forecast, risk would
 wages would begin reflect fully higher price
 increases, inflationary expectations would take hold, would
 begin build higher track trend. That's felt
 important try indicate kind interest rate path would
 lead slackening fairly promptly.
 MS. MINEHAN. Looking side, declining
 impact inventories, certainly smooth one. care
 comment that?
 MR. PRELL.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 MR. PRELL.
 Greenbook.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Reality never smooth!
 That's thought too!
 That's one risks noted
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. inventory adjustment could come quickly:
 final demand taper perceived tapered
 early next year, perhaps inventory adjustment would sharper.
 could move us much closer zero even conceivably negative
 GDP growth quarter, inventories might come back
 final demand still growing moderately. So, certainly
 potential source volatility numbers greater
 cyclical variation.
 MS. MINEHAN. Finally, looked price effect
 ARMs issued year kick next year?
 teaser rates year low. ARMs
 new provisions extend maturity, good portion
 kick next year.
 MR. PRELL. going factor affecting cash
 flow many households, huge effect. less huge
 one might expected we've observed year
 substantial proportion ARMs originated year
 fixed rates 5 10 years. something innovation
 cycle. going adjustment
 2 percentage point limit shorter-term ARMs.
 So,
 going produce drastic income shock 1995.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Mike, want ask question
 projection automobile market, Greenbook
 peaking quarter 15-1/2 million light vehicles--cars
 trucks--and declining modestly, almost trivially.
 Greenbook, short-term interest rates 150 basis points more.
 addition, notable feature episode, think,
 auto loan rates gone half--or less--as much

 Okay.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Let begin, Mr. Chairman,
 brief remark goings Second District.

 New York State economy continuing grow slightly slower
 rate nation. major source strength
 consumer. Retail sales strong sales existing
 houses quite high. Needless say, great
 uncertainty fiscal future state. new governor
 inherits $4 billion hole 1995 budget $34 billion,
 continues promise cut taxes. New York City dwellers wonder
 well city fare given dynamics recent
 campaign. So, think investment decisions state tax
 burden issue almost certainly put hold.
 banks District lending aggressively,
 seems reflect combination two things. Regional banks
 inside outside Second District seem trying
 increase market share. Secondly, money center banks
 cases considerable reduction, modest others,
 trading income seem somewhat aggressive lending order
 improve earnings. spreads sufficiently low

 lending standards, evidenced covenants required
 borrowers, slipping excessively.
 Switching national economy, question
 asking is:
 know didn't know last
 meeting Committee? Well, first thing know
 current recent GDP employment growth even stronger
 colleagues New York Bank thought would case
 time last meeting. case regards third
 quarter, came stronger, view current quarter,
 ratcheted even more. Second, believe even
 inventory investment slows enough becomes modest drag
 economy, real growth stay 3 percent

 growth slowing 1995 1996 much

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. three minutes ago thought that,
 even though speaking last, would things say

 thought remarkable feature Greenbook projections

 I'm persuaded strong likelihood small overshoot-we may indeed already small overshoot--and probably

 Much important next quarter longer-term

 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. I'm full agreement recommendation,
 Mr. Chairman. comments earlier fairly strong I'd like

 Governors Yellen Blinder made monetary policy lags
 are, won't see full effects done already
 certainly may today 1995 early 1996.
 However, believe labor markets data
 gotten today continue indicate overshot.
 fear,
 along Governor Lindsey, move slowly, underlying
 growth rates, consistently underestimated year,
 cause significant overshooting. case, might find
 necessary pull even harder monetary reins, perhaps
 aggregate moving full 150 basis points more, create real
 hard landing. Thus, believe move now, move strongly
 50 basis points everyone expects, go 75
 recommended, wouldn't care predict anything December.
 I'm hopeful able rein strong economy

 MR. TRUMAN. Maybe I'll add one footnote history

 1973.
 Arthur Burns President Hayes essentially
 prevailed upon Treasury take small instrument

 may big mistake happened.
 That's one example where, better worse,
 Committee time found quite supportive intervention
 question caring currency, least
 that's perceived. Governor Blinder said earlier

 sometimes prejudge perceptions great confidence.
 Chairman said, Treasury talked
 multinational, multiday operation would relatively small

 successively 3 5 days. might imagine U.S. authorities

 going. would raise that--up to, say, $3 billion

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, let raise one additional issue
 here. may recall earlier discussion, looking
 ways restrict size operations. wanted try
 disgorge foreign exchange reserves. intervene
 support dollar, moving direction.
 squeezing capability acting squeezing whole
 operation. sure Treasury thinks way,
 really asymmetry whereby resistant

 support dollar, even failed, would accomplish something-namely would reduce foreign exchange reserves.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 profit.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes, profit.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. sounds saying
 acting order restrain ability act, sure
 makes lot sense. Ted referred opportunities discuss
 proposed operations conference calls. Now, one great
 beauties U.S. Constitution, makes foreign policy
 adversaries furious, Senate's right say "no." real
 question Ted is:
 right say "no"?
 right, words actual vote approval Committee
 required, sticks closets would quite numerous
 might quite appropriate move.
 notify us
 us ask questions, think that's different issue.
 MR. TRUMAN. obviously matter Committee

 MR. MELZER. Alan, getting back said
