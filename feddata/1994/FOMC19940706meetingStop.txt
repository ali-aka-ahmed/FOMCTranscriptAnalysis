 MR. FISHER. Well, events morning gave precious
 little time. final decision intervene made

 Treasury operate market, jumped right in.
 MR. BOEHNE. immediate response market

 MR. TRUMAN. President Boehne, one comment first
 question historical perspective, think
 perspective coming from: decision intervene

 different been. decision
 taken, largely Desk's hands would
 handle intervention. contrast instances
 micro-management course recent years. think Peter
 given quite large amount resources potential use,
 although consulted change tactics, tactics
 decided Desk rather Treasury.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Reading transcript last meeting-unfortunately transcripts come back haunt us all--but
 going haunt moment, may. [Laughter] reason
 given previous intervention late April early May
 underline change policy. change
 policy intervention underlined?
 MR. FISHER. No, think may one
 problems. think spoke previously referring
 Treasury Federal Reserve policy.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. FISHER. Looking back last week, think
 change Treasury policy. clarity expressed
 evolved course week operated
 became clear, would say, toward end day subsequently.
 change statements Treasury officials making.
 looking dollar go higher rather lower.
 MR. LINDSEY. market's reaction increased
 clarity, recall, send dollar down.
 MR. FISHER. don't think increased clarity sending
 dollar down. really don't view way. Late Friday
 afternoon unnamed Treasury official finally said would rather
 dollar go down, many words
 gist it. don't think caused dollar go rather
 up. regrettable series headlines
 result President's interview radio. think overall
 remarks President made something rational person could
 agree with. map rather well remarks made
 effect fundamental reasons mark yen
 strong appreciation getting little overdone,
 think prudent intervene. came series
 headlines. first said "Clinton thinks exchange rates
 puzzling." subsequent headlines "Clinton sees reasons
 mark rise versus dollar; Clinton sees reasons yen rise
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 versus dollar." afternoon operations face headlines
 literally head-on. That, think, important cause
 dollar's weakening afternoon.
 MR. LINDSEY. Treasury know President's
 forthcoming statements?
 MR. FISHER. aware President's interview
 prior seeing come across wire.
 MR. LINDSEY.

 President aware going
 
 MR. FISHER. don't know fact. think
 briefed Treasury's views Thursday. said,
 final decision intervene made Secretary Bentsen 9:15
 9:30 a.m. Friday morning part.
 MR. LINDSEY. follow-up question. transcript
 last meeting reads asking "How long
 expect latest intervention hold? suppose intervention
 last August bought us 9 10 months. assume second
 intervention"--which late April early May-"will buy us something less 9 10 months." bought us four
 weeks.
 "Do ammunition left?" said May meeting
 "I think operation action Bundesbank last week
 whatever Committee realm expected, put
 way, tend stabilize dollar/mark rate." Well,
 didn't stabilize it. much time intervention bought us?
 last, went nine ten months four weeks.
 intervention buy us four hours four minutes? bought
 us twenty minutes, think.
 MR. FISHER. think bought us twenty
 minutes. wouldn't tell would buy us great amount time
 terms weeks months. said, think relative
 stability dollar/yen trading level 100 different
 us expecting. risk drop
 floor point, think, real; dollar/yen sentiment
 extraordinarily negative little indication
 would buyers there. Although risk big drop
 now, can't, course, prove scientifically.
 don't think buys us weeks--I'll honest you,
 don't like admit that--unless change
 market dynamics. think market views little
 oversold now. reaction dollar/mark last week
 frequently tick nervous people covered shorts.
 case--we gotten far--after April-May operation.
 MR. LINDSEY. Given interest rate differential--this
 last question, promise--what expectation yen
 DM exchange rate year now?
 MR. FISHER. You're trying make enjoy transcripts
 even less! [Laughter]
 don't forecast far myself.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Higher lower, sound?

 MR. FISHER.
 
 haven't clue.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Governor Lindsey, first question,
 correct say one purposes May 4 operation
 send message. doesn't necessarily mean purpose
 every intervention correct policy misperception.
 MR. LINDSEY. Well, Ted, don't want dig
 transcript, swear Chairman Greenspan, guess
 authoritative matters, said one list
 reasons intervening, underlining policy reason.

 minutes, substantively wrong, Mr. Chairman, please correct
 me.

 [Laughter]
 
 quite certain you've
 
 MR. LINDSEY. accusing quite correct

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. actually another
 important, think intervened reason occasion.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would say last attempt

 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 So, intervention last time didn't meet
 
 second criterion?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would think not, one
 supported it, tell fingers
 crossed; hoping.
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 implied comments thought
 
 significant risk intervened, bottom
 would dropped dollar/yen relationship.
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 anything going market morning indicated
 disorderly market?
 MR. FISHER. Well, disorderly different one context
 risk dropping trap door.
 MR. LAWARE. understand that. estimate risk
 absent speculation disorderly market
 beginning disorderly market.
 MR. FISHER. Well, Thursday afternoon Friday morning
 week looking options position, included
 written material include charts circulated
 today. referring risk reversals two equally "out
 money" options--one dollar put one dollar call. pricing

 Thursday afternoon Friday morning, dollar put offered
 2 "vols." call. People never discussed options
 prices calling phone make sure
 aware pricing development suggested market
 step back would want touch dollar/yen rate
 dropped down. So, that's precise indicator had;
 one rely assessing market sentiment,
 obviously extraordinarily bearish.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. comment rather question
 order, Mr. Chairman. say intervention,
 particularly outcome lack outcome, really bothered lot.
 think everybody saw generally unsuccessful

 MR. BLINDER. Could go back discussion

 described it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I'd like make comments
 two areas: One operation because, like Chairman,
 involved decision it. previous Friday
 midday, Peter mentioned prepared statement,
 significant weakening dollar volume.
 technically worst worlds:
 price correction
 position correction. people didn't feel good
 dollar sitting exactly essentially
 positions start day. particular
 Friday morning intervened, market much
 feel it. question, always plagues one
 intervention whether successful not,
 would happened intervened. answer don't
 know. likelihood dollar considerably
 weaker significant view. would agree Peter's comment
 ability dollar stay 98ish area
 yen since time relationship, perhaps main beneficial
 one, intervention itself. Secondly, think
 realize dollar's weakness essentially yen.
 dollar/deutschemark middle range within
 floating considerable number months. So,
 made policy statement accompany intervention,
 think people correctly thinking main thing going
 exchange market strong Japanese yen
 that's big problem macro economy Japan.
 policy issue, strongly support Chairman's
 view would unwise, think extreme, Federal
 Reserve distance active involvement
 decisionmaking area. First, purely technical matter,
 world know next quarterly publication
 exchange market activity Peter Manager Foreign
 Operations whether intervention U.S. monetary authorities
 involved Treasury Fed one
 other. So, order establish involved
 operation, since Federal Reserve Bank New York carries
 intervention operations fiscal agent Treasury, would
 make public statement sympathize
 action government. something think
 us would wish do, least certainly would not.
 ability us involved discussions
 positive influence Treasury considerable. pay
 attention us. think believe knowledge
 economics markets considerable; hope belief wellfounded important thing appear
 think. Therefore, considerable amount influence
 happens. Chairman stated supported
 operation day. appear success,
 clue would happened

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. agree everything Vice Chairman
 Chairman said still feel uncomfortable
 particular operation. Let first ask Peter follow-up question
 response gave Governor Lindsey 100 level
 yen floor on. Now, rate something 99
 market still functioning. another number that's
 magic?
 MR. FISHER. don't think one anything
 approaching magic quality aura 100 level. think
 market looks 95.50--actually 95--as sort floor;
 view chartists world. level would represent
 bottom dollar/yen rate going back early 1960s,
 taking troughs period; people rulers draw
 line there. level significance market,
 nothing approaching significance 100.
 MR. JORDAN. Part reason asked question
 one things troubles taking action
 psychological barrier. market participants say, well okay,
 level going come back again, far magic
 numbers--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Jerry, could say--I think
 Treasury acutely aware want
 protect 100 level. fact, often made statements
 effect could close eyes sudden
 readjust number 100 would feel lot
 comfortable trying defend number.
 MR. JORDAN. Peter argued wasn't view even
 Treasury's. Rather minds participants
 market.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 hand.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. JORDAN. creating situation forced
 was, might call irrational.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Well, dollar traded 100 earlier
 
 week indeed one reasons didn't operate
 felt somewhat comfortable--though think it's
 fair say greatly so--about operating point,
 approached 100 level third fourth time. First,
 rate went level came back.
 psychological aspects operating close 100, it,
 removed. remove point Peter made
 possible consequences large adjustment absence
 actions monetary authorities.
 
 MR. FISHER. dollar traded briefly 100
 rather discrete increments seen 99 screen
 several times; stay long. So, sort
 episodic venturing 100.
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -9-
 
 MR. JORDAN. Focusing reference market
 participants, magic number, psychological aspects, want
 follow-up something Al Broaddus referring to--the
 perception success failure. technical sense, doesn't
 matter whether sell $800 million assets denominated
 yen deutschemarks Joan Lovett rather mechanically buys assets
 denominated U.S. dollars amount order maintain
 funds rate. So, happens Fed going
 make portfolio substitution. people don't see Joan's actions;
 see actions. Suppose perception objective
 influence rate--that price objective
 trying prevent dollar falling cause
 rise, trying something Governor Blinder mentioned
 disorderly markets. dollar consistent
 objective. repetition those, makes Federal
 Reserve look impotent markets see Peter
 see Joan does. several
 period, image able influence markets
 tarnished.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. question either Peter Ted.
 question whether concerned extent
 current account deficit financed recently central
 bank intervention and, practical matter, closely
 monitor that.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, words Chart Show
 point. extent deficit financed
 recently official sources exaggerated basically
 counts intervention major industrial countries.
 half financing last year, say, nonindustrial
 countries whose motives private
 sector investor; don't exchange rate motive though
 may speculating exchange rate. easy track
 accurately because, second leading point, don't really
 know gets recorded official inflows official inflows.
 example, country moves dollar holdings Euromarket New York market, would show official financing
 current account deficit even though sense
 portfolio preference way currency dimension way, would
 change. So, difficult interpret numbers.
 lots countries around world different
 motivations hold assets hold
 there. That's offer.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one argues exchange rate
 affected proportion current account deficit
 financed official account, implication sterilized
 intervention affects exchange rate. would argue strongly
 goodly part official support coming
 Japanese; market every day, picking $100
 million, $200 million, $500 million, think evidence
 affecting exchange rate dubious. It's showing
 accounts because, extent picking
 Treasury bills like directly, issue Ted raising
 problem. extent picking dollars
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -10-
 
 Euro-dollar market--I don't think much evidence
 lot Euro-dollar holdings Japanese reserve accounts-then appears basically private account,
 government account. So, main concern argument
 gives credence sterilized intervention important tool
 stabilizing exchange rate. don't think evidence there.
 Governor Lindsey another question.
 MR. LINDSEY. really Kohn, related
 foreign exchange operations wanted pick point
 Bill McDonough mentioned. Suppose change price
 without change position. Let us imagine something
 catastrophic--and recording meeting
 hypothetical--suppose drop 85 yen, pick nice
 low round number, would reaction?
 MR. KOHN. Joan comment well, think
 experience last month bond markets would tend
 react negatively. is, would concerned one
 two things: One, decline dollar/yen relationship
 indicative inflation expectations, might end
 affecting bond markets. Or, two, fact rapidly
 sinking dollar, given economy strength
 aggregate demand, would inflationary implications via direct
 price indirect aggregate demand channels. So, think least
 recent period, decline dollar adverse
 effect bond markets. periods dollar
 fallen effect bond markets,
 occurred context much slack economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. also implication
 dollar continue decline. get sharp reduction
 everyone thinks overdone, bond market rally.
 MR. LINDSEY. would reaction, shows
 Wall Street, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 think happened.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. would think we'd big rally bond
 market dollar/yen rate suddenly went 85.
 MS. LOVETT. bond market going respond
 depend circumstances caused abrupt change
 expectations long persists.
 MR. FISHER. think would sense
 confident market would stay 85 whether next
 stop 75. Now, confident stopping there,
 would agree hypothesis rally bond market;
 would plausible reaction. market
 confidence going stop 85, don't think would get much
 rally bond market.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 that's problem itself.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. confidence markets
 stabilizing factors--I picked 85 trying take
 
 -11-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 worst case scenario dollar/yen fall thought 85 low
 rate would get there--wouldn't view fall
 level foundation rally bond market?
 would think
 answer yes. So, would say markets want
 overstep going overstep
 irrationally, let them?
 MR. FISHER. haven't said anything irrationality.
 I'd like meeting tape clear don't
 think people betting millions billions dollars
 anything irrational. trying serve interests
 see short run. That's important me. That's
 question, though. look asset prices see prices go
 up, demand goes short run prices go down, demand goes
 short run. whether markets stabilizing
 depends short run ends long run begins.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, economy
 New York District continued advance moderate pace late
 spring. Unemployment rates fell payroll employment rose. State
 tax collections retail sales, personal income, corporate
 franchises risen moderately far year, suggesting growth
 underlying streams personal income, corporate income,
 retail sales. Vacancy rates commercial office space continue
 decline metropolitan areas, permits residential
 construction new, single-family homes snapped back
 weather-reduced lows first quarter. New York City,
 however, several recent economic indicators, including establishment
 employment, city government payrolls, initial claims
 unemployment insurance suggest economic pause may
 developing. financial sector, needless say,
 quite happy experience first half 1993.
 overall basis, District economy maintains reasonable pace,
 although still compare rather poorly areas
 country.
 forecast national level that, even given
 unchanged monetary policy, real GDP growth gradually taper
 roughly 3-1/4 percent rate first half year
 around 3 percent second half 2-1/2 percent 1995.
 think slowing growth likely lagged result run-up
 long-term interest rates. forecast bit softer growth
 one prepared last meeting reflects 50
 basis point increase funds rate time slightly
 higher path long-term interest rates anticipated.
 think increase long-term interest rates particularly
 affect housing related elements consumer spending,
 furniture appliances. Indeed, available evidence suggests
 single-family housing starts may begun slow, although
 convincing data remains seen. think higher
 rates also affect motor vehicle sales perhaps slow
 capital spending. forecast would put us rather along lines
 Gary Stern suggests. problem think risks
 forecast asymmetric. much risk economy
 less strong, major risk
 underestimating upward momentum real output inflation.
 housing market could recover later year households
 adjust higher interest rates, export demand could pick
 strongly decline dollar overseas recoveries.
 Therefore, think important present time watch
 carefully real economic data coming see whether
 rather benign path possible fact taking place
 whether stronger growth, think likely alternative,
 would indicate rather strong policy moves required.

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, economy sounds good
 gets. start feeling good, thought would
 report something mentioned little
 year--it won't make us feel good--and that's health care.
 four Congressional committees considering health care bill,
 thought would share economics implicit
 legislation. looks like direction
 moving kind subsidy moderate income families.
 think it, that's natural path applaud.
 catch subsidy phased family income
 rises, different imposing tax, least terms
 side effects. numbers involved impressive. CBO
 scored Clinton plan family worth $7,000. So, say
 phase $7,000 subsidy range $20,000 something
 like that; 35 percent marginal tax rate. chances
 something generous pass. So, scaled back
 Clinton plan 30 percent 1994 cost $4,800.
 family, numbers much line Senator Cooper
 proposed Senator Moynihan got Committee.
 family three, health care bill would add 27 percent

 marginal tax rate. top 15 percent federal income tax, 7.65
 percent social security FICA taxes, state local income taxes,
 plus phaseout earned income tax credit, single mother
 supporting two kids would 75.7 percent marginal tax rate
 bracket income $14,000 $34,000. know
 staff's model doesn't take marginal tax rates account directly,
 even 75 percent ones, would seem serious
 effects, especially me. larger families, phasedown range
 wider effects modest. Assuming earned income
 tax credit already phased out, families four earning
 $20,000 $50,000 would marginal tax rates around 49
 percent. situation great bulk
 moderate-income America facing marginal tax rates 50 75
 percent. that's moderate health care bill! speculated

 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, comfortable

 questions primarily two related areas. It's clear

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. expansion
 appears continuing, question pace,
 seem struggling question whether below,
 at, capacity. supply side, much slack left
 labor product markets? Even good historical
 measurements aggregate capacity slack, wonder extent
 could use estimate future. area labor
 markets, felt uncertainty around table usual.
 staff estimate current quarter 6.3 percent unemployment
 current rate 6 percent, Mike Prell suggested
 uncomfortably close analytically blind point.
 thought gave pretty good description concerns
 labor market information. number folks reestimating NAIRU, announced values they're coming
 vary lot. think experiencing significantly
 different labor conditions different parts country.
 least me, that's one explanations
 much uncertainty. raises questions labor mobility
 regions perhaps labor mobility respect certain
 professions. hearing certainly spot labor shortages,
 couple areas mentioned. think re-engineering
 talked last several months may changing
 equation causing bit churning. somebody
 job, may well looking better job. think
 fogging numbers somewhat.
 price side, consistent story, seems me,
 pressures basic commodities,
 competition constraining final goods prices. even story
 may hold long capacity utilization continues
 strained. me, it's hard ignore sustained price
 increases 1994 many basic commodities. Certainly,
 ways deal price increases commodities continue

 period time, that's going problem. demand

 spending, question whether overshoot,
 achieve, undershoot elusive soft landing.
 haven't heard quite much discussion financial
 markets today; maybe everybody exhausted exchange rate
 discussion. think markets survived significant
 turmoil beginning Fed tightening February.
 tightening, markets hit international uncertainties,
 foreign exchange crises, domestic political crises. overall,
 market performance, think, quite good.
 major U.S. casualties; money moved; gridlock.

 market capacity improvements safety nets put
 place last couple years seem worked. Bank
 internal risk management models appear worked.
 contraction exposure fairly orderly gone
 significant market moves. Bank credit expanded. think

 stock market certainly
 year moved sideways last three months.
 may still volatility concerns bond market,
 although less likely cause political concerns
 bond markets affect individuals less directly.
 sum, Ed Boehne called transition period
 whenever change business cycle, likely get
 fair amount conflicting data mixed views. since seem
 usual amount conflicting data opinions,
 going assume found turning point. best,
 soft landing maybe good gets Larry
 Lindsey mentioned. key point make mistake
 end much inflation recession. think
 tough part going hold gains made
 inflation and, fact, make progress toward achieving
 price stability. Unfortunately, think going get
 tougher, tightening point on. may well
 going onto slick pavement travel forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. know,
 wasn't tightening started, trying imagine,
 February 4th, would wished July.
 think would wished almost exactly gotten

 dollar down, obviously, think would expected
 certainly wished run-up long rates less
 been. terms evolution real spending signs
 inflation, think today very, close
 would wished back February--which say better
 anyone reasonably hoped for, wishes don't usually
 come true. judge risks pretty balanced current
 policy, Bob Forrestal said; would add something that: "and
 small."
 It's hard put much probability
 scenario large overshoot capacity. it's hard
 
 7/5-6/94

 put much weight scenario economy's growth rate-never mind recession--going growth 1 percent 1-1/2

 Let say record right thing
 unlucky come terrible shape.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 right thing turn
 
 right.
 MR. BLINDER. right thing turn
 right, way looks now. staff's forecast looks
 correct me, given tightening monetary policy
 that's assumed forecast. call attention something
 felt much Mike Prell pointed himself, 3-1/2
 percent growth rate quarter ended predicated
 good numbers coming haven't seen yet. Mike characterized
 stretch, looks like stretch me; might get it,
 look like stretch. staff's 2.2 percent real growth
 forecast 1995 weaker Committee consensus; think,
 given additional 100 basis point fed funds rate increase presumed
 forecast, it's unreasonable. would point that,
 given lags monetary policy, expect tightening
 carry 1996, would say me--the forecast horizon
 ends fourth quarter 1995--that may see slower growth
 rate 2.2 percent, perhaps slower growth rate 2 percent,
 1996 assumed policy another 100 basis point increase
 short rates sympathetic movement long rates,
 zero change long rates. want talk
 talk policy tomorrow. me, 2 percent growth starting
 late 1995 1996 looks bit low side, believe
 fairly balanced right now, I'll come back that.
 wanted raise one question. Susan number
 others talked lot capacity. Mike Prell quite right,
 think, say light's little bit extent pressures
 capacity right now. listened reports twelve
 Districts, echo less Beigebook, thought
 fewer reports tight labor markets one would expect
 sitting exactly natural rate right now. think anecdotes
 consistent view have, lot, little bit
 go and, course, never know sure.
 vein, capacity utilization: think want remember
 investment boom length magnitude
 still having, likely industrial
 capacity actually picking

 us, that's prerogative, us get make

 projections goals. make projection think
 inflation rate "x" think "x" unacceptable.
 doesn't mean say "x" unacceptable, therefore change
 it. goal projection two fundamentally different things.
 don't make distinction request projections.
 merely ask individual members projecting. thinking

 fine; it's fine sense seems working.

 MR. BLINDER. thing cycle let run;
 that's one part answer. little surprised
 actually hasn't crossed zero 1999, it's going cross zero
 actually get, think, fairly exciting numbers side
 cycles back again. main point
 really shouldn't surprise. Larry, described
 happened 1988-89. interval extra jobs overshot
 natural rate; inflation rate rose almost exactly 1
 percentage point. Committee reacted that,
 recession, that's pay cost. You're looking

 MR. LINDSEY. extended 2006 2008
 something like that, believe think would actually

 MR. BLINDER. think would probably cross year

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, fact base case

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. want make one response
 Governor Blinder. true inflation rate went 4
 percent, responded. believed MPS model
 linearities long-term implications tradeoffs,
 basically would said, well, 4 percent acceptable. That's
 found, looking MPS model 1989 simulating 4
 percent type inflation rates existed using nominal add
 factors, case could made type policy
 initiated tighten weak. model
 
 effectively using policy instrument coincide this.
 think one things learning forced fit
 linear models structures don't stay stable long enough get

 adjust that. sure here, least
 1988-1989. It's though irrational sense 4
 percent inflation sinful inappropriate society

 moved thought inflation truly undermining
 fundamental growth stability economic system.
 could inferred then, would wager, running
 projections MPS model. fact, remember them. looked
 ones tolerated mildly higher inflation,
 impression Larry did. know, not,
 believe it. question we? don't want speak
 Committee, listening way thing evolved years,
 would say there's great skepticism respect
 type linearity. guess MPS model isn't simple.
 It's complex, sophisticated--the best econometric model
 ever seen. world far complex that, think
 tough task trying figure play
 world, always things insist shouldn't doing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. want comment

 Parry, question?
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -46-
 
 MR. PARRY. Yes, somewhat different question.
 want ask earlier comment made
 preference changing ranges except perhaps debt
 range 1995. think we're well aware problems terms
 significance growth aggregates. read
 Bluebook, certainly associated alternative baseline
 forecast, feel unacceptable outcome one goes
 next millennium. Would talk briefly whether
 think, leave targets alone, would
 constraining follow baseline? would say
 targets sufficiently broad uncertainties
 sufficiently great could still confident could
 follow path inflation would get higher would begin
 come down?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think respect M2 M3
 deviations different versions P*
 correctly abandoned aggregates, hopefully come
 back useful. come back useful, would assume
 M2 would go back zero trend velocity, essentially would
 suggest 1 5 percent want

 essentially leave alone wait M2 come back

 distinct trying chase it.
 question raising, however,
 sure debt aggregate irrelevant stage.
 I've raised issue before. can't prove don't know
 prove fact. would say
 many, many episodes American history where, data
 then, would shown unemployment rate NAIRU

 worthy least thinking one important element here.
 is, much credit actually made available
 credit aggregates may working. hypothesis raises sorts
 problems including derivatives affect this.
 unsure credit aggregates question. don't feel strongly
 bringing range down, something, that's
 think could do.
 MR. PARRY. follow-up question: seems
 testimony could make point made M2
 M3, saying that, velocity returns normal, ranges would
 consistent long-term objectives regard inflation.
 could make similar argument regard debt, indicating
 change range made make consistent
 long-term objectives inflation. would certainly find
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -47-
 
 preferable saying range changed technical reasons
 expect debt growth come lower.
 think
 critical difference two interpretations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 agree that.
 
 Tom Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, thank you. two comments.
 First, debt aggregate, tend agree suggestion
 bringing range down. Bob Parry saying, lower debt range
 would make consistent monetary figures.

 could done, described, without raising issues
 things read it-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 sleeping dog alone?
 
 want leave so-called
 
 MR. HOENIG. option, yes.
 second thing
 want comment on, though, reference 1996
 projections. much agree there. is, think,
 unwise us presenting specific projections 1996
 often looked goals also lead presumption
 know really able predict 1996.
 it, would well served long run
 suggested, making general statements 1996 outlook
 committing us specific numbers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. two comments.
 first whether change debt range.

 strong feeling good thing likelihood
 would take life far greater reason
 have. recall, Mr. Chairman, presented
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, included concept real fed
 funds rate one variety things look at.
 press
 reacted new "North Star" policy,
 never intended be.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's good point.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think change debt range
 would almost certainly fate.
 Secondly, briefly
 pet theory problems inflation, tend think--and
 job economic policy economic results--in
 terms economic effects inflation. inflation also
 socio-political effects.
 traditional economic view
 increase inflation transfers wealth lenders borrowers;
 think probably valid. whole segment
 society, live inner cities, don't borrow
 practical purposes. think increase inflation makes lot
 worse, since lot already seriously bad, risks
 sufficient social imbalance society would react
 heavy allocation resources solve problem.
 lead serious economic difficulties, ought think
 decide feel overall effects
 inflation. very, hard put economic model.
 think day come back general discussion
 
 -48-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 really feel inflation, ought try crank
 reality, others agree one, considerations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must say objection made
 respect debt range goes point, think
 probably right. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. going ask whether time
 talk 1995 1996 projections, separate
 go-around later?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let us hold that.
 Unfortunately, discussion gone astray, let us see
 get questions way, hopefully go back formally
 agenda. President Keehn.
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, agree comments
 regard M2 M3. point debt aggregate Bill raised
 made comment going make, really wonder
 correlation period time debt
 aggregate output, prices, like.
 reasonable correlation?
 MR. KOHN. very, good started target
 it!
 [Laughter]
 nominal GDP/debt ratio fluctuated around fairly
 constant level early '80s, explosion
 debt '80s. last years, debt come back much
 line nominal GDP, projection, Mike showed
 chart yesterday, remain line.
 guarantee, obviously; it's hard see natural force
 necessarily keeping debt line. fluctuate closely
 nominal GDP many, many years, leveraging phenomenon
 '80s.
 MR. KEEHN. Hearing that, seems Bill's comment
 particularly appropriate. focusing attention this,
 creating something could awkward long run.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 becoming convinced.
 
 Governor
 
 Blinder.
 MR. BLINDER. Let address two questions
 raised, Mr. Chairman. moving range debt aggregate,
 don't feel strongly that. feel mildly receptive toward
 "let sleeping dogs lie" philosophy. it's something feel
 strongly about; one make case way.
 want raise possibility bit
 forthcoming 1996 projections seems consensus,
 least based heard around table far. One
 things Federal Reserve gets accused
 looking accuse things overly mysterious
 secretive. things secret, course. kinds
 numbers speaking 1996 projections
 much line consensus; would put us right
 Administration is, right CBO is, right central
 tendency private-sector forecasters is. much agree
 qualify it, fudge it, make sure viewed
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -49-
 
 projections, goals. couldn't agree more.
 broadening ranges, kind prose goes around
 it, think interests might well served saying little
 think economy going slightly longer run.
 second reason is, know always stress,
 monetary policy needs focused longer horizon six
 quarters. think one us around table would say
 couldn't make monetary policy closed eyes going
 happen quarters 7, 8, 9, 10. us ideas
 what's going happen quarters, quite
 important want monetary policy today--probably
 lot important think going happen next
 two quarters fact. So, terms clarifying
 thoughts broader public watching us closely
 terms meeting little bit--this small step--the request
 openness, think least something said
 going public, speak, projections.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let ask this. numbers,
 could make sure conceived forecasts, benign,
 releasing would set precedent, would
 continued future. going occasions would
 suspect judgment Committee economic forecasters,
 professionals, would forecast rising unemployment rate
 unwelcome development, wonder would handle
 point. argue it's forecast, response
 Federal Reserve prevent happening.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 may capability
 
 so.
 MR. BLINDER. think that's perfectly good question.
 think it's likely--it wouldn't necessarily always happen--that
 event forecasting rise unemployment coming
 two years, would probably easing monetary policy; possibly
 wouldn't.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 maybe not.
 
 Yes, maybe not.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't disagree that.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. I'd like comment couple
 issues discussing. First respect
 ranges, agree entirely ought leave M2 M3
 alone--I assume included M3 M2. don't think, given
 uncertainty surrounding aggregates, there's purpose
 served lowering ranges point. don't think
 perception among public even people Congress longer
 ranges really reflect expectations policy
 going be. respect debt, don't feel strongly
 this, reason change debt range, don't know
 wouldn't it. persuaded argument
 focus much attention it. all, ranges,
 presumably flexibility change time time.
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -50-
 
 good reason so, don't see shouldn't
 let markets make determination whether
 giving debt aggregate undue attention. It's quite different
 respect monetary aggregates don't think
 good reason change them. think desirable change
 debt range, think probably go ahead it.
 respect Senator Riegle's request, must say
 want identify comments made
 Governor Blinder. seem lot gained
 little forthcoming information. clearly
 runs risks; there's question that. think
 basically risks forecasting 1995. could
 position, example, given year forecasting
 unemployment rate going up. Congress could focus that,
 could give us problems. Clearly, going 1996
 presents uncertainty, think benefits
 probably greater risks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Incidentally, President Jordan, hoped
 would get back track, afraid policy
 discussion; you're on.
 MR. JORDAN. principle, would favor publishing
 information inflation objectives 1998.
 forecast higher inflation going produce, again,
 favor even publishing 1995. think mistake
 Committee put numbers saying expect inflation
 rate go context think appropriate
 monetary policy--one result higher inflation 1995
 1994. central tendency forecasts also 1995
 unemployment currently. So, rising
 inflation rising unemployment 1995, let alone 1996. don't
 think ought putting kinds numbers. pleased
 1994 forecasts Committee collectively
 thought going February inflation
 unemployment. on, see things getting worse
 respects. don't see would want announce that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, assuming want views
 would ranges issues;
 mode. would reaffirm existing ranges 1994 would
 set ranges 1995. would willing adjust debt
 aggregate. think could deal uncertainties
 might raise, don't feel strongly it. basic rationale
 would one expressed--the long-run benchmark concept
 respect M2 growth normal velocity consistency
 range long-term price stability.
 Now, said that, come
 discussions had, don't think target ranges communicate
 anything respect long-run intentions. really
 issue Senator Riegle raising.
 uncertainty velocity treating
 aggregates, quite appropriately think. view
 good deal uncertainty intentions would
 
 -51-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 two things would cite. One survey, think might
 discussed Board briefing, long-run inflation
 expectations respect G-7 countries. somewhat
 dismayed see United States ranked among high inflation G-7
 countries, along Italy United Kingdom. average
 inflation expectations United States survey 3.6
 percent 10 years, four countries considerably
 lower. So, would one piece evidence mind
 confusion respect say committed
 long-term price stability yet survey--I don't know
 reliable was--that creates sort result.
 uncertainty intentions much
 current context relates developments since last meeting.
 think actions last meeting created quite favorable
 responses financial markets, particularly long-term fixed income
 markets. actions initially considerable credibility.
 look going broadly since then, it's
 quite disconcerting terms people think
 intentions. effect, private-sector forecasters
 ratcheting inflation expectations 1996.
 additional anecdotal information respect rising
 prices perhaps labor shortages there. Yet, FOMC
 said last action substantially removed
 degree monetary accommodation prevailed 1993.
 emerged meantime perception breathed big
 sigh relief, moved rates 125 basis points maybe gotten
 best neutral, going rest oars
 developments going would lead higher
 inflation expectations ultimately higher inflation. effect,
 viewed said, think, 3 percent somewhat
 higher inflation good enough far concerned.
 Now, understand hasn't said done
 Committee longer run right thing.
 significant costs, think, sorts perceptions,
 particularly terms longer-term rates. Recognizing
 aggregate ranges communicate anything intentions
 confusion marketplace perhaps elsewhere
 respect intentions are, view would it's
 time us much explicit long-run
 intentions respect inflation range indicate
 practical matter would probably take us achieve
 objective. anything response Senator
 Riegle's request, would sort nominal GDP target
 one could derive implicit inflation target. think
 respond all, ought responding. don't
 make explicit statement FOMC testimony respect
 long-run expectations inflation goes beyond "we think price
 stability good," get specific terms target range,
 least think make clear
 consider 3 percent inflation unacceptable willing
 accept it. Obviously, back actions,
 going talk later. really think cost
 things unfolded here.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -52-
 
 MR. STERN. regard ranges monetary
 aggregates, certainly agree suggest leaving
 are, including debt variable. don't see much
 gained fooling around right reasons
 cited.
 regard question Senator Riegle's request,
 would inclined provide information notion
 information better less, also troubled
 fact somebody might look think goals.
 Obviously, would want emphasize projections
 forecasts goals, people could interpret
 differently. Presumably weren't responding variable
 set looked unfavorable Congress, say, would good
 reason reasons weren't. would explain event
 policy was. So, troubled
 questions might come whether forecast
 acceptable us responding it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, aggregates first,
 right seem hear lot people are. 1994,
 would change them. don't believe changing targets
 matter budgets midstream unless there's very,
 compelling reason so, certainly don't see here.
 vein 1995, would think signal prospective change
 would require clear reason
 pretty firm intention want early next year,
 don't see now. may well change ranges get
 there, six months experience facts
 time start period
 forecasting. see reason call shot far ahead.
 regard release 1996 forecast, narrow
 margin think would undesirable. Many reasons
 cited so--primarily along line
 openness--are quite significant important, don't feel
 negative came morning. still
 think going very, difficult keep people
 ascribing goal forecast instead simply viewing
 forecast soft one that. afraid would
 leave implication try possibly cause
 forecast materialize. Obviously, would over-promising
 monetary policy deliver. also fear related thought
 process part interested people would set whole new type
 speculation markets play with, enough already.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, would agree proposal
 change M2 M3 ranges. don't feel strongly debt
 issue, guess, balance, would favor reducing
 sort grounds setting M2 target now.
 Since debt tracks nominal GDP least long run,
 probably case trying make range fit longer-run
 monetary growth objectives little closely. current range
 midpoint 6 percent, probably bit high.
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -53-
 
 lowered it, would become consistent rationale hear
 giving M2 range.
 far 1996 concerned, good bit sympathy
 things Governor Blinder Bob Forrestal said,
 really Tom Melzer's camp that. preference would
 look opportunity make longer-term goals
 explicit respect prices tie bit.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. would leave unchanged ranges M2
 M3 1994 1995. Again, think change would imply
 know exaggerate importance. aggregates
 performing properly, would already set appropriately
 sustainable growth, don't see case moving them.
 respect debt, go along change range, although
 don't feel strongly it. Like Bob Forrestal, think
 believe good reason it, ought go ahead
 change it, 5 percent seems better center point range.
 respect 1996 forecasts, agree disclosure
 better. also think going disclose more,
 ought disclose better things, sure
 numbers 1996 would necessarily provide better information. So,
 I'd prefer description direction even goals. know
 sit projections look 21/2 years out, don't think numbers 1996 represent
 quality disclosure; it's quantity quality. So, think
 would better description.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. would retain M2 M3 targets 1994
 would keep 1995. think ought declare
 victory ranges M2 M3.
 consistent want longer term.
 don't think skillful enough forecasting factor
 shifts demand either M2 M3, think
 essentially ought aggregates going forward.
 debt, came meeting without strong feelings. still
 don't strong feelings, although think margin
 something said lowering range 1995. I'd leave
 alone 1994, think lower debt range would
 consistent ranges M2 M3 time. don't think
 it's equivalent reference "real" federal funds rate.
 took life people interpreted
 justification tightening. doubt much whether
 Committee going tighten lower debt range 4-8
 percent 3-7 percent, don't think come anywhere
 near taking life. don't feel strongly.
 reason, balance think reason it,
 would change range 1995.
 releasing projections 1996, awfully hard
 recall instance Committee request
 information initial reaction it. always
 long list reasons; sometimes valid think sometimes
 
 -54-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 it's habit. problem goals versus projections;
 bad news problem; quality/quantity issue.

 go 18 months go 30 months, don't think
 substance it's much different.
 think elevate importance
 1996 projection giving give it,
 inclination would give 1996.
 would couch usual
 articulate way say essentially doesn't mean much--you
 way saying nicely.
 [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you, think.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 [Laughter]
 
 MR. PARRY. aggregates, would leave M2 M3
 targets current ranges reasons
 mentioned. preference lowering debt range
 1995, since think good reason believe
 consistent ranges set.
 also don't think
 would result excessive focus markets it's clearly
 understood change made. Riegle request, don't
 strong views, balance think releasing 1996
 forecasts probably would cause problems create misinformation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, would prefer leave
 three ranges rather change them.
 don't see
 great advantage lowering debt range, may indeed
 create something would find awkward deal future
 people attached importance do. don't see
 significant probability debt growth going outside
 existing range 1995, think better part valor might
 leave range is.
 regard Riegle request, ask myself:
 July
 1992, would forecast economy look like July
 1994? can't believe real accuracy
 forecast far out. run danger able
 forecast accurately explain later
 far didn't anything it.
 If, example,
 forecast says one thing conventional wisdom ought
 something different, something
 make forecast different. forecast always going
 interpreted however someone wants interpret they've got us
 carpet.
 attractive forecast,
 assumed goal, unattractive forecast,
 assumed admission failure. think
 asking trouble get something dicey. doubt
 much models playing would
 accurately forecast July 1992 today. So,
 think it's dangerous get kind thing numerical form
 front public.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, would leave M2 M3 alone.
 believe would inclined reduce debt aggregate, say
 reason make consistent monetary aggregates
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -55-
 
 recent flows, make big deal it. agree
 say it's kind concept real fed funds
 rate, doubt would noticed remarked upon. would
 hope rhetoric goes aggregates would write
 moribund help keep alive return
 future handy have. It's lot easier
 talk monetary policy trying hold
 previously determined target range seem
 raising interest rates. would hope would discuss flows
 depository institutions stock bond funds
 remind people aggregates done well recently.
 would prefer keep alive concept modifying M2 least
 verbally M2 adjusted bond funds, stock funds forth,
 maybe even go far anticipated growth range
 adjusted M2.
 don't know think releasing projections
 1996. seems good options. need
 forthcoming can. basically agree Jerry Jordan
 going release them, probably ought redo them.
 going treated targets. going blamed
 projecting bad things anything it. So,
 least, think ought redo release them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 First Vice President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. One problems end
 list people called people say good
 stuff! also agreement discussion Ms; would
 leave way are. agree comments, whoever made
 them, taken us long time get ranges
 reasonable expression long-run policy think stay
 period time. attracted idea
 reducing debt range marginally suggested alternative II.
 issue releasing projections 1996,
 sympathy President Boehne said, attracted
 idea don't know much developments 18 months
 future therefore may much greater problem
 releasing data don't know much about.
 weighing everything balance, think attracted
 argument release explicit forecasts going
 far, set expectations may end tying hands rather
 allowing us flexibility future. would go middle
 alternative myself, giving specific hard numbers trying
 explain factors weigh terms looking longer
 run. would much favor balanced discussion inflation,
 unemployment--those sorts things. Maybe sounds like Mom
 apple pie, don't know share specific targets
 regard long-run rates inflation forth.
 little concerned putting something says
 goal Committee. would concerned coming
 reasonably balanced side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. M2 M3, don't bother changing them.
 Changing debt aggregate range isn't going make much difference,
 
 -56-
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 think probably lower think it's proxy
 nominal GDP.
 forecasting, think John LaWare good point.
 remember happened staff CEA
 1982. December 1982, deep recession make
 forecast five years out. Marty Feldstein, sort
 baseline, said let's guess 4 percent year, starting second
 quarter 1983. dart thrown dartboard. turned
 1987 real GDP forecast fact 1987 total
 $3 billion, close bull's eye ever seen
 anyone make. meantime, first criticized wildly
 optimistic, criticized wildly pessimistic
 economy went forecast. anyone crazy
 make kind forecast even turns right!
 [Laughter]
 Nobody ever remembers right. least,
 think Jerry Jordan's point correct, going
 interpreted somehow wish list. us put numbers
 unemployment inflation rising invite attack. It's
 worse forecasting 4 percent growth five years.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. earlier comments, didn't remark
 forecast 1996. would opposed going forward far
 unless really to. seems awfully far
 forecasting horizon, far prefer state expectations
 terms long-run objectives.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. favor alternative
 across board 1994 1995. Perhaps, living city
 financial journalists swarm, convinced that,
 leaving M2 M3 alone changing debt ratio, would
 much discussion meaningfulness move anybody
 Committee really thinks meaningful.
 regards 1996, find awkward position
 trapped middle Alan Blinder's syllogism. believe
 major. agree open disclosure,
 concern present time forecasting 1996 unrelated
 fact year divisible four, may
 interest behind request. ever forecast far out,
 would better considerably discussion
 thinking possible now. tactical matter, prefer
 release forecast 1996. Perhaps meet February
 get prepared February, may want think fully
 whether wish forecast longer period. suspect
 answer would "no," partly Larry Lindsey
 said. may well need somewhat
 forthcoming mean price stability. don't
 conclusion that, think it's probably debate may
 wish have.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. go further, Governor Kelley,
 failed put position debt issue.

 MR. KELLEY. would leave debt range unchanged now,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. get formal vote, let
 see voting on. It's pretty clear
 consensus leave M2 M3 ranges unchanged.
 two issues really interesting. seems
 marginal inclination go lower debt range--most voting
 members favor that. Riegle request gets turned down,
 general view best forthcoming.
 sense Humphrey-Hawkins essentially sets
 monetary aggregates signal could objectively evaluated
 Congress respect doing. meaning

 noting Humphrey-Hawkins text without putting numbers
 per se would enable us associate forecasts
 still talk broader questions think goals
 Committee without putting specific numbers down.
 hesitate think would happen, Cathy Minehan said,
 interpretation forecasts.
 So, leaving aside actual formulation this,
 consensus Committee seems leave M2 M3 alone,
 marginally favor bringing debt aggregate
 range hopefully get consequence "real" interest
 rates type discussion. suspect probably much
 risk bringing debt range; don't think it's big deal.
 Look, credit really starts move, might important
 signal us respond to. So, sure wrong,
 itself, put up; separate

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree

 believe way help reserve currency manage domestic
 monetary policy appropriately stabilizing and, longer term,
 bringing inflation rate. believe move would
 make sense domestic policy, 25 50 basis points, would
 deemed effort strengthen dollar, would fail.
 Therefore, could well put us kind market instability
 would require sharp increase interest rates, something
 would completely inappropriate domestic economy.

 stated yesterday, believe economy could conceivably
 moving path bring us sustainable growth
 decreasing, worst short-run stable, inflation rate.
 However, think risks forecast high
 side, is, economy fact stronger that.
 Since quite close capacity indicated virtually
 statements yesterday, stronger economy would almost certainly
 bring increased inflationary pressures.
 Therefore, seems
 definite bias toward tightening, says
 think it's entirely

 possible, incoming data give us better feel what's

 Ordinarily, prefer

 don't think really choice that. think precedent
 set would difficult avoid
 announcement particular meeting. think something
 go out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, agree "B" reasons
 indicated. However, strongly, avidly asymmetry.
 reasons twofold. First all, look four moves
 date year, efficient ones regard move
 long rate relative move short rate May
 March, moved meeting. fact, bond market
 rallies moved meeting. next least efficient
 February, first move, moved meeting.
 inefficient, one actually bond market
 selloff, April surprise move--a surprise sense
 taken announced FOMC meeting. don't think
 market likes surprises; think moving meetings buy us
 nothing; cost us something long end market.
 Second, question comes data move.
 don't think want move employment reports (a) reason
 Jerry Jordan mentioned (b) reasons gave.
 commented inefficient unclear employment report
 
 7/5-6/94
 
 -71-
 
 data are; lousy respect. don't know
 interpret move release. regard
 moving price number, agree Jerry Jordan's
 assessment that, even though would tend concerned,
 would want wait probably two bad numbers drew
 certain conclusions. example, stated past
 homeownership component could move suddenly would bias
 number. cannot imagine single number would cause want
 move meetings, given inefficient results seen
 date past four moves. reason given
 is--your phrase was--to maintain notion marketplace. Well,
 fact, marketplace isn't going know anything
 next meeting over. given that, based current
 expectations, probably going move August meeting--and
 agree analysis completely--I see absolutely nothing
 gained quite bit lost, intermeeting move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. ask Kohn--I don't disagree

 Greenbook think it's fair say great majority
 private forecasters telling us need raise short-term
 interest rates maintain current inflation picture.

 need make another fairly strong move toward restraint,
 guess see reason wait. seems sooner better
 later, think good case made increasing funds
 rate 1/2 point morning, quite apart particular focus
 dollar. estimate would near-term expected inflation
 rates somewhere 3 3-1/2 percent. would mean
 moved nominal funds rate 4-3/4 percent meeting,
 would moved real funds rate 0 1-1/2 percent

 later on. minimum, think raise rate 1/4 point
 today understanding would raise promptly
 incoming information indicates need that. don't like 1/4
 point increases generally, think current situation
 increase would better none. still sure
 know asymmetric directive is, think favor
 circumstances.
 far announcement concerned, agree need
 make sort announcement morning. little

 whether going continue moderate sustainable level,
 whether going get closer potential.

 So, think best course monetary policy moment

 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, came meeting favor
 alternative B bias toward tightening. think made
 strong case choice, certainly support that. Even so,
 would slightly favor symmetric language, think
 asymmetric policy inappropriate stance--I think next move
 likely toward tightening--but sure
 asymmetric language really buys us. side
 coin, bad experiences, seems me,
 asymmetric language. May last year comes mind context.
 So, long good sense want
 policy, think really need operate. Therefore,
 prefer symmetric language, don't feel strongly it.
 terms announcement, bit dilemma, choice
 Ed Boehne suggests seems good way dealing
 particular problem.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. support suggestion, Mr. Chairman,
 "B" asymmetric. far announcement goes, like Ed Boehne's
 suggestion also. would like add don't think it's
 desirable tie knots trying define
 asymmetry. It's necessary us achieve precision there.
 me, it's broad indication bias, leaning,

 MR. STERN. moment pretty comfortable
 well way see things unfolding. would
 favor alternative B symmetric directive, usual
 preference. said that, think need careful here,

 talk--Al Broaddus touched this--to effect moved

 reading historical record suggests neither large

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. think alternative B,
 nothing right now, prudent course. game
 fine-tuning, forced get close
 capacity, always danger oversteering. think
 mindful that. see risks, think Bob Forrestal Ed
 Boehne said, fairly balanced, need know little
 much slower gear economy going right now.
 Since last FOMC meeting, interest rates tad; money growth
 rates down; reserves falling three months so;
 economy giving feeling slowdown. It's also
 case fiscal policy, hasn't mentioned, moving
 maximum contractionary phase first half 1994,
 works lag, although quite long lag monetary policy.
 Even though think risks quite balanced now,
 believe would useful go asymmetric order cock gun,

 thing wanted say this: mentioned

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Alan, forgot comment announcement.
 agree announcing something. guess wondering whether,
