 questions Peter?
 
 MR. BLINDER. one, Peter; it's sort two parts,
 part question. Markets tend latch
 things faddish ways. Something almost implicit
 said, want see want make explicit--it's
 fad dollar/yen dances U.S./Japan trade talks
 events, is, monthly announcements trade figures
 talks. almost implicit said market
 seems getting fad. mean say that?
 second part related looming date, September 30th.
 MR. FISHER. think market faddish; I'll agree
 that. think opportunity market
 less anxious trade talks. I'm school interpreting
 market's reaction trade talk announcements believes
 market biased reactions. announcements tend
 explicit, mundane, mechanical, however strongly articulated, e.g.
 "we imposing 60-day deadline," foreign exchange market,
 dollar/yen, shake fairly easily. harder
 interpret happens announcements come setting
 context overall Japan/U.S. relationship overall
 economic relationship including exchange rates trade flows
 stake, that's argued that's
 announcement made. tends undermine
 confidence dollar/yen confidence Administration
 would stick stronger dollar rhetoric. think
 nuance market really quick picking on, whether
 announcements couched broad overall relationship
 whether couched specifics trade announcement
 hand. think reflection, end July announcement
 U.S. side seen mechanical context. market reacted
 negatively actually Japanese announcement would walk
 away September 30th sanctions imposed. Now,
 announcement fell probably thinnest foreign exchange

 MR. PRELL. think probably cited one period
 could find 1980s, I'd reexamine record.
 I'm sure precedent one would look for:

 anticipating forecast moderation economic expansion

 Nationally, seems us economy still quite

 real consumer spending, all, follows three consecutive quarters
 robust growth consumer outlays; seems clear now,
 Mike Prell said, least weakness reflects supply
 constraints, especially respect domestic automobiles.
 Moreover, latest reports consumer sentiment suggest
 consumers backing big way. Mike said,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. I'd like pick two nits Greenbook.
 One small nit, one big nits go, guess.
 [Laughter]
 Still, think nit sense basic outlook
 Greenbook, subject qualification I'll come to, seems right.
 first, really nit, inventories,
 especially retail inventories. think hazard--although
 I'm somewhat reassured comments heard around
 table, especially Cleveland--that retail part
 inventory buildup potentially dangerous. Perhaps overstated;
 cause concern panic. don't think it's going
 snap back huge way, let read two phrases
 capture mean. one Greenbook, page 4
 says "there evidence inventory overhang time."
 one DRI report came two days ago
 says: "the sharp inventory accumulation goods second
 quarter creates inventory overhang."
 It's much
 illustration one organization knows lot other,
 although guess put chips one table, I'd bet
 Mike Prell Roger Brinner.
 meant illustrate
 reasonable people look data different views.
 decompose inventory buildup last three months, March
 June, 60 percent retail level Board's
 adjusted current cost basis, happens way handout
 reached two days ago; could computed another way
 
 8/16/94
 
 -24-
 
 well. number $42 billion annual rate compared
 average three previous quarters $14 billion, $42
 billion biggest number long time. see number
 big quite weak sales growth--negative overall retail sales
 period 0.3 percent average per month take
 autos, special case--and inventory/sales ratios
 creeping down, I'm little less sanguine Greenbook
 amount forward momentum near term. Now,
 said, it's big deal.
 I'm talking qualitative
 change outlook, quantitative change, potentially
 negative direction.
 much bigger nit pick came second paragraph
 first page Greenbook says "labor capital
 resources currently appear quite fully employed."
 would
 preferred say "not quite fully employed, though close,"
 picked

 words carefully, "not quite fully employed, surely close."
 unfortunately one points time even though know
 don't know things precision cannot fine-tune
 economy, make decision close
 capacity; little doubt that.
 matters,
 context, whether close side close
 side, even though hard tell difference. view
 Greenbook--"quite fully employed"--colors lot comes
 next. reflected particular NAIRU estimate,
 Greenbook forecast implicitly, new measure, 6.3 6.2
 percent, something like that.
 could subtract .2 percent
 change measurement, Board staff's current estimate
 elusive number number keeps shrinking.
 remember BLS thought would .6 percent back January.
 think reasonable people couldn't rule zero point, .2
 percent seems reasonable estimate right based know.
 take .2 percent off, convert old basis,
 way think way econometric evidence speaks,
 translates old basis NAIRU 6.1 6.0 percent implicit
 Greenbook forecast. me, high end
 reasonable range. don't want say unreasonable estimate;
 reasonable estimate definitely high end.
 reading evidence better estimate NAIRU

 old basis would something closer 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 percent.
 repeat again, kinds discrepancies matter
 really close NAIRU. year half ago, didn't much
 matter numbers thought accurate.
 I'd
 like say don't think 6.3 percent unemployment
 FOMC's aspiration level. strong feeling ought
 shooting lower unemployment rate that. lower
 unemployment rate last three months,
 incidentally. said, colors Greenbook
 because, commensurately that, average growth rate
 next five quarters, last quarter year
 1995, 2.1 2.2 percent Greenbook forecast--which,
 again, would thought slower would really like
 produce. slow think actually small
 overshoot need nudge economy back down, 2.1
 2.2 percent nice small amount lower than, say, 2-1/2 percent
 would nudge economy little. feeling
 quite appropriate policy given think NAIRU is.
 
 -25-
 
 8/16/94
 
 However, sense "fundamental" difference,
 characterized big nit.
 Greenbook forecast unreasonable given
 staff assumptions monetary policy January, is,

 another 100 basis points funds rate built forecast.
 looked econometric models, Board's others, say
 100 basis points good for, given normal historic
 reaction long rates short rates. Now, think Mike
 mentioned, first 125 basis points much
 normal reaction long rates short rates.
 think us hope,
 least us believe, good chance
 next ratcheting short rates get less normal
 reaction. taking normal historical reaction, 100 basis
 points tightening fed funds would, year,
 knock .7 percent GDP, two years 1-1/3 percent.
 growth rates, something range .6 .7 per year
 next two years would taken amount tightening.
 add back 2.1, you're playing number
 looks like 2.7 2.8 percent current policy, seems quite
 reasonable. So, think staff forecast consistent
 policy built in, I've already indicated think produces
 growth slow. going say slow taste,
 say slow economy's best interests.
 think-and I'm taking Greenbook six weeks ago,
 remember quite explicit implicit
 Greenbook--that comes literal, taste
 literal, interpretation wanting let inflation accelerate.
 don't want let inflation accelerate. doesn't necessarily
 mean stand 10 20 basis point increase
 inflation, especially given unwinding variety factors
 including speed effect Mike mentioned. look
 core CPI numbers Greenbook, 3.1 percent 1993--this
 fourth-to-fourth--3.1 percent 1994, 3.1 percent 1995.

 quite literal holding line exactly are,
 staff estimate would take 100 basis points
 fed funds rate that.
 don't think interpret
 quite literally that, reason think
 aspiring bit higher growth Greenbook.

 note forecast unit labor costs still low. Even
 1995 never gets much 2 percent,
 big deterrent.
 regard, even though bullish forecast

 take quite much official action: macro results
 funds rate 5-1/4 percent whereas Greenbook, know,
 funds rate 5-1/2 percent. CPI 2.9 percent
 Greenbook 3.0 percent. looking forecasts
 myself, I'm somewhat optimistic either Greenbook
 staff, think difference largely really

 actions. continue right things, perhaps even
 including today, stage going become apparent
 practitioners economy, think pretty
 good shot that. true, although numbers would

 respect issue close economy
 potential, confess uncertainty here. Nevertheless, basis
 econometric anecdotal evidence, seems output
 yet passed potential, although approaching it. don't
 yet see strong enough indications tightness labor markets,
 enough signs increasing wage pressure, sufficient indication
 pickup growth unit labor costs conclude
 ventured beyond potential. Capacity utilization high historical
 standards, investment also adding capacity rapid rate.
 see scattered evidence lengthening lags filling orders.
 balance, I'd say sense economy could stay

 inclines toward feeling

 inventory/sales ratios become significantly limited and,
 consequence that, process going zero change means boom

 Unquestionably important concern whether

 imported goods accounted roughly 1/3 inventory change

 notion 50 basis points because, like you, think 25 basis points
 really going desired effect, it's going
 cause uncertainty markets. also pleased Board
 considering discount rate increase think combined
 policy actions desirable effects. So, I'm completely
 supportive suggesting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, I, too, agree policy

 appropriate action take. also agree 25 basis

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. enthusiastically support proposal, Mr.
 Chairman--all various elements it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. also enthusiastically support complete

 chances inflation accelerating significantly next year beyond
 great move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, came favoring alternative coupled
 least increase 50 basis points discount rate.
 I, too, support recommended. couple comments
 aggressively move, though seems support
 recommendation:
 think contain emerging inflationary
 pressures demonstrate resolve respect price
 stability long run, move aggressively now. share
 concerns potential "the shoe dropping"
 syndrome respect 25 basis points. think,
 people said earlier, temporizing makes job tougher
 later. respect credibility, think evidence
 financial markets ways go really
 credibility respect longer-run inflation intentions.
 respect statement, concern would raise
 hope take account drafting make sure
 incorporate said tying hands. really can't
 know today could transpire, flexibility
 evaluate incoming data move necessary. financial
 markets really concluded basically "out lunch"
 rest year, could set motion speculative forces
 actually accelerate need move again. it's got done
 carefully; trust judgment that, tricky.

 MS. MINEHAN. much add think
 shared sense risk right now, mostly
 side, need deal risk. agree
 tightening necessary. would go 50 basis points;
 would follow discount rate increase. getting
 area nuances here. think belief nuance side
 little closer Governor Blinder's perhaps President
 Melzer's, whatever nuances statement, ought
 form sort wait see anything
 necessary--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let read suggestion hopefully
 captures involved nobody blindsided this.
 potential statement would read: "The Federal Reserve continue
 monitor economic financial developments gauge
 appropriate stance policy. actions expected
 sufficient least time meet objective sustained
 noninflationary growth."
 good crafting think
 done capture trying yet tie
 hands, tying hands would terrible mistake,
 don't think it's credible event.

 favor wording.
