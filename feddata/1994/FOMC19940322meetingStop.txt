 MR. TRUMAN. subject permanent enlargement
 Mexican swap line. hope background material circulated
 reasonably comprehensive comprehensible that,
 therefore, brief. explained, two themes
 discussion. One Mexicans' desire substantial
 permanent enlargement current swap lines Federal
 Reserve System United States Treasury; lines $700
 million $300 million respectively. second United
 States Treasury's desire responsive Mexican
 request also set consultative mechanism macro policy
 issues among three NAFTA countries, makes certain amount
 sense.
 Specifically, proposed put place,
 thought would occur sometime second half April, would
 consultative mechanism among three NAFTA central banks
 finance ministries announced increase swap lines.
 thought United States Treasury
 System increase combined lines either $5 billion $6
 billion, though think preference $6 billion. new
 swap lines would divided half half System
 Treasury. Activation lines, course, would require consent
 case moment. normally consent would
 linked satisfaction economic policies
 reasonable agreements repayment. Indeed, it's contemplated
 drawings would collateralized.
 contemplated would parallel, though somewhat smaller,
 increase Bank Canada's swap line Bank Mexico,
 though size decided. thought would
 staff meetings Mexicans Canadians
 next month would refine proposal would come back
 FOMC action, probably telegram. action needed
 today, felt discussion would helpful.
 know, Mexico principal user swap network
 past decade so. size actual swap drawings often
 augmented special arrangements. change swap line
 point would clearly linked NAFTA shift
 Mexico, first April, autonomous central bank.
 not, emphasize, linked way recent pressures
 peso. would glad answer questions.
 
 3/22/94
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. two questions, Ted. First,
 proposal contingent way Canada's moving? Second,
 conditions, example collateral consultative apparatus,
 unique arrangement swap agreements
 well?
 MR. TRUMAN. question Canada, think it's
 required Canadians come point. actually
 swap line now. Whether agree amount
 Treasury thinking about, C$1 billion C$2 billion
 size Mexicans thinking of, told C$3
 billion, think another matter.
 
 far conditions concerned, swap lines
 least implicitly condition terms Committee
 satisfied drawing would supported economic policies
 drawing country. So, sense it's same, I'll
 come back minute. collateral, normally
 don't language effect actual swap line
 agreement. reason case Treasury
 past quite elaborate conditions swap line
 Mexico arrangements relating outstanding swap
 lines. suggestion, inclination anyhow, would essentially
 leave swap line way is, except say amount X
 would raised Y. would rely provisions Treasury's
 agreement conditions. think that's cleaner way
 things. So, principle could be,
 past, activation one line without activation other.
 activation took place, one could decide conditions
 warranted. years--both Mexico
 countries distant past--always wanted make sure
 country going draw, assurance
 would able repay us one source another. details
 conditions specified advance varied depending
 circumstances.
 MR. FORRESTAL. take conditions
 satisfactory Mexican authorities?
 MR. TRUMAN. assume so. haven't full set
 discussions, can't say certainty.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. First, small item clarification.
 memorandum say Canada's line would increased
 C$1 billion C$2 billion, already C$2 billion
 assume-MR. TRUMAN. No, Canada's line Mexico would increased
 current C$250 million C$1 billion C$2 billion.
 MR. JORDAN.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 line Canada.
 
 Okay.
 hasn't proposed yet increase swap
 
 3/22/94
 
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 Canada?
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. JORDAN. regard Mexico, mixed
 feelings. one hand, trouble swap lines,
 utilization, conditions. I'm still satisfied
 mind appropriate use swap lines per
 se. respect reason treat Mexico
 second class partner versus countries; major
 trading partner assume spirit NAFTA
 sense bringing big leagues. Now, whether really
 ought level Germans Japanese I'm
 sure. hand, look utilization
 swap lines Mexico past, it's troubling pattern.
 tends occur six-year intervals, including 1976, 1982, 1988-very questionable utilizations. it's 1994 would predict
 this, line going get used going
 trouble saying no. might get used supplement even
 don't approve permanent increase going
 serious questions appropriate use facility
 kind political environment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. didn't question, comment
 that's appropriate now. lot sympathy Jerry
 said. think Ted presented number plausible reasons
 enlarging swap. think memo distributed
 helpful showed facility used constructively
 number occasions past. drawings generally
 paid back promptly U.S. taxpayers lost anything.
 So, kind perspective think make case
 increasing line.
 seems number broader issues
 Jerry alluded urgently need attention. 1951
 Treasury/Federal Reserve Accord established principle Fed
 needs meaningfully independent within government order
 conduct monetary policy effectively. think know
 independence indispensable going able
 discharge fundamental responsibilities successfully. also know
 independence granted grudgingly it's
 constant scrutiny Congress elsewhere. Consequently,
 think ought reluctant take action might
 even appearance abusing independence lest lose
 it.
 Now, mind, enlarging swap line
 Mexico worries great deal. understand it, line
 initially established back 1967 help deal balance
 payments issues specifically help support then-fixed
 exchange rate peso dollar. rationale
 longer exists; fact, materials Ted distributed make
 explicit facility would used purpose. So,
 seems clear loan Mexico current
 circumstances essence would fiscal action U.S.
 government. fiscal actions--expenditures government--are
 
 3/22/94
 
 supposed authorized Congress Congress supposed
 appropriate funds. So, whatever general merits may
 making loans Mexico, don't think involved without
 explicit Congressional authorization, Mr. Chairman. So, would
 oppose increase swap line.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I'd also like make comment.
 think one functions Federal Reserve seek
 monetary stability broader framework American
 economy obvious interlinkages world markets,
 heard morning Peter's Joan's presentations.
 think great deal created swap lines
 major trading partners United States countries
 past important part world's interlinked
 financial system. Mexico, much better performance
 last twelve years, reached stage economic
 performance seems justify included major partner
 United States participants world economy.
 also country, border, serious financial
 instability would definite possibility spreading across
 border creating problems markets.
 appropriate swap line used times market instability,
 may may related years
 presidential election, long careful used
 prop value Mexican peso fundamentals say
 would inappropriate. think it's consistent
 general responsibilities. So, don't share view
 something inconsistent role central bank
 therefore would demand approved funding Congress. think
 it's much part responsibilities Federal
 Reserve swap line Germany is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, must admit support
 recommendation. concerns most, however, potential use,
 concern related Jerry's. recall paragraph Maroni
 memo referring fact 1988 swap line used
 window-dressing operations enhance announcement
 country's reserves scheduled made Director General
 Bank Mexico August 4 President Mexico September 1.
 think swap lines used deal disorderly markets.
 think someone wants could make case perhaps
 used political purposes. kindest light one could put
 used prevent occurrence disorderly
 markets, view I'm uncomfortable well. It's
 much authority bothers me; it's potential view
 misuse Mexican swap.
 MR. TRUMAN. argument time obviously
 announcing drop reserves would cause problems
 financial markets reason went along
 request.
 
 3/22/94
 
 MR. PARRY. Hasn't tradition use swaps
 deal disorderly markets also use prevent
 disorderly markets?
 MR. TRUMAN. think used purposes.
 times involved, so-called windowdressing operations. 1980s. 1982
 period driven slightly different set considerations
 domestic currency cover concerns. think
 right question--and would put way around--whether
 central banks

 think it's fair say, however, central banks
 days though tend use mechanisms window-dress
 reserves rather central bank swap lines. could argue
 use central bank swap lines, ultimately becomes public,
 done
 seems much forthcoming
 manage reserves essentially past 20 years

 MR. PARRY. Mexican swap lines used 1976,
 1982, 1988 well. political aspect seems apparent.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, occasions
 drawn Mexican presidential election years.
 true last three election years.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, admit ambivalence
 toward this. think use swaps, memos
 imply, influence exchange rate levels risky business.
 agree Bill McDonough used stabilize markets.
 question size proposed increase.
 material rationale number shooting toward now,
 $6 billion total, wasn't clear perhaps
 economies larger. larger number it's
 necessarily right number particular reason.
 fair interpretation?
 MR. TRUMAN. That's fair interpretation. $5 billion
 number number fact Mexicans put forward year ago
 approached us done rough back-of-the-envelope
 calculation increase swap lines since swap network
 first established. One come numbers various
 countries lot different ways it's fair say
 largest increase trade since 1967 Mexico,
 globally bilaterally. That's $5 billion number came
 from; $6 billion number came fact
 number contemplated providing last November context
 NAFTA. that's source two figures. Neither based
 fine scientific analysis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 First Vice President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. question comment. Ted,
 accurate say Mexico country since early
 '80s actually draw swap lines?
 
 3/22/94
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. conditions impose Mexico
 sense involve treating like second-class citizen;
 conditions really operative present
 terms swap lines.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, went way past.
 recent drawing early '80s Sweden.
 asked questions time, long
 drawing going outstanding, conditions were,
 would contemplate repaying it. sense asked
 questions Mexican case.
 MS. MINEHAN. would generally agree President
 McDonough legitimate function central banks
 general. would concerned, whatever extent enter
 swap agreement Mexico, businesslike basis
 us. regard I'd little nervous relying
 Treasury's collateral. I'm also bothered, people been,
 history drawings amount money seems
 go one source funds another source funds pay
 back. would concerned didn't take measures
 terms substantial expansion line
 Mexico drawn upon would independent
 means securing exposure.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, maybe clear this.
 suggesting, matter convenience,
 would rely Treasury Treasury could put

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 would contemplate ever

 say, "Well, yes, approve long make
 collateral arrangements." That's would contemplate rather
 pre-specifying conditions. we'll either way.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. would support proposal. think heard
 Al Broaddus saying since line wouldn't used peg

 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 consequences approving
 
 request?
 MR. TRUMAN. don't know certain; that's
 discussion, may put way. weight
 opinion Committee going ahead request,
 think would inform Mexicans Treasury advance
 didn't embarrass us themselves--particularly themselves--by
 announcing something couldn't deliver on.
 think consequences would Treasury would go
 ahead enlarge arrangement, presumably substantially.
 Whether would go way $6 billion leave us $700
 million, don't know. something like might happen.
 would affect extent, think, relations
 Mexico United States Treasury point.
 wouldn't end world.
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, two issues. One
 wisdom swaps general well they've used.
 question whether Mexico ought treated differently.
 $6 billion line trade flows various economic
 ways measuring things. really it's second issue
 whether Mexico treated differently; think
 really talking wisdom overall swap arrangements
 today. specific question is--and don't think really
 answered question, Ted--what consequences treating
 Mexico differently? consequences nonapproval? I'm
 clear mind consequences are. don't come
 discussions intervention foreign exchange markets
 swaps ideological baggage. want know
 practical implications actions lack action.
 MR. TRUMAN. I'm sorry didn't answer question. I'm

 sure mean say "treat Mexico differently."
 mean turning request, number
 countries years whose requests, either join swap
 network enlarge existing swap lines turned down.
 nonapproval request would unprecedented
 standpoint, though cases countries turned
 discouraged gone far process.
 would obviously adverse implications least short

 irrelevant regard Bank entering new

 MR. BOEHNE.
 $6 billion?
 
 consequences something less
 
 MR. TRUMAN. It's doable I'm sure it's worth arguing
 about, may put way.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let add point here.
 Treasury approached us, toned good deal; set
 lot road blocks periods wanted move.
 capability restraining actions think Committee,
 included, feels uncomfortable with. decide want
 disengage, lose whatever power area
 influence system, pluses minuses it.
 Obviously, can't acquiescence system inappropriate.
 interesting tradeoff here, think
 aware of, one asks consequences are. think one
 consequences pull away set
 policies area would find less agreeable. would
 worse country. might better Federal Reserve;
 that's possibility. think keep mind. I'm
 saying anytime somebody comes one proposals
 dive in. feel increasingly uncomfortable
 inclinations, frankly, similar much heard.
 lot riding whole thing comes out. say
 no, pluses minuses might add.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 bigger show?
 
 really price admission
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's partial price, would say.
 never position Treasury essentially
 thwarting something feel strongly. Basically
 Secretary Bentsen, think, feels strongly this;
 ardent supporter NAFTA. belief American interests

 America's international trade position NAFTA-type agreement

 limit. I'm saying merely Treasury says
 fact done Treasury probably mind
 put hands up, think would acquiescing
 loose policy. One second, Bob Parry first.
 MR. PARRY. certainly would favor disengagement
 don't problems numbers proposed.
 feasible agreement among Treasury, Mexico, us--and
 matter others swap arrangements--that
 swaps would used deal disorderly markets? would feel
 much comfortable.
 
 -10-
 
 3/22/94
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, let make two points. Treasury
 certainly agrees want get engaged using swap
 line peg exchange rate. That's point number one. Therefore,
 circumstances, dealing essentially pressures
 exchange rate, President McTeer explained, exist even
 crawling peg floating exchange rate. drew
 swap lines late 1970s operating floating
 exchange rates intervening. Presumably
 discussions, including ongoing discussions associated
 consultative mechanism, designed surprise ourselves,
 speak, things come up. question window-dressing
 itself, think fair say it's little difficult-particularly speaking outsider--to bind future
 members FOMC. think would perfectly appropriate,
 based upon discussion, convey Mexicans staff
 level talks going next weeks
 extreme reluctance use swap line window-dressing
 purposes. And, therefore, since come ask
 permission begin with, know advance that's
 even harder sell, may put way, dealing
 garden variety disorderly markets.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 That's helpful me.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. guess I'm somewhat confused
 comments around table seem address different parts
 issue. discussing merits swaps, period?
 discussing merits swap line Mexico? discussing
 request increase swap line Mexico?
 discussing use swap Mexico? above?
 sounds like me. seems
 discussion may long overdue whole array
 arrangements place various countries, perhaps
 trying delineate define better standards
 engaging swaps. That's point number one. point number two
 insuring swap arrangement meets criteria.
 certainly great trouble use swap
 either pegging exchange rates window-dressing purposes.
 think that's inappropriate. hand, seems
 Mexico has, within certain limits, handled previous drawings quite
 responsibly even though may question purpose
 one two them. handled responsibly terms
 meeting conditions swap, right
 impression. So, going focus use swap line,
 accepting swaps appropriate certain cases, maybe
 need define regard acceptable use
 swap. heard things don't think acceptable.
 acceptable use swap address disorderly
 markets? question, guess, rather general
 statement confusion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. continue Governor LaWare's train

 asking vote; he's asking guidance.
 much sympathy Chairman said role

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry, quick question?
 
 MR. PARRY. Yes, point clarification. quite
 correct it's sometimes difficult define disorderly
 market, everybody would agree give authorities
 judgment issue. issue whether authorities
 attempt prevent might turn disorderly
 market versus dealing disorderly market.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Sure. brief response:
 think honest people could differ moving toward
 certain going become disorderly market
 
 3/22/94

 quickly--for example, central bank involved knew
 reserves really moving out. we'd decide
 whether use swap line appropriate. wouldn't want
 fight market defend artificial exchange rate. might
 inclined least entertain request drawing swap

 well answer "no."
 MR. PARRY.
 
 hope so.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. since disorderly markets

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, much profound

 realize. really gets issue Vice Chairman raising
 earlier type institution want be. sensed
 whole philosophical debate discussion
 process going dealing issue supervision
 regulation consolidated bank regulatory system. think one
 make strong argument central bank narrow
 institution basically maintains strictly central banking
 operations. narrow sense, it's obvious
 would involved swaps it's obvious would
 involved currency intervention. would restrict
 strictly domestic monetary policy--and gets
 issue--with add-on functions like supervision
 regulation like.
 question really stance

 get involved issues many aspects Treasury's
 lead. want influence want affect them, it's
 obvious try that, indeed doing,

 hate give up. think force good.
 decided pull horns, think would disservice
 nation. fully recognize concerns
 expressed today, I'm uncomfortable you. unlike
 Ed Boehne, carry intellectual baggage discussion. I'm
 afraid views like Presidents Jordan Broaddus
 anything else, recognize issues
 involved. Anyway, President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, simply going say going
 forward need keep mind tradeoff
 good somewhat broader function independence.
 think always need front us.
 point Committee need take fundamental look

 basic philosophical issues. problem
 current proposal it's difficult disentangle proposal
 broader issues. now, it's going
 somewhat difficult subsequently, early date, look
 broader issues current proposal takes us particular
 path. bothers me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. questions mind largely
 answered remarks Bill's remarks before,
 putting matter broader context. think remarks
 extremely important. reason way conduct
 year regard issue that's viewed gets
 scrutinized others could tell us lot whether
 desirable thing do. need know accepted
 Capitol Hill, Treasury, others subsequently.
 One comment I'd careful going
 far linkage timing developments.
 think NAFTA wonderful development, I'm sure everybody else
 does, Mexicans going April 1st think
 terrific. wouldn't want link closely
 don't know whether Costa Rica Chile next
 line when. say joining free trade agreement
 broadening participation sort thing means soon
 make central bank independent join swap club
 message want there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, general supportive
 comments, exact concerns
 colleagues have. two points came discussion
 troubled me. first use phrase "this Treasury."
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Well, read morning's paper correctly,
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 see paper
 
 morning?
 MR. LINDSEY. Apparently talk
 Washington wire one columns he's going
 
 -14-
 
 3/22/94
 
 Mr. Altman successor, Mr. Rubin be.
 part it. malicious gossip?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's
 
 That's U.S. news.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. That's U.S. news. nothing
 point except want make certain clear
 minds making deal "this Treasury," "this
 Secretary Treasury," "this Deputy Secretary Treasury,"
 "this anything." cloud judgment
 bed Treasuries Secretaries
 Treasury well.
 Parallel phrase unmentioned
 "this Mexican government," much like "this Treasury"
 except much volatile "this Treasury."
 "This
 Mexican government" may well replaced don't know
 replacement going be.
 jump board
 warm legitimate feelings toward "this Treasury" "this
 Mexican government" ought realize that's really
 signing with.
 question had--this actually question rather
 statement speech whatever--is say "no"?
 I've felt reassured double bullet two page 3
 memo drawings Federal Reserve swap line would
 continue require agreement FOMC. assume, therefore,
 unstable market conditions occur Chairman would
 call conference call would discuss vote
 needed. correct?
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, although depends circumstances;
 yes principle. past that's things happened
 would expect matter Chairman that's things would
 done.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Well, Chairman us long
 
 time.
 MR. TRUMAN. always perfect this,
 past efforts made staff, particularly case
 Mexico Mexican swap line actively used
 others, keep Committee informed developments
 try anticipate possible requests. discussions
 consultations Committee approaches
 us. Maybe shouldn't mention it, recently released
 transcripts included conference call October 1988
 special swap arrangement end never implemented,
 discussed extensively Committee time.
 would presume that's way things would happen future.
 MR. LINDSEY. Well, think real question ask
 hard think would real live circumstances us
 say "no"? Say, example, coming two weeks
 Mexican election legitimate run peso--a
 
 3/22/94
 
 -15-
 
 disorderly market looks someone else going win
 whatever. real live case. It's hard separate
 politics economics. disorderly market,
 could FOMC easily say "no"?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, think would difficult say "no"
 came us, past, asked special
 arrangement, too. Obviously, would confront slightly different
 situation $6 billion--in case $3 billion--swap line
 us; may slightly difficult say "no" actual
 drawing would set special arrangement.
 say "no." 1982, example, said "no" repeatedly.
 dealing set circumstances quite different
 one would hope see today near future.
 repeatedly said "no." allow window-dressing
 operations, part strategy set get
 position would go International Monetary Fund
 would change policies.
 
 think Committee
 Chairman Committee would make decisions
 came them. sense, you'd make
 decisions anyhow. can't disengage Mexico; think that's
 point President McTeer made basically. Mexico there,
 going deal central bank problems
 regardless, neighbors share largely
 space.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer. hope
 last word running time.
 MR. MCTEER. fairly narrow question. says
 considering substantial enlargement Federal Reserve

 MR. MCTEER. Along lines Larry getting at, think
 it's reassuring dealing central bank rather

 Questions either gentleman?
 
 MR. JORDAN. attended first meeting Committee
 two years ago March meeting. two years I've
 tracking migration staff forecasts nominal real GDP,
 prices, meeting meeting. first meeting
 March 1992, projections 1993 staff
 time lower inflation forecast 1995.
 started getting forecasts inflation 1994 August 1993
 March 1994 forecasts 1994 current
 forecasts 1995. look forecast
 1995 trend inflation years revising upward
 worries me. it's causal, maybe ought leave Committee
 forecasts go back again!
 trying understand make assumptions
 policy go putting together forecasts, Mike, you've
 said past try read Committee saying
 thinking regard objective, order try ascertain
 policy consistent achieving objective. went back
 last year's Greenbooks review comments regard
 inflation, caused something
 missing Greenbook. Beginning March 1993
 Greenbook's statements regard inflation follows: "we
 expect slow forecast period;" May 1993,
 "resumption disinflationary progress;" June, "lead
 disinflation;" August, "tempering inflation expectations
 downward pressure wages price inflation;" September,
 "disinflation trends reemerged;" November, "further progress
 reducing core inflation;" December, "progress toward price
 stability;" January 1994, "movement time toward price
 stability." None type phrase appeared one.
 fact one, pointedly thought, shifted instead "holding
 track consistent containment inflationary pressures."
 deliberate, significant shift, maybe new reading
 Committee objectives?
 MR. PRELL. Well, noted, think provided
 baseline apply objectives. said,
 accepted structure forecast didn't accept
 implied result inflation, would logically lead say
 monetary policy assumption made wasn't sufficiently stringent.
 strategy applied, think could plausibly read
 forecasts made statements
 enunciated members Committee suggesting would
 given something useful put in, terms
 analysis, tighter monetary policy therefore somewhat slower
 growth lower inflation result next two years.

 alternative perhaps comparable many

 hard say people thinking today.

 happened basically made mistakes. Sometimes made
 mistakes, sense, policy assumptions; Committee didn't
 anticipated. would admit, too,
 upside growth surprises time. perhaps even
 important, certain junctures didn't anticipate much
 unemployment would decline given amount growth.
 find today think less slack might
 anticipated earlier forecasts less downward pressure
 inflation rate. anticipating, without sharp
 constraint aggregate demand, we'll get low 2 percent
 inflation range within next year so. perhaps
 complicated answer, you've raised whole bunch questions.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. I'd like ask question unemployment
 don't think related excellent memo deals

 answer Jerry. Looking unemployment rate amount
 slack implied labor markets, looks though either
 new Okun's Law relationship relative previous forecasts
 kind intercept change resulted observing
 first quarter's unemployment rate is. Real growth, compare
 two forecasts, less prior forecast
 unemployment rate also fair amount less.
 intercept change conclusion Okun's Law operating
 different way?
 MR. PRELL. think you've put finger
 significant question and, wrestled
 longer, perhaps might come different conclusion. You've
 highlighted key point, taken seriously
 view happened recently--I mean drop
 unemployment--not seeing clear evidence fluke.

 MR. PARRY. Well, extent NAIRU doesn't

 MR. PRELL. Well, things equal, held

 finely, would enough slack, presumably, give us modest

 MR. BOEHNE. tenor Third District's economy
 changed last several months. Economic growth resembles

 Manufacturing clearly strong District, much

 expectations seem positive remainder year.
 New orders up; steel auto production schedules strong.
 One major railroader told company running flat

 soft Philadelphia, become strong suburbs,
 noticeable improvement south Jersey. would say strength
 coming sooner us thought. One major real
 estate firms told hiring additional commercial real
 estate agents long ago laying
 didn't expect hiring back time.
 sufficient demand warrant new commercial construction
 suburbs starting, would say, within next year two.
 retail sales, autos big ticket items
 selling well. still note caution smaller
 retailers smaller items. clearly hurt weather.
 feeling sales pick up, natural
 worry expenses continuing haven't

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, terms District,
 question underlying level economic activity
 remains strong. despite miserable weather
 Midwest sectors, obvious exception housing
 construction, come very, well.
 little add already know
 automotive sector. second-quarter production schedules
 set preliminarily 9 percent last year. increase
 would even greater except manufacturers
 dealing capacity constraints better selling
 models. Still, production increase second quarter
 less first quarter, Mike pointed out. Therefore,
 automotive industry's contribution second-quarter GDP
 lower case first quarter. capacity issue
 automotive industry, though, interesting shift
 industry years experiencing plant shutdowns
 layoffs. cases, struggling keep
 consumer demand, course particularly case light
 trucks. address problem Chrysler, example, announced
 $1.8 billion capital investment program. told it's
 likely program larger get
 it. Given Chrysler last 10 15
 years, seems almost incredible industry's
 star profit performer. must say auto industry,

 Retail sales remained strong side.

 Despite strong level economic activity
 don't sense price pressures quite heavy might
 expected. Major companies, particularly buy

 continuing get results this. Labor contracts continue
 restrained, wage increases easily dealt
 productivity improvements, continue impressive.
 said that, clearly signs many cases prices
 least stabilized showing slight upticks.
 That's particularly true, course, steel-related products.
 prices manufacturing sector may firming,
 increases offset moderations service sector.
 think, net, outlook inflation continues constructive

 regard national economy, forecast

 perhaps numbers come higher current expectation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. District, certainly seen
 significant weakening business conditions recently, aside
 temporary setbacks seem clearly related
 weather. Business basically good across sectors think
 it's fair say people contact with,
 directors others, reasonably optimistic prospects
 remainder year. overall picture generally
 pretty good won't belabor that.
 contrast comments heard,
 think major, striking development region

 inflation generally. see directors' meetings;
 hear contacts.

 favorable news inflation front region others

 respect national picture, let make
 couple comments staff projections analysis.
 mainly two points. First, trouble downward
 revision projected real GDP. Projected real GDP growth
 first half reduced Greenbook annual rate
 3.5 percent 2.8 percent, year whole 3 percent
 2.7 percent. significant reductions. recognize
 reductions predicated extent rapid
 tightening policy assumed earlier
 projections. feeling still likely get
 something like 3 percent growth year whole.
 especially struck, Mike, projections consumer spending,
 think projected growth rate first quarter
 2-1/2 percent something like 2-1/4 percent year
 whole. don't see happening. calculated correctly,
 even don't get change real consumer spending February
 March, would still rate growth first quarter
 3.6 percent annual rate.
 Second, probably fundamentally,
 concerns Greenbook's discussion recent behavior
 long-term interest rates interpretation movement.
 last five months, 30-year bond rate risen 120
 basis points, corresponding increases long rates.
 That's one largest movements long rates brief
 period since end 1981-82 recession. view strongly
 suggests inflation expectations risen
 marginal amount. think interpretation widely shared
 financial market participants, evidenced comments reported
 press market newsletters. Greenbook,
 contrast, least sections Part seems dismiss
 least de-emphasize inflation expectations interpretation
 recent backup long rates. seems offer two alternative
 scenarios. first rise rates may reflect, least
 part, higher actual expected real short-term rates
 road stronger economy reaction action
 back early February. least last six weeks
 since took policy action, long- intermediate-term
 rates risen significantly short rates. guess
 
 3/22/94
 
 -24-
 
 would imply explanation expected real short rates way
 road increased, think it's unlikely
 economic news policy developments increased expected real
 short rates 20 30 years future. don't think
 explanation account great deal significant backup
 longest maturity rates. second explanation, understand
 correctly, rise bond rates may little
 economic fundamentals inflation expectations may
 resulted primarily instead what, lack better term, I'd
 refer irrational market behavior--some kind bandwagon
 effect overshooting use term think used. may
 well true; wouldn't deny that. it's hard argument get
 arms around it's really psychological argument
 economic argument. seems risky me, put mildly,
 dismiss de-emphasize least possibility reason
 one biggest backups long rates long time
 inflation expectations worsening expectations.
 event, think question interpret move
 bond rates one need give weight get
 policy discussion later meeting.
 MR. PRELL. Chairman Greenspan, could inject couple
 points clarification here?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. PRELL. One, it's worth, level GDP
 forecast last. currently
 estimated, got growth fourth quarter
 anticipated and, essence, lower growth rates simply offset
 surprise. second point one arithmetic consumption

 know sure happened January February point.

 MR. BROADDUS.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. retail sales revisions January

 February/March arithmetic. that's key explanation
 seemingly low number have. interest
 rate story, think touch upon various elements
 thinking, went step describing happened,
 covering things didn't say explicitly Greenbook.
 referred 120 basis point rise long rates since October.
 guess basically find hard believe circumstances
 changed way raise intermediate- long-term inflation
 expectations anything approaching 120 basis points. don't find
 evidence surveys kind movement; don't see
 evidence asset prices really suggests big
 move. don't rule all--I suggested think
 comments--the distinct likelihood elevation inflation
 concerns play role recent backup rates, particularly
 since early February. Basically said that, given
 expectations kind news coming forth
 next several months, allaying concerns,
 
 3/22/94
 
 -25-
 
 thus part backing rates due reduction
 inflation expectations.
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, that's fair. point addressing
 particularly Greenbook distinct said
 morning--I think emphasis little different--is
 statement saying "we inclined think emergence
 large inflation premium per se explain relatively little
 That's struck read
 recent surprise bond yields."
 Greenbook that's really addressing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, information received
 Twelfth District's economy since last meeting suggests
 economy strengthened, although would point California's
 economy continues lag. District outside California
 experiencing strong growth. District employment growth outside
 California 4.1 percent January 1993 January 1994.
 Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona ranked top five states
 employment growth last year, strength states
 widespread absent mining industry.
 Construction strong outside California, double-digit
 construction employment growth states. Moreover, strong
 permits nonresidential awards suggest activity continue
 months ahead.
 California continues show mixed signals. Payroll
 employment declined February. Employment 1.2
 percent past year since July 1990 644,000.
 appears real estate conditions improving somewhat.
 Residential sales California 20 percent January
 level year ago, could something weather.
 Contacts also report multiple offers housing many parts
 state. commercial real estate picture improving,
 stabilizing rents slight declines vacancy rates reported.
 prominent forecasters people follow
 California. One UCLA one Salomon Brothers.
 recently revised upward forecasts state,
 predicting economic recovery begin second half
 year primarily result improved picture regard real
 estate also infusion earthquake relief funds.
 Turning national economy, agree Greenbook
 forecast far GDP concerned, averaging approximately
 2-1/2 percent year next. It's worth emphasizing,
 course, forecast assumes rise short-term rates
 current levels. strong growth saw last half
 year eliminated gap actual potential GDP,
 mentioned Mike Prell, brought unemployment close
 estimates natural rate. growth projected
 year would seem likely eliminate gap might remain.
 seems, Ed Boehne others said,
 downside risks forecast conceivably could
 upside risks. Greenbook financial markets presume
 significant increase short-term interest rates year but, even
 come about, wouldn't expect see progress

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MS. MINEHAN. Well, somewhat less bullish report

 continuing strong performance District
 national economy well reinforce concerns inflation
 outlook. past five months consumer producer prices
 accelerated pace previous five months.
 Producer prices finished goods, example, increased 1.6
 percent annual rate since September 1993 following 2.7 percent rate
 decrease previous five months. Consumer prices
 accelerated 1.8 percent 2.7 percent rate
 period. addition, that's mentioned industrial production
 employment trends earlier, think potential bottlenecks
 price pressures growing. Capacity utilization reached
 level recorded previous cyclical peak July 1990, labor
 market conditions adjusted recent changes survey methods
 rapidly approaching degree tightness existed time
 well.
 surprisingly, think inflationary expectations also
 increased, reflected 25 basis point upward shift
 yield curve following last meeting. top 50 basis
 point steepening already occurred October, long
 rates touched lows, February meeting. One final note
 score would question:
 significant increase
 inflationary expectations plausible price levels declining
 recently last year? answer would be, "you bet."

 look postwar period, essentially nine periods
 declining inflation. four quarters following nine
 periods, average increase inflation rates fourquarter periods 2.2 percentage points. it's
 implausible, given what's going now, significantly
 higher expectations respect inflation.

 Mike used earlier remarks containing inflation,

 strong view, reflected around
 table, solid economic outlook. Indeed, I'm hard pressed
 remember outlook looked unequivocally expansionary
 today. always able find reasons it's going
 cave, lots different figures adduce.
 real danger economic outlook, see right now,
 financial structure. that, think Vice Chairman said,
 low probability inducing downturn. financial
 system ruptured, would terribly difficult
 bring economy quickly. want precedents that,
 suggest merely go back read business annals go
 back 50 100 years. show economic conditions looking
 absolutely terrific three weeks roof caves in.
 outlook one thing; history think temper it. Nonetheless,
 doubt strong underlying forces
 economy.
 one area, think said February meeting,
 potential upside risks inventory situation, continues
 fairly tight. think lead times probably
 beginning move out. Somebody mentioned steel mill inventories
 picking up; I've heard myself. beginning get
 first signs inventory numbers may moving up,
 
 3/22/94

 that's case, would maintain higher level economic growth
 think otherwise would gotten.
 question cut tail
 probability distribution economic outlook, even though
 modal sense outlook much higher
 six months ago far 1994 concerned. good deal
 concern six months ago economy might fade fast.
 truth matter not. event, even though
 modal expectation hasn't changed, probability distribution
 changed, think that's major factor moved
 bond market whole constellation interest rates.
 thought interesting aspect discussion
 around table today element surprise--and don't know
 phrase involves almost everyone exception
 Al Broaddus. Everyone concerned pickup inflation,
 tightness stringency picking up, fact commodity
 prices moving, apparent acceleration wages
 final goods prices.
 raises interesting issue ought think
 about. don't know leads us, year ago raised
 question absence financial tinder--meaning credit,
 debt, money supply--in economy, even economy
 picking beginning see shrinkage excess
 capacity. year ago, soft inflation excess
 capacity. Looking strictly data show date,
 inflation rate, anything, somewhat less expected.
 detailed data January February, exactly
 probably half-way February. detailed data
 daily spot prices lot things. data
 purchasing managers' reports never terribly useful
 respect inflation. clearly seen pickup
 underlying commodity prices; seen little evidence
 accelerating inflation data final prices. Even
 February CPI, core rate .3 percent, clear
 indicator. I'm inclined pick pieces isolate them,
 .6 percent increase owners' equivalent rent,
 way average. bring average, takes
 another tenth percentage point.
 reason raise question economy
 doesn't look like anything experienced last
 30 years. last 30 years, saw tightening slack
 system, also saw pickup credit demands
 inflation. That, however, universal experience
 country. go back 1920s, several periods
 significant tightness markets significant credit
 expansion inflation; also experience even
 1950s. raise issue pretty far along
 business cycle. inflation showing head little
 more? Now, next set numbers may come I'll sorry
 said this, earlier experience raises question:
 automatically case economy tightening
 inflation takes hold?
 
 3/22/94
 
 -43-
 
 would submit looking simple short-run Phillips
 curve, doing, without credit variable it,
 may misspecifying process question. know,
 shrinkage credit basically reflected balance sheet strain
 latter part 1980s time associated
 extraordinary weakness aggregates. sure,
 pickup credit--in loans debt,
 low levels numbers support, least historically,
 significant inflation pickup. must say find whole
 process puzzling, seem likely
 continue way. I'm sort waiting credit numbers
 really begin move, patterns begin look like
 found familiar, business forecaster number
 decades.
 something different going on. don't know yet
 means, two facts coincide one another
 least raise awareness. One yet
 getting final demand price increases, may well
 getting extraordinary productivity increases keeping unit
 labor costs competitive pressures there. why,
 course, commodity prices, clearly going up, working
 way system direct manner. type
 situation looking credit picture lack
 inflation reminiscent '20s last 30
 years. something ought keep mind,
 basically going presume automatic
 relationship, think least question whether
 true. I'm sure really affects policy
 don't think question point
 manner, accommodative monetary policy central
 bank, credit become excessive become inflationary
 concepts monetary system works
 go radical revision, can't stage even
 remotely contemplate.
 leaves me, putting inflation issue aside
 moment, think restore policy neutrality
 fast can. really mind eliminate
 excess degree accommodation, assume basically feasible.
 dealing strictly economic outlook stands
 now, doubt mind economy could absorb
 large increase interest rates without problem.
 difficulty don't think financial system take
 large increase without break tensile strength--which
 strained significantly last time break. It's
 risk, frankly, think quite concerned about.
 So, issue of, one, moving fast
 two, manner doesn't break markets.
 see objectives here, another characteristic well. One
 elements think observing respect
 markets--and one reasons level
 instability markets--is perceived
 moving basis economic data, markets certain sense
 doing. Now, Jerry Jordan doesn't like
 approach policy considerable sympathy point
 view, give marketplace semblance knowing

 doing. worried don't know
 going move, Sword Damocles hanging
 market. don't know whether going move 2 days, 5
 days, 12 days; basis judge
 understandably nervous. question is, consciously
 purposely tried break bubble upset markets order
 sort break cocoon capital gains speculation,
 position--having done sense succeeded perhaps
 intended--to try restore degree confidence
 System. means find way, possible,
 move toward policy stance perceived
 move short period time.
 essentially leaves us, far see, two
 options: moving funds rate 25 basis points 50 basis points.
 don't think option, incidentally, nothing.
 case feel comfortable nothing,
 would frankly reject "B."
 leaving option aside, think
 interesting choice. 50 basis point increase would move
 funds rate 3-3/4 percent. judgment would
 perceived neutrality ultimately be.
 view eventually 4 4-1/2 percent.
 question whether, when. move 50 basis
 points, think would create far instability realize,
 largely half point enough remove question
 ultimately going. think certain advantage
 25 basis points markets, seen two moves
 row 25 basis points meeting, tend almost surely
 expect next move next meeting--or least
 think probability occurring probably higher 50/50.
 case markets perceive that--and perceive
 going 4 percent midyear, moving meetings--then
 effectively removed Damocles Sword action becomes
 predictable respect timing well respect
 dimension. impression, decide move direction,
 last move might want make--say, example,
 funds rate 3-3/4 percent decided 4-1/4 percent might
 neutrality--is perhaps add 50 basis points
 point. would ring gong end could effect
 withdraw race, provided period rising
 inflationary pressures actually start become real
 distinct prospective.
 So, must say point, struggled
 issue quite long time given considerable thought
 trying convince 50 basis points might best move,
 come thinking 50 basis points good logical
 argument it, it's soon. doesn't quite get us I'm
 sure gains advantages would want.
 inclination stage--I may sound lot surer think
 ought done know markets
 tricky--is 25 basis points today, go asymmetric
 chances lowering rates intermeeting period ought
 zero.
 possibility numbers may turn
 lot stronger projecting--remember Greenbook
 industrial production effectively slowing March. fact,
 
 3/22/94
 
 -45-
 
 weekly data results March point decline, rise,
 also possibility expansion could slow ratify
 Greenbook projection. fact turns case
 get removal significant pressures,
 opportunity maintaining slow pace moving neutral
 policy area program along;
 nothing inflationary pressures. If, however, wholly
 independently process going neutrality, begin see
 economy slowing--or specifically, see
 inventories really beginning move up, that's
 think vulnerability is--then second set
 decisions make. would still path neutrality
 implement, far I'm concerned get to,
 would added factor top that--an additional tightening
 superimposed move neutrality because, effect, would
 seeing economy actually beginning heat up. guess
 going see economy heat funds rate
 gets 4 percent, meaning think enough time move
 meeting meeting, gets us 4 percent federal funds rate
 midyear. think far better position.
 That's way came out. took lot longer discuss
 usual I've thinking longer-productively otherwise, I'm sure. lay seems
 frankly interested counter-arguments
 issues people would like raise, respect
 policy respect pieces. come really
 depends evaluation outlook concerns
 moment economy; economy looks terrific me. I'm
 worried could break back financial system find

 MR. BOEHNE. Well, think case less accommodative
 policy today quite persuasive. press hard monetary
 accelerator get economy moving, economy
 approaches cruising speed ease accelerator avoid
 slam brakes road. real issue--the major
 issue point out, Mr. Chairman--is much move. prefer
 1/2 percentage point increase federal funds rate compared
 1/4 think distance go get neutral
 policy, it's better cover distance earlier rather
 later. Also, think 1/4 point increase small, given
 economy is, set almost immediate speculation
 next move. repeat gone
 recent weeks. think decisive 1/2 point increase
 reduce uncertainty, especially accompanied appropriate
 announcement.
 Now, always risks decisive action. One risk
 might overestimating strength economy,
 less accommodative monetary policy might damp growth much.
 Given underlying strength see, appears
 small risk, best protection kind risk

 stage economic recovery. Historically, waiting long
 adjust rates greater risk, think it's one
 need especially sensitive current environment.
 sensitive financial risks point out, must say
 one form another argument around
 table moving past moved. also
 may point significantly different points
 historically, guess push economy,
 get inflation end growth. one come
 lots arguments, subtle, not. think important thing
 stick basics go heart matter.
 economy telling us need less accommodative
 monetary policy, view ought move direction
 decisively. It's surprising , people things decisively,
 end getting better results try outsmart
 consider angles curve. So, think
 ought go heart matter.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think robust growth real
 GDP recent quarters sharply diminished slack labor
 product markets. growth slow much
 anticipated, could facing significant upward pressures
 inflation. Despite action taken last meeting, real
 federal funds rate still appears be, view, unsustainably low.
 think favor moving toward neutral policy stance
 therefore support significant increase federal funds rate.
 Even neutral stance require real funds rate
 1 percent, would still need large increase nominal rate
 reach level. favor things nominal income
 targeting rules also support significant increase
 federal funds rate. looked various nominal income rules,
 suggest fell behind curve last meeting
 need large increase catch up. finally, financial
 markets appear view expecting significant increases
 interest rates next six months. Thus, feel 50 basis
 point increase needed. increase 25 basis points would
 probably sufficient prevent increase inflation
 certainly would sufficient make progress reducing
 inflation. Therefore, first preference would Bluebook
 alternative C. However, since believe whether things
 today couple weeks later doesn't make much difference
 terms impact economy, certainly could accept 25 basis
 points today asymmetric language side least
 possibility move could come prior next meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Let say agree 100 percent
 Ed Boehne. said well; really reflected position
 completely. couple comments. Again, suggested
 earlier, despite good news current inflation juncture,
 see clear signs inflationary psychology building,
 think that's reflected clearly bond rates.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, think I'm
 modification. definitely want send signal market,
 think two ways that. One,
 option us, go number credible--a round
 number people would say natural rate. One might
 contemplate 75 basis point increase 4 percent. I'm
 recommending that, one could suggest that. would clear
 market participants stopped. Going 3.75 percent
 mind doesn't indicate anything. doesn't suggest going
 stop 4 percent; doesn't suggest going stop
 4-1/4 percent; doesn't suggest going stop 4-1/2
 percent. suggest another increase coming
 road. Since don't think 75 basis point move credible
 don't think 50 basis points sends signal certainty, found
 suggestion 25 basis points probably preferable.
 disagree asymmetric directive great benefit
 move meeting intent probably going
 move next meeting meeting precisely
 remove uncertainty going move odd Thursday
 April, one things spooking market last
 month. So, disagreement want get
 quickly possible, mind move 25 basis points
 now, 25 May 25 July 5th seems pattern get
 us splendid time. one accuse us upsetting
 markets, establish certainty market
 headed fixed point higher think would
 achieve 50 basis points. would vote 25, symmetric.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let respond
 great sympathy point making. Ideally,
 symmetric exactly reasons state. problem

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's true, nobody know

 MR. LINDSEY. know, talking

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let put way. far I'm
 concerned, asymmetry event economy
 inflation begin look much stronger moment
 anticipate. Now, occurs, one possibility
 leave directive symmetric decide go conference call.
 That's another possibility.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 consistent.
 
 would prefer that.
 
 It's internally
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's equivalent, far I'm
 concerned. fact, important period
 expansion think talk other, better
 are. find consultation frankly quite useful. President
 Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. regard early part
 remarks, agree much need think differently
 influences purchasing power money. never
 made sense think growth per se reduces purchasing
 power money. That's really phenomenon last decades,
 got notion demand management,
 increasing trouble way think monetary policy
 fiscal policy influence purchasing power money. course,
 lot problems Phillips curves gap slack type
 models. think individual sectors economy,
 agriculture notable, spontaneous increase
 output--what would call bumper crops economists would call
 exogenous increase--that reduces prices agricultural products.
 That's true, really, sectors economy. Otherwise
 call productivity increase--something can't explain called
 productivity increase. That's nature capitalist system;
 that's would expect happen market economy.
 is, inherent resiliency expand, removing depressing forces,
 mean per se purchasing power money erode
 faster rate.
 view says don't want asymmetry
 possibility asymmetry would trigger action related growth
 would characterize Committee basically liking
 growth. see economy growing fast, therefore going
 react that; lot problem that. thought
 Mike Kelley's remark caution interpreting
 useful; it's worthwhile think that. Mistakes
 
 3/22/94
 
 -49-
 
 made conducting monetary policy. Occasionally, somebody say
 "Oops." know that's going happen; policy mistakes made.
 comes question mistakes find easy
 correct least damaging economy realize
 made mistake. That's similar comments Ed Boehne
 making risks are. assume economy
 satisfactory path now, gliding path toward notion
 capacity inflation accelerating later find
 wrong, costly thing correct. Whereas
 assume stayed easy long need move
 quickly get ideal neutral policy stance, find
 wrong, that's relatively easier thing us correct,
 politically ways.

 would mistake go 25 basis points time. think
 would mistake go asymmetric case.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 First Vice President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. Well, maybe stand sit
 issues. First District surrounded signs
 optimistic give rise optimism
 Districts, Boston Bank lot arguments
 getting ready Committee meeting. tended
 moving 25 basis points versus nothing. think
 could buy 25 basis points. think would smoothing
 markets would expected opposed stronger move
 might expected. also believe higher rates
 possibility weaker economy Greenbook
 projects, would like occur. large
 would favor 25 basis point increase. would also
 favor symmetric directive conference call want make
 change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, point view, terms
 evidence seen, good economic case
 move 50 basis points now. think need get higher
 level sooner rather later. Based listening remarks
 markets, however, I'm inclined go Governor Lindsey's
 proposal. trying bring certainty markets,
 think asymmetric directive would wrong read
 May meeting, would reintroduce uncertainty period
 
 3/22/94
 
 -50-
 
 meeting July meeting. directive means
 might something meetings think would
 confuse people. So, would favor symmetric directive go
 25 basis points. numbers economy differ
 expectations, conference call make
 decision time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, try make policy
 decision, suppose us extent guided
 forecasts. look Atlanta forecast, see rapid growth
 1994, much stronger Greenbook, inflation end
 1995 clearly unacceptable levels. said opening
 remarks, don't think that's likely outcome. think growth
 probably going come somewhere Greenbook
 Atlanta forecasts. reasonable probability
 Greenbook forecast could materialize. And, therefore, caution
 needed regard. think gradualism served us well
 side. would also add don't view 1/4 point
 increase insignificant level interest rates;
 really means something market. judgment, gradual
 approach create greater stability otherwise. also
 persuaded remarks financial markets. remember
 well last meeting, expression
 interest part move 50 basis points,
 language effect:
 "If that, going crack
 markets." 25 basis points think came close
 cracking markets. Now, I'm saying would happen
 50 basis points, think run risk don't think that's
 risk take.
 Therefore, think 25 basis points clearly appropriate
 particular environment. market expecting something
 greater course next several months, don't think
 it's necessary meet expectations particular point.
 came meeting, favor symmetric
 directive still would lean direction,
 certainly support asymmetry. sum, think 25 basis points
 way go.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, believe rates
 stimulative think ought seek neutral policy stance,
 wherever turns be. also believe robust
 expansion hypothesis probably likely, however robust may
 defined. certainly points suggest funds
 rate moved up. subject timing, believe
 real economy requires tightening move point
 think markets probably do; go 25 basis points.
 find 25 basis points argument compelling I'd real trouble
 move 50 basis points. far asymmetry goes, don't
 think traditional reasons best idea
 merits, also agree Larry Lindsey's suggestion would
 confusing. However, dissent that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 would prefer symmetry?
 
 3/22/94
 
 -51-
 
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 would prefer symmetry.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Okay.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Well, tough call. can't remember
 time call tougher right now. come
 good arguments, least mind,
 either 25 50 basis points. reflecting, come
 agreeing time 25 basis point move appropriate
 thing do. would favor asymmetric language. would
 favor symmetric language, disagree
 direction policy--I think moving again--but I'd
 rather make regular thing moves going
 dependent timing meetings Federal Open Market
 Committee. would opposed establishing kind pattern.
 Moreover, I'm general opposed asymmetric language.
 bad experience asymmetric language last spring and,
 therefore, I'd prefer leave language symmetric. think
 economy going dynamic phase
 keep pretty current contact go period.
 Therefore, I'd favor 25 basis points symmetric
 language understanding probably would phone call
 next meeting might make change point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. people already stated, certainly
 seems appropriate act now. far ought go fast
 ought try get there, difficult questions. best
 judgment we'll time; may well
 funds rate go 4 percent time done.
 don't strong conviction far need go.
 timing issue, seems probably going
 either confident today
 established environment renewed disinflation
 actually see renewed disinflation. may surprise us occur
 earlier something else may happen changes view
 appropriate policy. said that, think bear
 mind, I'm certainly willing humble this,
 confidence interval around forecast wide. think
 argues caution. So, I'm comfortable 1/4 point
 recommendation now. think appropriate magnitude.
 would prefer symmetric directive understanding
 need conference call, one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. I've expressed before, view
 monetary policy stimulative posture last
 three years and, like Al Broaddus, think quicker get
 neutrality, better everyone going be. think
 cumulative effects policy stance reflected already
 rising prices certainly rising inflationary expectations.
 judgment reacted cautiously
 developments last meeting, contributed uncertainty
 financial markets resulted higher long-term interest
 rates otherwise might seen. I'm saying
 would gone down, I'm sure would gone
 
 3/22/94
 
 -52-
 
 much, think 25 basis points stage runs risk
 sort reaction. Accordingly, favor moving aggressively
 meeting increased degree reserve restraint
 50 basis point increase funds rate. me,
 might even inclined underscore 50 basis point
 increase discount rate basically underline resolve
 contain inflationary pressures eventually resume progress toward
 price stability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. favor 25 basis points, prefer symmetric,
 would urge consider announcing decision.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. certainly think it's appropriate tighten.
 question get fast possible
 without causing disruption markets. seems important
 Fed add uncertainty. reason,
 certainly go along 1/4 point increases. I'd underline
 suggestion emphasizing constructive way
 finished tightening process. want get
 precedent-setting mode think easing
 important able right time. would prefer
 establish precedent taking action meetings. I'm
 sure asymmetric language adds. may well increase
 uncertainty. So, I'd inclined asymmetric
 language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, facetious, 25
 basis point approach sounds bit like taking Sword
 Damocles inflicting death thousand cuts economy.
 dies slowly anticipation next strike. Instinctively,
 would prefer best worlds 50 basis point move
 simple reason wrong economy moving faster
 thought, would seen little ahead
 curve, could still move further. preferable
 making move meetings reaction something that's
 published press. wrong side
 economy significantly weaker, stop 50 basis points;
 won't need additional moves perhaps. don't stop
 50 points; add another 25 necessary. hand,
 great respect analysis market risks involved
 50 basis point move, reluctantly agree 25 basis
 points symmetric language. That's all.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, must admit
 absolutely certain need move 50
 basis points 25 basis points least frequently daily
 last several weeks. I've come conclusion
 recommendation change safer course action us
 sufficiently bold maintain credentials. Greenbook
 forecast accurate materialize quickly
 
 3/22/94
 
 -53-
 
 projected, think would good us give
 opportunity see economy evolving, also leads
 25 basis point increase. Even though every bit stomach
 lining says heading toward funds rate 4 percent higher,
 don't concern waiting past meeting.
 much prefer 25 basis points economic reasons.
 reaction 25 basis point increase last
 meeting, Peter Joan pointed out, added enormously
 various developments mentioned. tendency
 financial analysts maybe think caused
 all, certainly first get things moving. think
 got good deal market effect good deal tightening
 25 basis points mind met 4th
 February. regards market effect, don't think normally
 deciding monetary policy based trying fine-tune
 markets unless one convinced, now, downside
 weakness economy could come crack market.
 said earlier quoted me, think that's probable,
 think risk significant enough it's worth taking
 seriously. Therefore, since cannot anticipate exactly
 reaction market would 50 basis points since
 overreaction last time, think better avoid
 risk risk/reward ratio difficult calculate.
 regards symmetry asymmetry, reasoning
 asymmetric directive way introduces new use asymmetric
 directive, least it's new me. think could explained
 Kohn's usual verbal skills minutes, something
 could live with. Left devices, would prefer
 symmetric; prefer asymmetric, would support it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let say I've back
 forth symmetric/asymmetric issue and, far I'm concerned,
 conference call serves exactly purpose. Indeed, might
 actually preferable gain benefits
 symmetric language minutes. support symmetric
 well would propose 25 basis points symmetric language. Would
 read directive.
 MR. BERNARD. "In implementation policy
 immediate future, Committee seeks increase slightly
 existing degree pressure reserve positions. context
 Committee's long-run objectives price stability

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, know somewhat bound
 tradition, sentence really don't need
 slightly slightly less reserve restraint
 intermeeting period. don't drop it? That'll take care
 observation fact it's slightly less probable
 easing going happen. It's symmetric.

 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. it's interesting question. Let's
 review intermeeting period. want read the-MR. BERNARD. Yes, Mr. Chairman sentence

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. still question
 announcement, call Kohn discuss that.
 MR. KOHN. I'll try brief, Mr. Chairman. Drawing
 work subcommittee, Messrs. Boehne, Kelley, Melzer
 considered couple options announcing decisions
 Federal Open Market Committee. hit finally
 best bet announce changes instrument settings much
 last time say did. is, case
 could say, using wording proposed Joe Coyne:
 "The Federal
 Reserve decided today increase slightly degree pressure
 reserve positions. action Federal Open Market Committee
 expected associated small increase short-term money
 market interest rates." thought sort
 announcement could coupled additional explanations
 Committee thought necessary unusual situations,
 important thing get fact acted.
 One option subcommittee thought releasing
 whole directive, disadvantages. would
 involve releasing symmetries asymmetries right away
 whatever left symmetry/asymmetry flexibility would
 
 -55-
 
 3/22/94
 
 certainly go away knowledge decision move
 markets. Committee might less likely adopt asymmetries.
 balance, subcommittee thought good idea
 release decision. reception public good last
 time. Fed looked open. effect ran
 experiment worked pretty well perspective.
 think one minor note hesitancy. Committee
 looked year ago, maybe little year ago,
 rejected announcement option. Committee concerned
 time would lose flexibility. two
 instruments: discount rate, rang gong; open market
 operations, didn't. February 4th experience, although
 lot special things involved, suggest possibility
 might stronger reactions announced moves
 markets public could complicate implementation
 open market operations time time. concern
 loss flexibility. thinking this, balance
 costs benefits view subcommittee shifted toward
 notion announcing changes instrument settings FOMC
 decided changes.
 also couple technical issues. One
 announce. thought best approach would set
 less fixed time afternoon day Committee met;
 would afternoon. early enough allow
 trading news markets late enough markets
 wouldn't sit around wondering long Committee met.
 is, would reasonable prospect finished work
 usual announcement time. wouldn't want usual
 announcement time go Committee still thinking
 decision, people assuming decision policy
 remain unchanged. time late enough would
 finish meeting early enough traded market,
 somewhere around 2:15 p.m. 2:30 p.m. seems right Bill
 McDonough me. announce think I've already covered.
 subcommittee think decision change
 announced; changes would announced. noted,
 subcommittee thought explanation last time
 would exception rather rule. would help maintain
 bit difference discount rate action open market
 operations. invite subcommittee members comment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, problem
 anything said far statement announce
 concerned. Committee going considering issues
 regarding openness months ahead. don't see
 advantage Committee separating issue, proopenness stand issues may incline us toward less
 openness fact going producing package
 road. So, would suggest Committee act Don's
 proposal today. certainly power Chairman
 make announcement wishes. personal advice would
 go ahead make announcement. think announcement
 Committee would committing pro-openness move
 
 3/22/94
 
 -56-
 
 would card would permanently lose future
 issues might open.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You're suggesting would
 form provisional statement similar last time.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 make statement.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Meaning words it's
 irrevocable decision Committee Chairman?
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 correct.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, wanted make couple comments.
 First all, favor announcing actions promptly whether
 taken meetings meetings. preference would make
 change act disclosure issues Larry
 Lindsey talked about, although accept separating them.
 think possibility announcing actions
 promptly adverse impact deliberative process.
 current climate think benefit providing
 information public outweighs whatever cost is. Obviously,
 that's difficult measurement issue.
 respect.to released, maybe
 misunderstood little discussed subcommittee,
 personally would favor releasing statement respect
 increased decreased degree pressure reserve positions.
 think statement respect impact short-term market
 rates, effect, something decoded. words,
 using different adjectives describe think
 effect money market interest rates going we'll
 de facto announcing targets. "Small" mean 25 basis points;
 "moderate" mean 50 basis points.
 
 don't know 50
 
 would mean; doesn't seem likely!
 MR. PARRY. thing could happen term
 "reserve restraint." saying slight change, "slight" may
 equivocate--
 
 MR. MELZER.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, let say that's
 interesting issue, that's major question would hate
 decision made today's meeting. almost prefer
 stay Governor Lindsey's suggestion get
 final decisions make judgment.
 MR. MELZER. Okay. I'm expressing views
 point. point would make I'm sure agree
 Larry Lindsey saying. something that,
 it's done well announced properly, positive
 public effect. practice going lock us
 sense won't get back disclosure issues
 months, may actions announce meantime.
 So, provisional behavior effect going set precedent
 
 -57-
 
 3/22/94
 
 lock us policy, anti-climatic
 announce it. Personally, think get much mileage
 announcing fact decision made get
 done. effect, trading away anyway, announce
 try get public relations benefit it.
 thing would say announcement continue
 disclosure practices review, think
 disclosure issues due course need reviewed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I'm disclosure
 would repeat said last time, really
 opportunity Committee discuss fully.
 number issues surrounding disclosure matter. Tom
 brought one them; others. procedural
 standpoint alone, think need opportunity discuss
 further. announce today, think we're going locked
 it. said announcement last time wasn't going
 precedential. twice, think going locked
 in.
 substantive grounds, haven't really taken
 account effect disclosure discount rate, effect
 directors. whole host things think
 really need take account systematic way. would
 strongly opposed anything today. think ought
 revert normal practice disclosing decision let
 markets pick deal soon
 issue together disclosure issues, Governor Lindsey
 indicated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. LAWARE.
 Forrestal said.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 would said substantially Bob
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. strong preference
 make announcement form. particular afternoon,
 whether it's Chairman whether it's Committee making

 doesn't lock Committee made decision it.
 think actually merit. long Ernie
 Patrikis consultation Virgil Mattingly assures
 legal concern ethical concern; is, go
 market way done years "announce"
 significant policy move operations open market, pros
 deal know anybody else does. may
 minute two before, gives market advantage,
 don't like. it's ethical matter, take quite
 seriously. doesn't mean--unlike case chairman
 well known committee--that ethics necessarily law
 nature. that's come issue. would prefer
 announce decision think it's probably better
 occasion Chairman rather Committee.
 
 -58-
 
 3/22/94
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. support subcommittee's recommendation.
 think latter part Tom Melzer's remarks right on.
 could say twice row, it's permanent
 it's precedent, still card play
 might future. Nobody would believe it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, don't think Larry saying anyone
 believe it. think mind it's useful
 intend whole package put together. That's
 think his-MR. JORDAN. going package May?
 Otherwise, going faced maybe three meetings row
 saying temporary procedure it's not-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 answer possibly.
 
 Well, that's good point.
 

 
 MR. JORDAN. It's eight weeks next FOMC meeting.
 It's longest period experience meetings.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would say good shot
 May. fact, precisely reason would useful.
 President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. One benefits immediate announcement
 eliminates perception leaks, would suggest
 always end meeting rather hiatus.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BROADDUS.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 would favor announcing now.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. I'm much favor announcing it. Whether
 it's announcement Chairman Committee think
 immaterial. today, think should,
 established precedent continue. think
 it's constructive change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, think announce
 merits case. time that. far today
 concerned, would uncomfortable holding decision overnight
 letting announced traditional way Desk action
 tomorrow. think would mistake. favor letting
 announcement rather Committee's reasons
 Governor Lindsey President McDonough discussed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. STERN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 agree Governor Kelley said.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 -59-

 MR. JORDAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 talking announcing today?

 MS. LOVETT.
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 
 Jerry, said yes
 
 auction today?
 

 
 was; it's over.
 
 It's over.
 auction over.
 
 Okay, I'd announce.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That's part timing issue--to
 get auctions over.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Ms. Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. must say impressed President
 Forrestal's comments.
 would like see disclosure decisions
 package would like see us committed announcing every
 time. general think announcement bad thing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let make following request.
 don't deny appear precedential.
 fact, think it's
 naive believe announce today it's going come
 way. marginal value
 making official time everything else. It's
 it's big deal, it's bigger package announce probably
 wise that. Unless strong objection, that's
 think I'd like do.
 MR. MELZER. don't strong objection, Alan.
 would Joe Coyne respond inquiries "What mean?"
 bound requests; what's answer?
 
 -60-
 
 3/22/94
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would basically say Committee
 come final conclusion.
 MR. MELZER.
 
 still considering disclosure issues?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Okay next meeting is-MR. BERNARD.
