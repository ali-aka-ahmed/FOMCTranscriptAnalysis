 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Interest dividends versus wages

 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Yes, small business income.
 
 MR. PRELL. share entire Committee broad
 terms expectations regard. personal income growth,
 substantial step-up regular salary disbursements. Nonfarm
 proprietors' income expected rise somewhat 1993,
 it's dramatic change. Wage salary disbursements

 MR. SYRON. know said one tries explain

 So, it's old plus young rich.
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 It's old plus young rich. Actually,

 So, would say actually borrow expand

 So, way would talk last three charts nonrich, non-old live paycheck paycheck, quite literally. That's

 Like national economy, District economy continues

 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, sense course events
 flux. far strength economy goes,
 thinking time last meeting indeed
 going strong fourth quarter would looking
 substantial moderation that. fourth quarter
 appear come meaningfully stronger thought
 seems accompanied considerably momentum
 anticipated. new data we've receiving recently look
 quite strong me. purchasing managers' report across
 components looks strong--in new orders, deliveries stretching out,
 prices paid. also got strong housing numbers
 strong new orders data. short, new data suggest
 economy momentum would thought; fact
 strikes wouldn't take whole lot begin use
 word I've heard couple times go-around--an
 emerging "boom."
 couple concerns worry me. Number one
 consumer debt seems accelerating, time
 ratio consumer debt worth still all-time high.
 debt service rate came
 never came off; flattened out.
 lower interest rates level absolute debt.
 get surge here, going setting kinds
 new records ratio debt income. particular
 concern would relate data Larry Lindsey gave us
 ago. That's pretty worrisome mind. Also, seem
 experiencing rather euphoric stock market; it's 11 percent
 last four months 6 percent since last meeting,
 goodness sake! kinds developments give concern
 could possibly heading something might look distressingly
 like bust somewhere road.
 inflation side, look things fairly
 long-term view, still look pretty good. like Tom Melzer--I
 written notes couple things mentioned--I
 concerns. Number one fourth-quarter CPI 3.4 percent,
 looks bit ominous. Also, world full capacity,
 commodity price indexes I've access to,
 domestic international, seem rather persistent upward
 drift. certainly wouldn't try say inflationary surge
 upon us inevitable.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Well, seems fundamentals
 housing, autos, capacity utilization, new orders, inventory levels,
 increased loan activity banks pointing toward continued
 growth, even stronger growth previously expected. tax
 shock health care uncertainties still unknown
 unmeasured probably governors keep economic
 engine running amuck. Perhaps even corporate re-engineering
 ho-hum, least getting heave-ho.
 [Laughter]
 Inflationary pressures may currently masked resulting
 euphoria financial markets probably bloated stock bond
 prices beyond rational values. may built profit
 expectations actual profit performance. short, think
 period expansionary forces economy seem
 emerging reasons caution rather
 contractionary forces reasoned fundamental before.
 Moderate growth seems consensus forecast,
 possibility inflationary behavior triggered inflationary
 expectations terms anticipatory price increases rather
 demand-driven price increases creates mood caution.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. sustainability recovery
 certainly seems considerably assured now. Leading way
 housing, autos, durables, clearly reflected IP index. People
 spending they're dissaving so. Inventories lean
 probably surprises supply side. Productivity
 improvements still provide opportunities competitiveness
 growth. think encouraging consumer business
 confidence; even earthquake cold didn't provide much
 disruption. less chance we're going another
 fading spell, don't think recovery
 considered fragile year ago. time, strong
 financial markets continuing provide financing, banks
 better positioned contribute. even making progress
 debt side. risks structural adjustments facing
 economy still there, think it's fair say new
 insurmountable ones appearing.
 
 People may gotten bit
 
 tired, John LaWare mentioned, talking corporate
 restructuring defense restructuring, pace balance sheet
 restructuring appears slackened. international front,
 there's glimmer economies major trading partners
 beginning bottom out, may see improvement there.
 labor market still showing signs stress due
 layoffs re-engineering, resulting part-time temporary
 employment downward mobility. fiscal policy side, think
 focus deficit may well contain many new initiatives;
 even health care proposals appear open negotiations.
 So, think there's bit less fear there, great
 surprises form major new expensive initiatives State
 Union message.
 inflation front, recent numbers certainly look
 good, particularly PPI deflator, think Committee
 pleased that. Progress underlying rate
 inflation, may still feasible, certainly going

 likely hit stone wall next months respect
 inflation, given problem seasonals, obviously, shortterm supply distortions. Many mentioned around

 think we're seeing major risks inflation front.
 Certainly, Greenbook acknowledged food price increases
 risks respect upcoming harvest, Tom Melzer mentioned
 particular. energy front, it's hard see
 depending cartel keep CPI check. And,
 course, precious metals' prices elevated. Certainly,

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Well, extended period
 flat regional economy, economic activity Second District

 what's particularly good District that, despite fact
 corporate giants like IBM, Citibank, Kodak

 regard national forecast, rather similar
 Greenbook exceptions. stronger real growth

 area capacity constraints, could
 additional cause inflationary pressures. general,

 I'd like express couple concerns, you've hit

 Bob Parry indicated, think essential

 risk we're going pushed pressures--not necessarily
 legislation pressures--to make ongoing operating

 So, concerns think

 That's much stronger start quarter
 
 Overall, taking things account, reading

 One final note average hourly earnings: .7

 -44-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Don? not, let get
 started. Much would usually say stated testimony
 Monday Joint Economic Committee, won't belabor
 that. one issue didn't raise, except minor way,
 consider potentially dangerous upside problems
 inventory area. looking inventory/sales ratios, tend
 combine wholesale, retail, manufacturing book value levels
 put constant dollars. interesting question
 procedure raises is, appropriately capture going on?
 answer "no." reason answer
 basically determines relationship orders, production,
 consumption, like units inventory. So,
 take wholesale retail inventory data, whose inventory/sales
 ratios trending upward much manufacturing, strip
 markups put back factory level values adjust
 manufacturing data factory level values, essentially
 markup, effectively significantly re-weight
 three major components. since manufacturing going down,
 sudden big impact total. Even strip
 work-in-process, get terms gross days' supply
 decline much abrupt official numbers.
 Now, one thing know forecasting
 inventories go zero, rate change cannot remain negative!
 models, incidentally, don't necessarily
 constraint! reason raise question we're seeing
 tranquil inventory situation. use just-in-time
 inventory management becoming increasingly evident. lead times
 deliveries materials ordered flat low.
 minor increase delays deliveries, usually
 sign tightening. interesting problem
 here: far inventory/sales ratios continue go?
 forecast saw yesterday Chart Show showed
 gradual flattening out. truth matter don't know
 it, know don't know. don't
 know what's going happen particular ratio. begin
 get evidence either pickup materials costs--and
 anticipatory element involved--or evidence tightening
 lead times deliveries, occurs operating rates begin
 move up, purchasing managers start increase inventory
 requirements. apocryphal everyone's inventories now,
 today's computer regimes, transit nobody
 anything. may partly true, can't wholly true
 there's still huge amount inventories sitting various
 places. Everyone may say emergency stocks system right
 probably lowest level history reason
 computer technology. I'm trying get
 there's one element tranquility forecast,
 gradually lulling us considerable complacency, it's
 inventory side. That's basically concerns
 readily could end problem suddenly find instead

 Therefore, seems question much

 50 basis points. would one think firming 50 basis
 points might appropriate? Well, might deemed closer
 true adjustment away forecast excessive
 accommodation. However, think two downside aspects
 50 basis point firming. First all, could interpreted--and
 view would interpreted fair number market
 participants--as one-time fix, one-time adjustment would
 followed "Fed-on-hold" period. Secondly, think could

 So, support recommendation
 Chairman tighten. preference 25 basis

 next 25 basis point move, equilibrium rate would move

 MR. JORDAN. Would preference 25 basis points

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's good question. stage

 would next move go asymmetric.
 MR. JORDAN. Well, follow up: preference
 always going symmetry, would like see done

 March meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, don't think

 Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. far economy goes, good
 gets terms convincing evidence move. always
 uncertainties; always reasons shouldn't make
 change. see self-feeding expansion think
 capacity price pressures far away. So, far
 economy goes, think need move. credibility side,
 there's time talk, time speculation, time act.
 We've talked, we've speculation, think time
 act.
 came meeting somewhat undecided 1/2
 1/4 point rate increase. think good reasons
 1/2 point move. difficult tighten ease,
 least historically. advantage getting
 job done fewer moves rather more. Historically,
 also tendency get behind curve rather stay ahead
 it. think larger move compensate risk.
 hand, think 1/2 point move may strong
 point. risk could appear eager. I've
 seen Committee operate 1970s; I've seen operate
 1980s 1990s; frankly, confidence willingness
 ability move promptly, move needed, high enough
 think 1/4 point move makes sense. also buy notion
 important market anticipate moves. think
 need forthcoming called for. So, history
 risks weigh heavily mind, balance come
 favor 1/4 point move support symmetrical directive.
 think really need full Committee support action;
 reiterate point yesterday, think ought make
 announcement sometime Joan Lovett would normally go
 market today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -49-
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, certainly think time
 come move need take action today. don't
 move, would put credibility seriously risk there's
 question really need move. don't, think
 fall way behind curve. terms amount, preference
 would 1/2 point move. stage game, given
 signs strength economy evidence nascent
 upward price pressures least places like purchasing
 managers data, worry 1/4 point juncture
 it's going seen rather timid move. think there's
 risk even making move, pretty shortly still
 behind curve. 1/2 point move, contrast, would decisive
 move. would help us get front thing develops
 would strengthen position. guess little
 difficulty understanding argument that's going create
 expectation going move time.
 believe expectations would determined unfolding events.
 Also, it's worth noting move funds rate
 3-1/2 percent nominal basis, real funds rate would still
 quite low one could still make argument policy even
 would quite accommodative. So, think case 1/2 point
 increase weak one, would preference, although
 could accept 1/4 point increase.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, decision altogether
 clear-cut mind. matter fact, view difficult
 decision. would like interject argument waiting
 little, argument would revolve around uncertainty
 economy. certainly demand surge fourth quarter
 would appear going continue extent. However,
 always question us whether level
 activity going continue. think uncertainty
 engendered income/debt ratios see, uncertainties
 surrounding economies trading partners, question
 whether capacity utilization rates given global competition
 meaningful were, possible effects fiscal policy-including uncertainty surrounding health plan could
 announced, suppose, next meeting. So, think
 things present case staying
 moment waiting. want make sure don't lose sight
 arguments. indicate it's close call
 mind, balance think arguments persuasive
 side marginal degree. would support moving
 meeting. credibility central bank very,
 important element time, think gain credibility
 moving even though might marginal risk
 might reverse course. Clearly, signs inflation
 heating little, vigilant that. So,
 would support recommendation. would go 25 basis points
 think gradual approach better point,
 would support symmetric directive.
 question inflation, would put something
 table, discussion something perhaps
 ought think about. I, one, really
 clear objective respect inflation. talk

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 sort thing.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 price index using,
 
 Yes.
 
 time period.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. throw suggestion
 Committee think about.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. agree it's certainly time move.
 three thoughts would prefer move 1/2 point 1/4
 point. First, staff yesterday's presentation said
 maintain price stability constant inflation raise
 interest rates 150 basis points mid-1995. make choice
 whether want move six times next year half
 three times. answer strong preference three
 times.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Suppose wrong?
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Well, anything, think risks
 going 150 basis points lower level
 inflation. think bias Committee possible
 want bring inflation little more. Furthermore, staff
 noted today GDP momentum seems stronger thought
 came 150 basis point estimate. So, based
 we've learned since forecast, seems risks
 side, would suggest even actions
 tighten. appreciated much Bill McDonough's analysis
 "Fed hold" versus first series moves. think
 way, though, minimize effect
 long-term growth, given amount disinflation. go
 1/4 point, telling markets first
 series we're going raising rates long period time.
 would seem signal extended period
 time average short-term rate going higher would
 quickly. since affects long-term growth
 equity prices long-term bond prices, slow gradual move--because
 means average higher long-term rates longer period--would
 damaging growth. would another reason, think,
 move suddenly.
 Finally, don't personal memories although
 alive time, successful Fed move inflation,
 recall read history, back 1966. first
 data showed recession then, recession revised away.
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -51-
 
 Fed able overcome inflationary condition short,
 sudden rise interest rates. downturn actually
 downturn simply slowing rate growth lasted
 six months brought country another two years high
 rates economic expansion. think 1966 model really
 want emulate today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Let interject.
 
 want correct sense history?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. history Fed took 10
 percent surcharge fiscal deflation didn't act. Fed
 wrong act rapidly order offset that, think
 period Fed excelled policymaking.
 MR. LINDSEY. 10 percent surcharge wasn't enacted
 1968 didn't take full effect 1969.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, expectation
 would fiscal drag, think Fed responded that.
 That's major issue; don't want prolong discussion
 happened reading episode recently.
 MR. LINDSEY. Okay. case, 150 basis
 points more, think greatest "bang buck," minimum
 harm long-term growth, would move 50 basis points today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, think yesterday's discussion
 morning's indicate really need take action now.
 amount, economic case 50 basis points
 think would longer term give us stable
 environment.
 Bill McDonough's arguments valid extent
 terms kinds reaction would get, think would
 take care would really better 50
 basis points.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. agree comments made
 appropriate time move, won't go
 rationale that.
 question magnitude, mild
 preference 50 basis point move basically grounds
 believe short-term interest rates move pro-cyclically. 1/4
 point increase point doesn't seem action
 much magnitude all. guess would get lost
 markets--that certainly won't happen--but it's going
 turn significant relative job ahead us.
 I'm right short-term rates move pro-cyclically, seems
 ought get started. Therefore, said, would
 mild preference 50 basis point move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would favor tightening
 point reasons mentioned. might note
 
 -52-
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 found discussion inventories quite interesting.
 Yesterday, characterized forecast similar
 Greenbook. One difference somewhat greater
 strength early part period largely result much
 higher nonfarm inventories assumed Greenbook forecast.
 regard amount move, favor 50 basis points.
 think it's appropriate move reasons
 mentioned. I'm favor 25 basis points. one wanted 25
 basis points, communicating best increases
 coming, think would drive one asymmetry. seems
 25 basis points symmetry doesn't represent
 us think.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. start out, guess disagree Bob Parry.
 came meeting thinking something.
 read expectations things are, would thought 25
 basis points would seen market something
 lacking courage testosterone part. want make
 observations, could ask question Joan
 comment process?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. SYRON. question is, Joan: think
 expectations market something?
 think market reaction would 25 basis points compared
 50 either announced hour now?
 MS. LOVETT. market anticipating move,
 think expectations 25 basis points.
 got built rate structure yesterday; think time
 day 80 percent reflected 1/4 point move might
 occur today. morning's numbers January employment
 situation may moved pricing back market.
 So, certainly move 50 basis points would reflected
 market. Since 25 basis points fully now, next
 25 basis points would clearly result rate back up; rates would
 adjust much have.
 MR. SYRON. Well, let continue. think policy
 stimulative don't think inappropriately
 stimulative. don't want argue month five six weeks
 one way other, went period needed
 something. want clearly maximize
 long-term growth economy, controlling real growth. Larry
 Lindsey said, controlling prices mechanism that.
 reason we're concerned prices care longterm real growth, abstract reason. there's
 long-term tradeoff, short term way things work--at least
 model--is can't avoid lost output edges;
 we're trying minimize interval lost output
 time. I'd cautious 50 basis points I'm
 sure raise rates 150 basis points. point
 wouldn't want start path fairly fixed notions
 I'm going end terms rates terms
 monetary policy. notion want get terms
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -53-
 
 economy, necessarily need get there.
 think policy time pretty effective. We're already
 might call orally asymmetric sense, given
 Chairman rather effectively testimony. would strongly
 suggest 25 basis points accompanying change
 process. don't forget big announcement effect
 way done fact haven't done anything
 17 months haven't tightened 60 months. would also
 suggest it's terribly long Humphrey-Hawkins hearing
 there's going plenty opportunity orally asymmetric,
 may use phrase again, indicate see things. So,
 think going 50 basis points would depreciating little much
 opportunity we're going put context may
 fully taking consideration announcement effect 25
 basis points announcing long period policy
 inaction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I've around long time
 watching markets behave tell 50 basis
 points today, high probability cracking
 markets. think would unwise procedure. far
 easier us start process smaller move. And, Dick
 Syron says, there's large announcement effect. stuck
 unchanged policy long, going far easier
 us get accelerated path need later time. go
 25 point think would bad mistake. could
 generate surprising counterproductive responses market.
 Strangely, far easier 50 basis points second move,
 first move.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 That's right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. big move,
 magnitude announcement effect, Dick Syron
 points out. would feel uncomfortable tried
 stage. think it's wrong pattern must say would
 make really uncomfortable.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Could make comment?
 
 Certainly.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. much share view
 effect 50 basis point move today marketplace highly
 unpredictable. It's sufficiently likely damaging cracking
 markets think it's step take.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Look, stock market elevated
 level stage measure know of. could set
 sequence events think could make policy path
 developing difficult one. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Well, preference tighten 1/2
 point immediately. It's probably strong say 1/4 point
 move following market good deal already built
 market. think cyclical influences
 1/4 point move won't much effect. don't see anything
 horizon would warrant asymmetric directive. Now, said
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -54-
 
 that, say live 1/4 point "Fed hold"
 theory expectation come.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, I'm camp prefers 25
 basis points. sure whether early right
 late; don't know history going judge that.
 reasonably confident we're seriously late conditions
 process running away us side.
 don't see economy overheated now. see process
 approaching full employment still meaningful soft
 spots. President Parry among others mentioned important places
 that's still evident economy. don't think need
 strong shock. need new policy momentum.
 momentum rest long time; think need change
 time it. believe 25 basis points would
 establish that; would put new framework marketplace
 new orientation policy. view that's needed
 point rather serious move that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. certainly buy fact time
 make change policy toward constraint. really favor
 50 basis point move point, respectfully disagree
 assessment move would crack markets. think
 markets already discounted 25 basis point move
 still burning away great rate. would like see stronger
 move 25 basis points simply damp without crash
 stock market particularly. think getting increasingly
 dangerous way running. believe 50
 basis point move send unmistakable message damp
 enthusiasm stock market without causing crash.
 successfully scotches inflationary expectations may part
 structure long-term rates, may salubrious
 effect bringing long-term rates, don't think 25 basis
 points that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, certainly favor moving and, like
 others, debated mind difference move
 25 50 basis points. impressed tone comments
 yesterday. seem significant
 shift toward strength reports heard yesterday
 contrasted December. despite that, must say
 uncertainties still remain. Things looking awfully good
 questions we've talked still need
 answered. So, come favoring 25 basis points. seem
 25 basis points announcement--which may turn
 precedential least morning would unprecedented--will
 strong signal effect. Therefore, think effect
 get 25 basis points action
 contemplate. regard symmetry versus asymmetry--and
 different thought--I've come conclusion ought get
 rid asymmetric language forever. seems cause far
 complications it's worth. going move,
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -55-
 
 particularly foreseeable future, think ought
 result conference call participating
 opposed getting wrapped asymmetric language. So, would
 strongly favor symmetry continuous basis.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 you're going
 MR. MCTEER. question remains:
 cut cat's tail, optimum number snips? Normally
 answer one. policy context, think
 translates 50 basis points, could certainly live
 recommendation 25 basis points plus announcement effect.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, rarely feel strongly
 issue, rarely sort press Committee. let
 tell something what's gnawing here.
 sympathetic view we've got move we're going
 extended period moves, assuming changes
 going continue direction strength.
 unlikely recent rate economic growth simmer
 largely developments involved particular period
 clearly one-shot factors--namely, dramatic increase
 residential construction big increase motor vehicle sales.
 Essentially two added one-shot elements growth.
 context saving rate high, probability
 direction expansion slowing recent pace,
 moment well 4 percent and, adjusting weather
 effects, may running 5 percent. sustainable
 growth, nothing monetary policy.
 words, come down. way 3 percent growth feels,
 may put way, lot different way expansion
 feels now.
 would concerned Committee went 50 basis
 points don't think markets expect it. want
 hit market needs hit; significant evidence
 stage imbalances require type action
 number us discussed. go 50 basis points
 announcement effect shock effect, telling
 markets hold still. I've economic
 forecasting business since 1948, I've Wall Street since
 1948, telling pain pit stomach,
 past I've successful alluding to.
 telling you--and I've seen markets--this time
 this. think time; staff's forecast
 right, get 150 basis points pretty easily.
 couple 1/2 point jumps later markets
 position know we're there's continuity. really
 request this. request willing move
 fairly soon, maybe larger increments; depends
 things evolving.
 also would concerned Committee
 concert stage Committee going
 things rest world going like.
 that's job. perceived split
 issue significant this, think we're risking
 serious problems organization. don't think
 
 2/3-4/94
 
 -56-
 
 philosophical difference anywhere around room. somebody asked
 think economic case 50 basis points, answer
 "most certainly case."
 think case
 full context financial markets stage
 expectations markets stage?
 would say
 emphatically "no."
 It's far risky. don't need take
 risks. could see significant benefit 50 basis
 points, would say let's it; don't see it.
 Bob.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, certainly made points
 strongly points one wants take account.

 think concern favoring 50 basis points may
 related long time next meeting.
 possible, something compromise, could
 agreement telephone meeting intermediate point
 two meetings see things changed extent?
 certainly would benefit seeing market reaction
 25 basis point move. addition that, we'd
 information economy, particularly inventory side, maybe
 could discuss developments again.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's perfectly fine me.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, could make specific,
 would recommend 25 basis points today conference
 call within two days Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Upon evidence?
 
 MR. SYRON. May ask procedural question?
 favor Bob's
 suggestion. would little concerned setting precise

 think careful we're

 I'm
 watching developments are. I'd soon set

 phone call?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Yes.
 
 wouldn't put fixed date.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. would strongly prefer
 set precedent Chairman, particularly Chairman,
 agree advance need phone call. record
 he's going call us there's something talk
 us call say think there's something talk
 request telephone conference. think it's demeaning

 "I'll vote want we've got phone call."

 really think that's terrible precedent set.

 MR. SYRON. agree also agree

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 Yes, think Bob saying precisely
 
 MR. JORDAN. I'm willing defer judgment
 market reaction, logic position 50 basis
 points really would correct move except constraints
 market, we've done 25 basis points overcome
 concerns market reaction would come second
 installment fairly promptly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'm belief economy
 behaves strongly behaving recently, means
 forecast wrong required rather less.
 think it's soon make judgment. economy
 continues move, especially inventory issue raised
 begins show head, would strongly supportive much
 rapid and, frankly, larger moves.
 Let make suggestion move 25 basis points
 symmetry, watch process closely,
 evidence suggests situation simmering down,
 telephone conference appropriate time. point
 decide nothing, move further, suggest another telephone
 conference; number things. would effectively
 continuation meeting. So, would request that. don't
 request often try stay together. That's
 required here. think we're much focus. It's
 though us think shouldn't anything, think
 ease, think tighten. We've
 occasions past that's legitimate difference reflected
 nature Committee itself. listened last two
 days, didn't sense significant difference within Committee
 purpose goals we're doing. would request
 that, can, act unanimously. potent message
 various communities deal stand together.
 going get split vote, think create
 problem us, don't know play out. rarely ask
 this, know. one times really
 together I'd hate vote somehow imply something
 agreement tightening move fact exists

 want say something?
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 answered question.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. understand it, basically
 two ways looking monetary aggregates. Either we're going
 look make usable useful policy determination
 not.
 come back vogue working,
 want range consistent price stability.
 understand it, that's 1 5 percent M2, it's working.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Right, assuming flat velocity.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. KOHN. monetary aggregates could come back sense

 range.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 that's right one,
 question interim? choice making

 matter. Paul Sarbanes said, we've shot bullet drawn

 I'm almost inclined say ought leave is,

 MR. SYRON.
 
 lower raise it?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think raising gives wrong
 signal. We've trying get M2 range price stability,
 finally got here. may true M2 isn't working,
 range working!
 [Laughter]
 M2 comes back, actually
 pressured move it. Anyway, supposed
 question!
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, possible answer may

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, technical problem

 compensating balances earnings effects, even so,
 think, there's issue accounts. time deposit rates
 maybe even savings deposit rates start rise market interest
 rates, funds shifted accounts-because rates accounts small time deposits
 much different--may well shifted back time deposits.
 So, think accounts particular become extremely
 interest sensitive. that's see velocity M1--on

 So, major effect demand deposits
 
 MR. KOHN. Demand deposits accounts well.
 think rising interest rates pull funds

 MR. LAWARE. underlying assumption

 MR. KOHN. would assume spread would widen.
 experience account rates adjust slowly
 sluggishly whereas small time deposit rates recent years
 come adjust fairly rapidly. would think retail CD rate
 would rise lag fairly promptly fed funds rate rose
 market interest rates adjusted higher,
 account rate would quite sluggish.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. couple questions, Don, table

 projections, first question relates Chairman's remarks
 ranges. understand M2 projection outer
 years, three alternatives M2 upper, upper
 half them, even 1 5 percent. would assume
 went alternative II, 0 4 percent M2, would

 MR. KOHN. Yes, although think baseline little
 toward upper end, assuming special trends
 velocity come end. declines short-term
 rates 1996 1997 tighter easier alternatives,
 push money growth little. long-term rates coming
 yield curve flattening. So, special
 factors, pushing money growth there.

 underlying assumption consistent Chairman said,
 is,
 aside special factors shape
 yield curve, years assumed--without evidence yet
 it's happening--that big shifts money demand cease.
 MR. JORDAN.
 look nominal GDP projections

 It's constraints impose; you've

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 President Boehne.
 
 don't questions this.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. questions? not,
 would somebody like start roundtable want do?
 MR. SYRON. agree think implicitly
 Chairman's suggestion, would leave ranges alone.
 understand point Larry raised debt, could go
 either way that. personal view risks
 putting little fine point this. That's tactical issue;
 it's substantive issue. think comment correct,
 given level knowledge things disruptions

 relatively small change one ranges think
 could imply ability forecast understand things

 presenting forecast 1995, would fairly serious

 carefully whether want not. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, don't think change
 targets reasons Dick Syron went through. agree
 him. Given kinds uncertainties we're facing M2,
 especially now, think raises problem.
 nominal anchor explicit way raises problem monetary
 policy, don't think putting 1995 forecasts would
 solve problem. would raise questions would
 answer preferences tradeoffs lot things. So,
 think would bad idea. way deal

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, think many
 uncertainties point respect M2 shouldn't
 change range. uncertainties magnified fact

 quickly, defections asset funds; effect could fact

 there's enough scope current ranges adjust policy way

 lines, although wouldn't suggest ready to, we'd
 better set nominal GDP target which, course, implies
 inflation target. That's something might want explore
 connection setting provisional ranges 1995, we're
 certainly ready talk seriously right now.

 I'd like us publish CPI objectives 1999, sure
 don't like numbers companions them.

 Don't publish 1995 unless come better
