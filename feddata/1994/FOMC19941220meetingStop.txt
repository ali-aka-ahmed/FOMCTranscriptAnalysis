 MR. JORDAN. couple things follow

 MR. PRELL. fact, didn't quite get back

 MR. JORDAN. Okay. expected answer. Let follow
 raises big concern February meeting.
 time meeting, submit projections

 Chairman going position saying

 12/20/94
 
 MR. PRELL. don't know anything say!
 certainly occurred taking numbers
 might provide somewhat unappealing forecast Humphrey-Hawkins
 report. forecast far consensus view among
 economists little degree optimism, suggested,
 wouldn't put ballpark. don't want prescribe
 people say here. forecast clearly slight
 uptick unemployment end next year, slight
 uptick inflation, growth modestly
 people's assessment long-term trend. little bit
 lower, think, consensus forecast point GDP

 forecast. admit differences, think
 consistent.
 MR. TRUMAN. could add two points: One is--I'm
 sure helpful--my impression Administration going

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MR. BLINDER. I'd like ask question Mike keys
 finished Jerry Jordan. Yesterday
 briefing, Governor Yellen asked Mike question difference
 forecasts attributable tightenings embedded
 Greenbook forecast yet acted upon FOMC. cited
 numbers generated staff model. Mike, indicated
 didn't really accept numbers. I'd like know--it
 germane question asked--what would
 forecast constant funds rate difference forecast
 constant funds rate path funds rate path embedded
 staff forecast?
 MR. PRELL. model simulation done using
 constant funds rate slightly growth 1995
 appreciably greater growth 1996.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Right.
 
 -6-
 
 12/20/94
 
 MR. PRELL. model's assessment, would add several
 sense,
 tenths inflation rate 1996.
 difference one stable inflation slightly 3 percent
 versus accelerating price picture inflation rate moving
 mid-3 percent range 1996.
 don't basis
 seriously questioning outlook. think risk
 near term that, economy behaves anything like
 anticipating fed funds rate remain 5-1/2
 percent, inflation expectations could mount ways wouldn't
 anticipated structure model.
 manifest
 market expecting much tightening built in,
 more. recent response markets tightening action
 shows rather sensitive indications going
 resist inflationary tendencies. common forecast
 inflation move up.
 I'd say consensus 3-1/2 percent,
 looking Blue Chip forecasts 1995.
 think would
 considerable worry--unless clear indications economy
 weakened next couple months--if Fed move
 rate significantly.
 MR. BLINDER. wasn't pushing constant-funds-rate policy;
 asking effects policy were, particularly
 real growth rate inflation rate. fourth-tofourth quarter basis, forecast real GDP growth decelerating
 4.1 percent 1994, 1.9 percent 1995, 1.8
 percent 1996.
 accepted staff model
 backed effects coming tightening, 1.9 percent
 1.8 percent would change 2.1 percent 2.5 percent. Now,
 way thinking marginal effect new policy
 respect timing, wouldn't expect inflation effects
 zilch 1995, pretty mild 1996, fact mostly
 impact 1997?
 talking additional policy changes,
 tightenings banked already.
 MR. PRELL. think inflation mounts because,
 alternative, running unemployment rate remains
 NAIRU 1996 presumably 1997,
 getting accelerating picture.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Sure.
 
 I'm talking derivative.
 
 MR. PRELL. think near term, taking
 account exchange rate import price effects on, model
 begins get additional inflation creeping within 1995
 building bit.
 gradual probably undiscernibly
 different. goes back comment made earlier.
 could creep you, sustaining low unemployment rate,
 happened late 1980s, eventually build significant
 pickup inflation. forecast designed
 avoid.
 MR. BLINDER. questioning that;
 misinterpreted question; marginal effects

 likely, exactly said ought happening. marginal
 effect inflation policy tightening today forward, way
 thinking, ought Greenbook page. really

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. reminds discussion
 remember CEA 1973 everyone talking
 small inflationary effects horizon--0.2 0.3
 percent. models really gross simplifications real
 world. I've indicated before, simulations reduced-form
 structures, without appropriate add-ons give us silly forecasts,
 employed great degree confidence

 discussing really marginal. careful
 reading terribly much it.
 remember,
 econometric structure model engendered significant

 difference add-ons underlying structure don't
 capture.
 I'm saying useful discuss
 potential impacts lags are; hope everyone
 retains large dose skepticism applying types
