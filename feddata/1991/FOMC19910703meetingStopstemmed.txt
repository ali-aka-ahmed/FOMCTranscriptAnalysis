 even though it's increas monei growth? i'm sure

 mr. hoskin.

 mr. prell. recogn artifici but,

 mr. parri.

 mr. parri.
 mr. hoskin.

 mr. parri.
 
 right.
 veloc usual neg eight
 right.
 
 mr. prell. note on thing suggest
 us possibl there's less monetari impuls
 recoveri fact thu far haven't seen much
 acceler monei stock.
 look real m2 past cycl,
 exampl, it's clear around trough earli
 recoveri typic mark acceler.
 mr. kohn.
 address sinc subject
 rais, i'll skip get brief. see coupl
 thing differ time past recoveri.
 first, still predict downward shift monei
 demand. we've histori last year monei fall short
 we'd expect, given nomin incom interest rate.
 base
 histor experi, we're predict continu,
 although diminish rate.
 so, downward shift
 monei demand haven't previou expans.
 secondli,
 came in, mike said, less steepli slope downward
 believ lot extra monei
 trajectori interest rate.
 got earli expans lag effect
 previou stimulu come in. consider less stimulu
 come trough, term trajectori feder

 rate, we've expans.
 expans we've ever without reg q without reg q remov.

 so,'those three factor think differenti

 mr. hoskin.
 point rational;
 anticip it, it's sensibl argument. problem, look
 back 30 year m2, kind special factor

 troubl we're move awai

 mr. hoskin. well, want rais on last point that's

 mr. angel. lee hoskin almost ask question,
 quit. scenario realli help
 present help, suppos it's alwai natur
 somebodi want someth els. on item would like

 had, cours, would on control.
 is, i'd like seen altern scenario keep monei

 mr. prell.

 clearli, could fine-tune extent
 get littl unemploy littl less later.

 bother also acceler path unemploy.
 mr. angel.

 mr. kohn. think basic point without

 mr. angel. fine-tune it, don,
 would probabl take 6-1/2 percent 1992 unemploy rate bit
 mayb take 7-1/4 percent.
 mr. kohn.
 
 ye.
 
 mr. prell. well, there's anoth option.
 think
 consid get thi--and he's discuss past--that
