 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm glad gave us chance
 take look this. don't think would surprise anyone

 like Governor Angell, don't know answer would lead; Al
 Broaddus certainly doesn't know exactly would lead. I've
 never really comfortable trying control aggregates

 I'm illusions we're really put [policy]

 couple things papers really quite [helpful].
 interesting points conveyed examples Dave Lindsey's

 arguments interesting. past we've gotten [worthwhile]

 So, think papers useful.

 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, look back policy

 would marginally favor first option Lindsey paper.
 thing occurred time we've
 discussing this, least picked inference--and may
 wrong--that flexibility funds rate would somehow
 protect us political pressures move

 don't really buy that.

 political pressure notwithstanding funds rate.

 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, I'm trouble getting used

 two reasons.
 One lowest forecast real growth
 among Committee members; thought given
 Mike [Prell] I'd almost willing meet half way. So,
 
 8/20/91
 
 -31-
 
 maybe lower forecast begin '91. second reason
 may strange, I've Colorado,
 Colorado seems quite different many years
 long recession. look Colorado, see runways
 runways runways built; I've never seen many runways
 construction--both Colorado Springs Denver. there's new
 atmosphere there. shows ways system

 minor factor explain much U.S. economy.
 it, then, gives optimism?

 Maybe optimism also due fact real

 minor, steps taken time, long bond prices would respond

 long bond prices Treasuries 8.10 percent we've
 even gain mortgage-backed securities; spreads
 Treasuries narrowing considerably. seems
 bodes well housing recovery--which gradual

 final reason optimism optimism regard

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Don?
 not,
 let get started discussion. Incidently, one problems

 anecdotal reports we're getting lot people reflection

 basically, that's issue going continue confront

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, cases would agree
 Lee, think special factors work here.
 So,
 would buy three recommendations--"B," asymmetry toward
 ease, version II.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would agree
 recommendation alternative B.
 seem clear economy
 likely undergo moderate recovery that--also similar
 Greenbook forecast--we'll see modest gains regard inflation.
 However, feel risks sides forecast
 I'm sure they're unbalanced.
 So,
 preference, would symmetric language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, agree "B"
 recommendation. Like President Parry, would prefer symmetric
 language.
 guess I'm persuaded enough certainty
 behavior M2 think push button make
 happen.
 don't expect projection growth levels
 different scenarios necessarily going happen
 way. So, would prefer "B" symmetric.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN.
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.

 seems whatever explanation M2 may be--and don't
 know we'll ever fully satisfactory one--this
 time let either fall target path deviate
 significantly performance last four years so.
 So, think pay attention it.
 probably
 go language version II, giving M2 somewhat greater
 prominence circumstances, think appropriate.
 
 -39-

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, given risks see them--I

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. KEEHN.
 
 would go directive
 
 Version II.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, certainly concur "B"
 asymmetric toward ease recommendation, would prefer language
 version I. don't want quarrel it; I'm going vote
 "no" it. light long inertia, discussed
 earlier morning, factors we've discussed around

 nature would call departure [from wording]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think one make fairly
 persuasive case easing now. would make basis

 MR. MELZER. prefer "B" symmetric, voting

 Let's say we're
 sitting month M2 still performing we're
 much comfortable see unfolding anecdotally

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 think legitimate case making
 move now, perhaps there's somewhat persuasive case stay
 asymmetric toward ease assess impact last move.
 lower long rates may impact, get returns
 events unfold, moves may bit impact later
 on.
 So, would support asymmety toward ease, although seems
 way things shaping probability pretty high
 would also marginally prefer version I,

 would marginally favor

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, hearing Mike Tom,
 think would really prefer version I.
