 MR. ANGELL. Unfortunately, time public officials make

 MR. KELLEY.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. move
 reviewing issue discussed previously. may recall
 Governor Kelley raised question respect directive
 language relating intermeeting instructions. We've gone
 series [discussions] thought might useful
 Governor Kelley could bring us date stand
 perhaps make recommendations might finally resolve
 question.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Committee
 recall inconclusive discussion matter August
 20th, Chairman asked me, good help Norm Don,

 appreciate response Committee members. Everyone participated
 say still definitive.
 presented three options. poll came 7 option 1, 7
 option 2, 2 option 3, left us bit quandary.
 result that, felt least come back today
 put table two recommendations either

 you'll turn pages 17

 Alternative II would represent continuation current

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think Governor Kelley done us
 real service bringing question up, would strongly
 support recommendation seconded you.
 I'm particularly pleased

 MR. KELLEY.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 especially you, Bob!
 Well, others too--you included,

 MR. KELLEY.
 
 Sure.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 Governor Kelley ought know hard change
 we've done this.

 MR. BLACK.

 advantage it.
 wish thought mention that!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think clear
 improvement have, would support Governor Kelley's
 recommendation.
 take Governor Angell's point; there's something
 said that.
 hand, don't think we're precluded
 making change point really wanted send
 signal.
 So, look forward reviewing next year.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 also read tape support this.

 agree Governor Angell it's useful mechanism
 signal special concern. mentioned exchange markets;
 might also case stock market weak financial
 institutions weak might want signal that's
 concern. Bob Forrestal said, still could that.
 think
 improvement overall, though, would support it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. word two new members:
 seriously believe you're hearing people
 falling basically people falling in,
 people sell Brooklyn bridge! Governor LaWare.
 MR. LAWARE. would much prefer alternative III.

 Questions either
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mike, we've talked lot consumer

 much take account forecast Conference Board
 surveys Michigan Survey results?
 MR. PRELL. Well, [the reliability the] information
 getting data matter considerable dispute among
 researchers. think considerable evidence add
 something relevant data one judging consumer
 spending currently. increment knowledge

 taken sign early on, saw drop last month's
 figures, going weak quarter consumer
 spending; wouldn't want read much point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. key assumptions section, discussed

 likely possibilities are.
 Winn, guess.

 MR. PRELL. Well, would duck anyone could!
 strong conviction composition magnitude

 happen, would put in. really don't know.
 significant differences among packages, [such as] emphasis

 significantly different, think, timing potential dimension.
 MR. PARRY. seems lot them, effort

 MR. PRELL. Well, fact one reasons--and
 think
 think least hinted it--why didn't put in.

 still feel somewhat constrained point size
 budget deficit Budget Act itself. one seems talking
 really large net fiscal impulses, felt wouldn't
 missing much including package forecast
 point merely suggesting direction likely

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, [raised] question equipment
 spending.
 face pretty significant change,
 different concepts extent, equipment spending
 Greenbook last Greenbook. There's discussion
 this, curious:
 almost entirely attributable
 changes weights computer sector that, terms
 think businesses reacting, nothing read
 forecast equipment spending quarter compared last
 quarter?
 MR. PRELL. Well, change computer deflators went
 index major factor change forecast.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 must big change!
 
 MR. PRELL. we've also anticipated, light
 stalling overall activity, there's going greater
 deferral equipment spending.
 there's element fundamental
 change forecast.
 might also note revisions
 national income accounts give larger weight nonresidential
 construction business fixed investment. given that's
 weak component forecast, also tends damp
 expansion business fixed investment forecast.
 MR. TRUMAN. One aspect trade
 computers, subject kind influences,
 seem structural shift.
 trade
 computer area, broadly defined, essentially
 balanced trade. We've gone situation slight
 surplus [area] balanced trade. seems associated
 largely change structure market whereby
 mainframes forth de-emphasized peripherals,
 software, computer processing [equipment]
 emphasized more.
 [These categories] tend come
 abroad [they subject to] kinds relocation

 process seems unfolded course 1991,
 see basis [assuming] change. Therefore,
 sense stronger import component computer-related demands

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions?

 would like start off?
 MR. MELZER. Alan, I'll start theory say

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, I'll admit feeling bit
 gloomy side.

 policy actions deal risk.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think it's difficult time

 difficult now. Looking back, vast majority forecasts--and
 certainly includes forecast--underestimated strength

 guess really realize restructuring

 eliminate existing jobs--forever probably--but also
 raise lot doubts minds others job security,

 we've aware important structural changes
 taking place economy, underestimated extent
 restraining consumer income spending. And, course,
 highly uncertain environment, disinflation process
 making increasingly difficult businesses pass

 cautious inventory management, mention capital

 MR. BOEHNE.
 Philadelphia District, I'd say [activity]

 Manufacturing, relative bright spot earlier

 may last while.
 Turning nation, Greenbook forecast certainly
 reasonable, think risks still side, perhaps

 It's difficult find

 comments already made and, Greenbook forecast
 currently depicting, risks probably symmetric.
 puzzling long time attitudes, particularly business
 attitudes, bad are, given aggregate data don't

 that, 3 percent kind number haven't heard Twin

 recognizing that's somewhat artificial distinction.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Even though seems
 economy dead water--and forecasts fourth
 quarter first quarter certainly suggest that--I think it's
 
 better look economy balanced certain sectors
