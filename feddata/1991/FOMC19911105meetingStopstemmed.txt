 mr. prell.

 mr. hoenig. mai ask follow-up tom's question?

 describ economi, fundament term real

 constrain.
 eas now, judgment risk
 push inflat [up] compromis abil bring

 mr. prell.
 real estat easier factor consid.
 leverag get littl difficult pin down--i.e.

 you're go make kind progress toward lower rate
