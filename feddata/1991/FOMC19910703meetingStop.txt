 So, precedents; [of recoveries]

 MR. PRELL. Well, one since Korean

 So, downward shifts

 So, working interest rates

 It's fast.

 MR. PARRY. Well, one nice thing that, given

 MR. KOHN. Well, fact, 5 percent growth year

 So, reason would like need

 primary challenge, course, maintain downward trend
 inflation we're dedicated to, particularly
 important recovery flourishes. alternatively,
 able provide sustainable broadening recovery

 also sees us bit frustrated far

 would even suggest aggressive signal might

 come see Federal Reserve tending over-react
 frustration getting faster inflation progress.
 So, signal-wise
 perception increased level aggressiveness point may
