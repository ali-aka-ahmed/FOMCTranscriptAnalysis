 Sam Cross,
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 Mr. Chairman, also might take moment mention
 circulated memorandum Committee questions related
 investment German marks. memorandum points out, almost
 marks three-month double-forward facility
 Bundesbank. causes problem Bundesbank terms

 Bundesbank uses funds for.
 concerned
 seeking get change facility, we're looking
 possibility modification. need work out,
 course, Bundesbank Treasury many
 technical questions look into.
 memorandum also suggests might look
 possible change approach broadly.
 mentioned
 possibility three-point approach dealing DM
 yen balances. first element would would work
 arrangement whereby either regularly time time seems
 appropriate would put earnings receive various
 reserve holdings back market sell ways.

 second element would would continue look

 suggested might also consider modest diversification
 facilities might less heavily focused
 short-term, three-month facilities available twoday notice--less heavily focused Bundesbank facility
 similar facilities.
 might think putting somewhat greater
 portion, example, BIS arrangement
 sort.
 We'd try work matter Bundesbank;

 part general examination could also consider
 diversification might move small portion balances
 somewhat longer German government paper beyond 12-month limit
 we've held point. There's little
 short-term paper available Germany, reasons
 diversification might appropriate consider somewhat
 flexible approach. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions Mr. Cross?
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 One question, Sam:
 off-market sales marks?
 
 real prospects
 
 MR. CROSS.
 Well, we're halfway process

 advisable.

 consult Treasury SEC well.
 Even though don't think bear decision,
 whatever is, can't underscore enough large complex

 look relative Drexel, example,
 Drexel literally looks like fly elephant's behind terms

 Drexel, insignificant parts balance sheet booked

 Again, that's bigger bread basket. One things,

 swap book was, among things, instrumentality
 incredibly complex hedging positions developed.
 So, it's take swap book carve
 without carving important implications
 instruments balance sheet.
 maturities swap book run much 10 years; they're
 interest rate swaps. highly complex swaps
 involve interest rates exchange rates. three
 four five interest rate/swap-type transactions tied
 currency swaps might involve six seven different
 currencies, that's basically one transaction. difficulty

 10/1/91
 
 people recognize extremely big very, complex
 firm. Again, it's bears one
 do; say that, part process coming
 whatever conclusions reached, consider,
 seriously, possible contingencies could arise.
 Mr. Chairman, think that's want say point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 vulnerable institution this.
 Again,
 probably place talk it, think important
 talk forum.
 MR. LAWARE. Jerry, would removal primary dealer
 status bring firm down?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, that's obviously tough
 question. prevailing view among people markets
 abroad, including prominent foreign officials--the
 prevailing view among choose express view
 me--is, yes. Now, doesn't mean view right.
 certainly think possibility.
 It's one things
 hard judge.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Yes.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. second question, course,
 even thought would, judge follow-on
 systemically?
 propos Ed Boehne's questions,
 institutional point view, risks sides even
 that.
 Now, certainly people say institutional
 reputation damaged don't something like that.

 produced kind problem, institutional
 reputation could damaged opposite direction. So, it's
 very, difficult question.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 need Solomon!
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 surely do.
 
 MR. MELZER. Jerry, begins sort out--I
 don't know potential obviously we're dealing
 confidence here--it seems important part this,
 possible, whatever decision reached
 jumped key politicians right left.
 don't know that-comment.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. think that's thrust Ed's
 there's win-win see.
 MR. MELZER.
 
 Right.
 
 10/1/91
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Jerry, think two kinds responses
 involved in. One response firm
 violated ethical principles regard falsifying reports,
 issue itself. problem seems
 important Federal Reserve address entire
 question whether small group, sense, ought
 privileged access. vein I'm wondering far
 road would us able electronic ability

 presume takes quite bit

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, let say two things
 that, Wayne. First, know, part interagency review
 process looking hard steps taken
 accelerate programs already drawing board.

 don't firm answer much done accelerate
 process.
 unambiguously clear kind electronic
 bidding system would help [alleviate] problems.
 means panacea. think, example,
 Salomon three things:
 One violated auction
 rules; two systematically lied it; three
 used set customer relationships within
 existing rules piece together complicated financing
 arrangements customers produced
 "squeeze."
 Squeezes good; squeezes bad.
 That's
 problem right.

 may say rules wrong;
 could done entirely within existing rules.
 issue mind ways fundamental fact
 broke rules.
 nothing question
 penalties, punishments fitting crimes, that.
 terms
 way market works, electronic bidding system isn't going
 darn thing deal issues.
 thing important keep mind one
 least speculate--and that's is--that even
 sophisticated electronic bidding system trading system might still
 result situation, indeed suspect would result
 situation, still would relatively small number
 large institutional players going very,
 prominent dominant part market.
 addition, even
 sophisticated electronic bidding trading system
 provide answer question
 counterparties are.
 that's nub so-called moral
 hazard problem arises.
 long deal
 somebody, kind objective standard.

 day age "Government Sunshine" rest it,
 wouldn't last 5 minutes saying:
 "Well, that's business nobody
 else's business."
 So, electronics help lot,
 frankly retrospect probably--not probably,
 putting emphasis that--as know well,
 perceived question priorities. We've put huge amounts
 resources upgrading book entry system itself; we've
 
 10/1/91
 
 put huge amounts resources Treasury direct; we've put huge
 amounts resources savings bond thing; perception
 auction system working well.
 didn't seem, certainly
 me--and wrong--to front end priority list
 
 terms intensive application new technology.
 MR. ANGELL.
 don't want debate questions
 point, think it's important marketplace
 
 public perceive we're sensitive open access
 bidding system really ought give lot priority
 making certain option available discussion
 
 takes place seen holding process.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 agree completely that.
 
 And,
 
 really--Dave working us this--we putting
 full court press that. don't want leave impression
 anybody fix that, we've fixed
 problems doesn't follow.
 MR. ANGELL. understand I'll happy
 time talk problems.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MR. MELZER. want make one follow-up comment.
 Thinking John [LaWare] saying--and prejudging
 ought come out--it seems one draw
 distinction violations auction process,
 Treasury oversees, decision respect primary dealers,
 choose deal execute transactions.
 seems me, getting back John's point, effect
 punishment--and maybe it's perceived appropriate
 punishment--that implicitly statement Fed making
 we're comfortable dealing people. imagine
 reaction be. "The Fed must know something
 don't know," say they're comfortable
 dealing [with firm].
 That's pretty serious statement, seems
 me. somehow distinction could made two
 issues--the Treasury bidding process role executing
 transactions--which distinction you've made before, think it's
 important one.
 MR. SYRON. one problem reason
 extensive discussion perceived--and think Ed's comment
 appropriate--correctly incorrectly many people
 appropriate sanction applier, use term,
 Federal Reserve. Now, it's done--and I'm
 judging one way another--then way, given
 happened, issue somehow defused it's clear
 sanctions Federal Reserve appropriate
 one [to apply sanctions] whoever appropriate
 doing.
 MR. MELZER. Yes, suspend auction
 process without pulling primary dealership; that's I'm
 saying.
 
 10/1/91
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. trouble, unfortunately,
 can't suspend temporarily primary dealer.

 Questions either gentleman?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Mike, really excellent opening

 MR. PRELL. think notion intuitive appeal.
 It's something one discern terms behavioral

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, related Ed Boehne's question.
 forecast incorporates usual assumption change rates,
 essentially make.
 going back looking
 forecasts historically, quite substantial change rates
 been. I'm wondering going forward whether
 think difference expectations rate changes
 economy done caused primarily external
 differences going real economy. That's one
 factor. much--and addressed somewhat already--is
 change responsiveness economy fall rates?
 It's impossible give precise weighting that, I'd
 interested speculation that, particularly going forward.

 MR. PRELL. Well, would discount entirely notion

 MR. BLACK. Well, think getting hand true state
 economy near-term prospects difficult
 time time I've ever involved it,
 I've longer would like remember. Much
 anecdotal information we've getting lately
 negative discouraging. course, positive news-especially manufacturing area--and similarly statistics
 pretty mixed. despite conflicting information, think
 staff made particularly strong case kind moderate
 growth they're projecting here.
 think it's important
 bear mind moderate [recovery]

 Real GNP, example, expected grow

 economic potential. So, happens, recovery

 one aspect recovery appear clear
 me, really, made substantial progress toward
 reducing inflation underlying trend rate inflation.
 staff's projection 3-1/2 percent rate late next year
 context continued moderate real growth seems pretty reasonable
 us. get 3-1/2 percent next year maybe 2-1/2
 percent 1993, think closing
 effectively price stability. Now, I'm certainly aware risk
 excessive monetary restraint could damage economy
 apparently precarious position could make
 difficult, impossible, achieve sustained price stability.
 So, definitely want exercise degree caution.

 clearly momentum reducing inflation rate now;
 credibility growing increase chances

 example, industries like chemicals poultry processing.
 Manufacturing inventories continue quite lean. Another positive
 note single-family housing inventories seem declining,

 declining there's evidence might actually stalling

 summary, seems Southeast--the Sixth District--is
 experiencing activity much like nation whole,

 national side, we're fairly close Greenbook
 forecast, show somewhat slower growth, particularly next
 year, somewhat higher inflation. agree recovery
 going slow; it's probably going pushed manufacturing.
 I'm somewhat concerned forecast--not forecasts
 generally--have bit optimistic reality hope
 upcoming forecasts prove little realistic.
 look overall characteristics economy nationally
 see is: modest growth consumption expenditures

 income growth; housing sector that's still adjusting slower rates

 financial side, still see weakness.
 It's true

 One way would
 [phrase] question confronting us financial side
 economy is:
 monetary conditions tight easy?
 pick
 indicators here. M2 conditions look tight, unprecedentedly slow
 growth M2. We've discussed issues there. would
 concern credit side less portfolio side.
 Ml
 growth continues look healthy; maybe tailed bit,

 related reliably economic activity. would suggest even
 reliability M2 relationship could called question.
 Look credit growth. Conditions also look tight; but, again,
 could demand.
 look interest rates, we've brought shortterm rates substantially, mentioned, looks
 like ease. course, it's real rates matter CPI
 inflation 5-1/2 percent 1990 looking perhaps 3-1/2
 percent 1992, real rates fallen less last year
 nominal rates.
 So, less ease would apparent
 looking rates. Real Treasury bill rates higher
 averaged long sweep history. 60 years
 real T-bill rate zero.
 Currently, it's probably 1-1/2 2
 percent, although probably marginally lower rate
 prevailed much '80s.
 It's roughly order
 magnitude '80s; course, '80s different
 environment, characterized growth credit demand.
 you're interested stimulus final demand, might
 look real rates paid final borrowers; perhaps matter.

 
 10/1/91

 think real rates faced bank borrowers, would still seem
 pretty high. Chairman Riegle pointed day,

 we've seen much easing rates real terms. it's

 seem financial system inherently tight
