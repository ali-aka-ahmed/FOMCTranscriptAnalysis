 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Kohn
 discuss [report] task force relationship
 discount rate open market operations. Don.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. summarize
 points briefly. First, task force noted recent history
 periods fairly automatic passthroughs discount
 rate changes federal funds rates periods number
 occasions part none change discount rate
 echoed federal funds rate. first regime tended
 prevail since late 1979; second 1970s. borrowed
 nonborrowed reserve operating target open market operations,
 passthrough tended automatic. open market operations
 geared achieving federal funds rate targets, discount rate changes
 often flowed decision discretionary;
 adjustment often basis point basis point.
 intermeeting ranges federal funds rate narrow,
 late 1970s, chances inconsistencies heightened
 passthrough became less frequent.
 Second, attempt resolve meant
 "pressures reserve positions" current directive. Clearly,
 FOMC mind specific federal funds rate level.
 Desk operates anticipation level achieved
 secondary thought given borrowing objective.
 time, Committee deliberately avoided explicit announced
 federal funds targets explicit narrow ranges movements
 funds rate objective intermeeting period.
 background, seems something
 said least fairly strong presumption passthrough
 discount rate changes many, most, circumstances.
 policy would retain one element fostered degree
 flexibility federal fund rates 1980s, avoiding
 rigidities became built system 1970s.
 Inconsistencies passing changes discount rates
 FOMC directive likely rare. Whatever information causes
 [Reserve Bank] boards directors vote change
 Board Governors approve change would usually also call
 adjustment directive. time,
 circumstances potential federal funds rate response
 discount rate adjustment would seem call discussion
 Committee. One circumstance might change
 discount rate intended show entirely; would
 involve adjustment borrowing objective. Another would
 full passthrough discount rate change implied especially
 large change federal funds rate Committee meetings.

 task force suggested enhanced consultation circumstances.
 possible, would include advance notice Committee members
 action contemplated opportunity thorough discussion
 alternatives. Now, I'd like give colleagues, Peter
 Sternlight, Karl Scheld, Virgil Mattingly chance add
 thoughts. think Peter things say.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. don't much add Don's summary.
 Clearly, discount rate anticipated funds rate tended
 move broadly together, think that's expected given
 responding similar sets information interpreted
 similar partly overlapping sets policymakers. paper tried
 strike balance presumption similar movement
 time recognition value flexibility
 discretion cases full uniformity size timing
 moves could questioned. Reasonable judgments may vary bit
 precisely one draws line strong presumption
 parallel movement. Consultation, course, need mean
 something parallel movement. It's opportunity
 review situation light additional information. That's
 add, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. thought gentlemen
 impossible job, best judge came
 best compromise one could conceive of. must say I'm still
 quite reluctant cave in, will, question
 nothing target federal funds rate. issue arises
 largely de facto targeting funds
 rate. I'm sure us believes that's right
 policy. think compromise recognize
 we're require enhanced consultation
 form Kohn suggested. probably would unwise
 go anything specific detailed
 reason start get rigid area, we'll
 publish exactly guidelines are, think
 probably would restrict capabilities somewhat. So, far I'm
 concerned, enhanced consultation notion strikes way
 come question manner brings together really
 statutorily two fundamentally conflicting forces. really
 operate discount rate independently open market
 operations, probably would get monetary policy less
 terrific. Indeed, think that's experience 1970s.
 possibly avoid find way come rigid funds
 targeting, think would ultimate solution
 problem. even though de facto day-by-day basis think
 targeting funds rate, longer-term sense I'm sure
 that's right. would say recent periods probably
 monetary aggregates targeting sense funds rate
 targeting, although operationally using funds rate
 target. Considering that, strikes me, frankly,
 [staff] committee come almost Solomon-like that's even
 conceivable kind situation. anyone else
 comments?
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, agree completely point
 federal funds targeting. I've felt long time
 needed find something else, preferably kind reserve
 measure, that's easy lot parts M2
 
 3/26/91
 
 reserveable proclivity financial markets
 innovating slap reserve requirements those. think
 need move direction, probably need little
 consultation we've had. problem memo
 didn't think authors necessarily suggesting
 consultation. think you've unusually good calling us
 together, one two instances wished
 gotten together didn't--the change discount rate
 right last Federal Open Market Committee meeting,
 example. One colleagues called said:
 "You know, you've
 disenfranchised vote." Well, happened agree
 move; one Reserve Banks sent [a
 request lower discount rate], didn't really feel
 disenfranchised. felt strongly [action]
 precluded FOMC determining federal funds rate,
 thought province FOMC. understand
 argument. So, would opt slightly consultation, think
 you've better anyone else ever providing that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Bob.
 
 MR. PARRY. Given current operating procedures,
 recommendation enhanced consultation makes lot sense.
 that, think concerns several us felt
 would much allayed.
 MR. GUFFEY. guess don't know term "enhanced
 consultation" really means. don't want define put
 stone, right ring sense don't think
 discount rate dominate open market activities
 intermeeting period vice-versa necessarily. result,
 require discussion frequent discussions;
 whether [enhanced consultation suggestion] implies
 isn't clear me. happen agree Bob Black's comment
 respect action taken last FOMC meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Lee.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. I'm sure "enhanced consultation"
 means. don't know means we're going take vote
 frequently. think issue clearly focused whether
 FOMC body sense authorized extent
 moves occurred. conflict, think,
 Board's view discount rate function was. find
 statements somewhat ambiguous, particularly read last page
 legal section states clearly--at least me-that authority monetary policy actions least respect
 group FOMC. That's way read conclusion
 page 9. seems somewhat inconsistent you're
 suggesting. Maybe Virgil comment that.
 MR. KOHN. would comment wasn't clear us
 deliberately attempt specify exactly open
 market operations meant. goes back ambiguities
 directive really [unintelligible].
 clear, think,
 1979 1987 open market operations aimed borrowed
 reserve nonborrowed reserve targets. Now, it's less clear. So,
 
 3/26/91
 
 legal appendix didn't really help much--it didn't help anyhow-in policy sense deciding ought happen.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. first reaction period
 1984 present things seem worked rather well terms
 balance that's there. Now, that's [using] assumption
 have, gives FOMC certainly decided power. FOMC uses
 borrowing reserve target kind, effect causes certain
 pressures [in reserve markets], makes funds rate move
 way relation discount rate. don't see
 anything inconsistent FOMC deciding would like
 funds rate approximately 50 75 100 whatever basis
 points discount rate. scenario, Board
 advice Reserve Banks changes discount rate, FOMC
 still last word sense could choose make
 adjustment spread discount rate fed funds
 rate. So, seems switching reserve targeting
 fed funds targeting, fed funds targeting could seen
 targeting [spread or] cushion fed funds rate
 discount rate. don't see infers new territory.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, indicated earlier,
 two statutory provisions surface least seem
 conflict. think would big mistake us
 get bogged jurisdictional questions here. all,
 Board [oversight] discount rate operation
 Federal Open Market Committee [have] objective,
 [requires] unified monetary policy. said that,
 obviously need preserve prerogatives areas.
 think needed here, since statutory provisions read
 somewhat conflict, bridge two.
 that's exactly [the staff report] suggested
 [enhanced] consultation. think really way get it,
 would urge us frequent consultations. ought
 get bogged rights Board versus
 rights Committee. think that's counterproductive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Tom Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. would agree Bob Forrestal said
 getting technical here; think could problem.
 would come out, sympathy Lee said legal
 side, discount rate action causes change
 instructions FOMC given Desk, simpleminded fashion it's hard technical sense let
 happen without consultation. practical matter fed
 funds targeting regime now. chosen say
 world. think it's bad public relations, basically, say
 doing, think it's right to; internally
 recognize that's doing. circumstances call
 greater consultation, less. So, problems
 expressed earlier Bob Black Roger Guffey
 exactly language means seems define
 little. really don't think could define specific rule;
 
 3/26/91
 
 circumstances we're operating right argues erring
 side consultation, less, effect we're changing
 instructions Desk.
 observation would make, Don, don't know
 interpret historical evidence but, look back
 couple situations happen remember quite well, generally
 we've done relate discount rate changes fed funds
 changes; one ever looked whether consultation took
 place. remember strict borrowings regime--for example,
 July August '86--there discount rate changes
 showed funds rate consultation
 FOMC. FOMC basically acted meeting ease policy
 recognized might effected discount rate change.
 I'm saying it's possible get would necessarily
 clarify things much, evidence
 sense right evidence.
 MR. KOHN. think instances middle '80s
 period went ways. Norm looked record
 last FOMC meeting found least one meeting
 Board acted right FOMC meeting another meeting
 several months later FOMC members discussion
 one last December's meeting. So, went ways.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Ed Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. think people paper
 pretty good job. technical divide
 up, think err, ought err side
 communication. last months we've seen [a case],
 last FOMC meeting, discount rate came
 meeting. clearly going rub people wrong way,
 although meeting FOMC essentially precluded
 Board needed do.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Board change discount rate
 day day after--I've forgotten worked. think
 we're going find kinds situations,
 way minimize unhappiness shows time time
 err side talking rather talking.
 MR. MELZER. One thought meant mention there's
 lot potential value added terms conveying technicalities
 interest one group versus another. think potential
 higher quality decision, even though may difficult
 get, consultative process.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 worked past.
 
 Well, think that's actually
 
 MR. SYRON. think enough said
 agree gist said communication.
 may technical question issue:
 may close to, effectively considered be,
 penalty rate many people affect implementation policy
 
 3/26/91
 
 Peter Sternlight? know we've discussion I'm
 directly addressing happened, I'm wondering proceed
 it's worth point someone crank something
 much issue concern Desk--i.e.
 relationship funds rate discount rate we're
 period we're now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter obviously confronted
 issue detail. Maybe wouldn't bad idea put
 said orally short memo circulate it.
 think it's
 interesting issue Desk-MR. SYRON.
 find helpful.
 
 Well, thinking it, would
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 something like that, Peter?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes.
 
 put together
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. SYRON. thinking go forward
 probably won't issue; comes again, would
 helpful know.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. raises issue Wayne Angell,
 floor, raised length.
 MR. ANGELL. I'm responding Tom Melzer's comment
 think Tom right heart it.
 turn operational
 paragraph. Now, maybe operational paragraph accurate
 regard we're doing. accurate, maybe ought
 change it. operational paragraph says Committee seeks
 either maintain decrease [or increase] existing degree
 pressure reserve positions. That's say FOMC doing.
 that, determining less gap
 discount rate fed funds rate rather level
 fed funds rate. Now, FOMC determining level
 fed funds rate, operational paragraph doesn't say that.
 Frankly, like operational paragraph is. think
 make work well way. that's is, FOMC
 sense determining fed funds rate; it's determining
 pressure.
 MR. BOEHNE. course, words like
 would wish case rather is.
 [Laughter]
 MR. ANGELL. thing discount rate, doesn't
 notion Board Governor's FOMC's posture
 that's important [unintelligible].
 really two policy
 tools. One subtle one. is, open market
 operations subtle announcement effect
 we're pegging fed funds rate. think us would
 prefer one tool subtle announced.
 tool announcement tool. never made much sense
 hit gong, make announcement, say nothing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 anybody else anything add?
 
 3/26/91
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. quick comment. basic view
 captured well Ed Boehne Bob Forrestal
 said. one added thought context enhanced
 consultation process, whatever means, think
 sensitive to. within framework so-called
 enhanced consultation mindful process could
 become counterproductive deteriorated people insisting upon
 formal vote FOMC every time consultation.
 think open flexible mind
 degenerated process--which don't think will--where
 ended frequent recorded votes intermeeting intervals,
 think would potentially damaging extreme could
 produce inertia problem monetary policy process itself.
 So, least perspective, spirit Ed Bob
 particularly said captures well. think
 mindful within process enhanced consultation
 need flexibility there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anything further? not, let's see
 implement way inclinations expressed
 memorandum various members Committee.
 we'll look back see whether we're
 right; not, we'll recalibrate feel
 comfortable. thought [task force] report help us

 MR. CROSS. Well, Mr. Chairman, move another subject:
 Questions raised level U.S. foreign exchange

 Let mention pros cons

 Also, would say that's one reason got heavy downward

 problems it's difficult say don't need $48
 billion, need $42 billion $55 billion. It's hard
 justify kind decision, seems me.

 MR. CROSS.
 
 Right.

 Governor Mullins first.
 
 MR. MULLINS. guess Ed getting wanted ask

 MR. CROSS. Well, say it's difficult know
 kind reserve needs may don't know

 high relative to, say, Germany Japan even Taiwan,
 course highest world. international
 standards level reserves shows us
 excessively endowed kinds comparisons. argue
 much United States have, given position, whether that's

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 somewhere, you've got go gut feeling. gut tells

 can. think $48 billion high side sense tells
 ought look opportunities lower number.
 don't know far ought lower lower number would make
 feel comfortable; doubt need $48 billion. So,

 would say:
 Talk Treasury reduce warehousing take

 MR. MELZER. Longer term, think need pursue that;
 international financial considerations people
 going taking shots profit loss statement
 don't really appreciate. So, think educational job

 problem us feel sterilized intervention doesn't
 really good yet we're caught sort international

 We're going answer today don't know

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let ask Sam question,

 MR. CROSS.
 
 Right.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 Yes.
 
 We'll try think one through.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. interim, unless
 misheard, minimum support trying edge

 MR. CROSS. Well, think Treasury sympathetic

 MR. ANGELL. There's one slight addendum discussion:
 reserve holding costs us money

 MR. SIEGMAN. want bring attention also,
 may heard, Congressman Gonzalez raised kinds
 concerns ESF Federal Reserve holdings. proposing
 fueling Congressional setting--tying accounts
 IMF legislation sorts problems here. It's much

 academic issue happens balances;
 political dimensions.
 May one word discussion?
 problem level balances disposal balances
 two separate items. discovered, even agree
 much, difficult sell except time
 dollar severe downward pressure. pressure
 direction, upward, side concerned

 least mentioned there's always room replenishment.
 It's two-way situation. one dispose certain amount
 feels one needs more, market situation right
 chance intervention acquire additional holdings.
 One final comment regard method sales
 whether it's off-market on-market: On-market sales equivalent
 intervention broader scheme things. affect
 market all, within certain time could neutralized; whatever
 effect same. off-market sales
 timing something interpretation whether

 MR. SYRON. One minor point though, Charlie. understand
 you're saying it's relevant something Governor Angell
 also Chairman said. sense time natural tendency,
 then, accumulate reserves. That's
 direction go in. cost holding them, presuming
 conceptual framework model this, completely
 symmetric sense least current arrangements
 borrow need to. Well, apparently can; know it's always
 possible, [but generally] borrow need get [foreign

 disposing get certain level. So, [leads
 to] judgment--I realize isn't precise--that proceed
 bias sell [balances] begin accumulate,
 given difficulty selling compared accumulating.
 MR. SIEGMAN. Well, Sam pointed out,
 sense victim historical accident. year really
 accumulated huge amounts--$22 billion--was 1989. Without
 numbers would look different, even adjusted $22 billion
 [down make comparable] years. So, year
 probably overbought.

 absolutely technical change reestablish [alignment with]

 MR. STERNLIGHT. think would. thought could put

 first point, though: realize others like

 even respect point make wanting see little
 use discount window, I'm sure see much

 MR. KOHN. But, Peter remarked briefing, it's
 technical thing. Part reaction markets

 MR. FORRESTAL. Let start District, may.
 We're getting mixed reports Sixth District. Considerably
 optimism developed, one would expect, ending
 hostilities Persian Gulf. Realtors reporting sales
 single-family homes picked February inquiries
 traffic quite strong far month. fact, spoke

 Trade show contacts report orders giftware strong

 Reports credit conditions suggest little easing

 District unemployment rate went 6.9 percent,

 Looking national economy, forecast
 revised lower since met last time. larger decline
 expected first quarter fully made rest
 year economy turns around. comparison
 Greenbook don't see expansion quite strong
 remainder forecast horizon. think rise consumption
 going proceed somewhat slower pace staff forecast,
 think demographic factors account good deal this.
 outlook prices basically different Greenbook.
 CPI rising slower pace 1991, don't get
 improvement time goes on. fact, pace CPI
 deteriorates bit forecast. similar Greenbook,
 however, show resumption growth sometime
 second quarter, certainly second half year.
 I'm little comfortable forecast six weeks
 ago, remain concerned much fragility
 economy. We've declines asset prices high debt
 levels; continued emphasis problems deposit insurance
 threatens erode confidence somewhat. recent rise confidence
 --certainly number [released] morning--is encouraging
 wonder much euphoria

 early morning, I'm concerned also estimates activity

 heard, seems we're dependent activity
 strengthening abroad well second half. Even though
 there's offset reconstruction demand Kuwait, may
 take time develop reflect need capital.
 So, summary, Mr. Chairman, believe forecasts
 impending turnaround fairly high probability
 right, I'm concerned still risks outlook
 side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we've moved slightly different
 direction Bob Forrestal think near-term outlook

 main reasons feel little bullish

 possibility we'll get.
 price side, particularly glad see
 staff lowered forecast inflation somewhat period

 pressures going move right direction result
 think wise monetary policy period several
 years now. think we're going hit pay dirt one.
 disturbed, course, rapid run-up consumer price

 special factors.
 I'd even concerned recent
 growth aggregates doesn't slow somewhat near future
 pace last couple months.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District economy
 shown signs strengthening recent months. California
 economy, contracted terms employment July
 December, showing positive signs. Although California
 unemployment rate rose markedly February, largely reflected
 sharp increase labor force. Payroll employment growth actually
 strongly January flat February. Moreover, anecdotal
 evidence suggests residential real estate market beginning
 recover coastal California cities. recent rains
 raised reservoir levels point drastic
 rationing plans softened. rest District
 appears avoided significant downturn. Twelfth
 District states higher employment growth rates national
 average experience much slowdown [seen
 
 -27-
 
 3/26/91
 
 elsewhere] following onset Persian Gulf crisis. Annualized
 payroll employment growth rates July January outside
 California ranged 2 percent Arizona 6-1/2 percent
 Nevada. Increased real estate activity also reported Seattle.
 real estate markets, adversely impacted last
 fall, remain stable. relative strength West reflected
 commercial bank lending. Although loan growth slowed, loan
 volumes continue rise. Total loans District's largest banks
 rose 7 percent February year ago compared 1.2
 percent rest nation. District bank real estate lending
 accounted much fast growth, increasing 10.4 percent
 level year earlier. Admittedly, result
 changing shares commercial banks successfully competed
 savings loans District.
 Turning national outlook, expect short recession
 moderate recovery especially war Gulf
 oil prices remained low. Specifically, anticipate
 economy much like Greenbook forecast output declining
 rate 2 3 percent current quarter recovery,
 would expect, midyear. sectors contributed
 fall-off final sales, namely consumer spending also
 residential investment, contribute recovery
 final sales. Retail sales housing starts reports February
 upsurge consumer confidence early March certainly
 consistent kind outlook. recovery
 view likely moderate historical standards, expect
 unemployment rate stay 6-1/2 7 percent range year
 decline gradually 1992. Temporary slack economy
 produce moderate decline inflation rate
 year next, Greenbook forecast. also expect
 increase fed funds rate required later year
 keep inflation flat declining path. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, sense something dichotomy
 District end hostilities arrival spring,
 Chicago always welcome event, combination
 two. think attitudes District quite significantly better
 time last meeting. Retailers,
 example, reporting significant increase floor traffic and,
 turn, improvement sales small ticket items. hasn't yet
 flowed big ticket items, small ticket items up.
 Auto dealers certainly significantly improved
 attitude. went December, January, February--a
 grim period--dealers ordering cars manufacturers
 rates lower retail sales level. reversed;
 ordering cars higher level retail sales.
 that's typical time year, nonetheless, think
 decided shift attitudes. attitudes seem
 better, specific numbers really don't line
 improved attitudes. District labor markets, example,
 weak. numbers compared favorably national
 numbers, we're seeing deterioration there. Claims
 unemployment insurance rising District, hunch
 numbers going begin take adverse comparison
 
 3/26/91
 
 -28-
 
 national average. We're continuing experience
 think unending series layoffs one plant another-100 people here, 200 there, etc. Specifically, auto industry,
 though outlook may improving, it's pretty grim levels.
 manufacturers talk reduced sales forecast
 full year again, 13 million units; course, that's cars
 light trucks. even number dependent comparatively
 good third fourth quarters. production levels auto
 industry second quarter higher first quarter
 still 10 15 percent lower last year. hear
 it, production risk auto industry still much
 side point.
 weaker auto situation reflecting steel
 industry. industry reducing forecast shipments
 year 77 million tons, 80 million tons
 time last meeting 85 million tons last
 year. One manufacturer, least talked him, producing
 70 percent capacity. order rate little higher,
 won't poorly inventory. Prices steel industry
 best stable low level. competitive conditions
 really very, tough consequence gone
 difficult profitability issues. pricing general
 District, far steel things, reflective
 that. Competitive conditions awfully tough items
 don't sense much upward pressure. heavy trucks, i.e. Class E
 trucks, category haven't talked much about, conditions really
 weak. Sales production year 25 percent
 last year; last year really good year. one
 major engine manufacturer, supplier heavy truck industry,
 currently running 30 percent capacity, really
 shut don't expect near-term improvement.
 fact, normally sell 180,000 units reasonably good year
 sales forecast year 110,000 130,000
 units; therefore, it's pretty depressed situation. Adding
 problem industry, major haulers
 tough time getting credit finance purchase equipment,
 exacerbates problem.
 machine tool industry bit brighter
 industries District. Sales backlogs little
 higher. auto industry go significant
 model changeovers next couple years, shows
 improved orders machine tools. Net, District context,
 hope going something transitional phase
 see improvement numbers following
 improvement attitudes certainly feel.
 national context, basic disagreement
 staff forecast, least pattern. think moving past
 low point here. expectation recovery
 bit modest staff forecast would suggest, least
 next couple quarters. personal consumption numbers look
 little high, particularly durables; turn dependent
 great deal auto industry, we'll see
 works out. So, look it, think moving
 transitional period, least moment risk continues
 bit side.

 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, considering meterological
 analogy, spring hasn't come New England yet either terms
 economy weather; snowing left yesterday.
 One would hard pressed call situation "mixed." think
 balance it's still pretty negative. glimmers hope;
 fairly significant improvement sales existing
 homes, consistent happening nationally. might
 expected, given prices probably fallen 20 25
 percent. survey auto dealers last couple days
 find going on. hope generated
 increased foot traffic sales point yet. Actually,
 dealers believe would get [increased] sales
 quickly foot traffic went up. manufacturing,
 strong point have--and might stretching call
 strong--is exports still holding up. even defense
 goods producers layoffs.
 hopeful sign may we're getting price
 wage adjustments. Actually work we've done indicates
 least New England historically really
 period substantial declines employment substantial increases
 unemployment reach threshold--and that's
 directions--that affects wage behavior.
 region employment decline, since local peak, somewhat
 greater 6 percent, makes weakest period decline
 New England peak not-yet-trough basis history. It's
 possible, don't monthly data, 1946 lot
 shipbuilding facilities closed war might
 much employment decline, that's far back one
 go.
 this, course, negative effect consumer
 confidence; flattening little still low.
 Retailers report soft activity lot discounting going
 on. construction--and something needed happen--the
 value put place somewhat 50
 percent. Financial sector problems still prominent news.
 expect addition Bank New England situation we'll
 another $20 billion institutions year
 resolved. total roughly size Bank New
 England hit consumer confidence. far
 credit crunch goes, don't think there's great deal
 improvement indigenous institutions. seeing
 entry nonbank financial institutions others coming
 market pick opportunities may there.
 interesting note fiscal problems state
 local governments. look either reductions
 expenditures going required likely tax
 increases, comes District-wide number somewhere
 order 2-1/4 percent personal income. add local
 governments goes 2-3/4 3 percent. So, think
 something going rolling toward end
 year effect consumption.
 think region least flatten two quarters
 national economy.
 
 3/26/91
 
 -30-
 
 far goes, find Greenbook conditional
 forecast next several quarters pretty persuasive.
 place may question basis [the inadequate]
 weight gives state local government [spending],
 Greenbook already pretty soft. looking across
 nation I'm sure going happen sector.

 MR. MELZER. District would agree something Ed

 something like current pattern exchange rates don't think
 unreasonable, think greater risk--and Bob Forrestal
 somebody already said this--on foreign growth side, looking
 right now. given tenuous nature
 outlook, situation margin make difference.
 Nevertheless, think case modest recovery sometime
 spring early summer unreasonable juncture.
 terms anecdotal reports, we're hearing things
 unlike number things others said. example,
 widespread gossip, put proper terminology,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. Well, interesting period
 observations issues. first question
 inflation fears: fears inflation reigniting
 reigniting? think economic logic clear
 supports opposite case, given increasing slack have; see
 signs trouble commodity prices movement dollar.
 Despite recent revival M2 growth, we're coming long
 period slow growth; seven past ten months, M2 growth
 less 3 percent. labor costs data, one
 toughest components inflation, behaving remarkably well.
 even inflationary expectations surveys somewhat.
 So, think everyone agree we're making substantial
 progress inflation. thing doesn't agree
 measured inflation itself, keeps chugging along apparently
 oblivious inescapable economic logic. We've couple
 pretty awful months stories especially postal
 rates excise taxes like. Many people would argue,
 especially special cases, government-induced increases
 part inflationary process. problem
 are. respond part increases labor costs
 also feed inflationary process. So, think it's
 little difficult ignore.
 markets may also getting concerned inflation.
 Long bond rates 35 basis points since last meeting.
 Board staff argues increase real rates rather
 inflation premium, point broad array market
 data consistent analysis, including stock market data,
 junk bond data, dollar, commodity prices. everything
 suggesting increased probabilities imminent turnaround. Even
 March 19th, CPI number released, housing starts
 data released day dollar went up,
 rather inconsistent lot fears inflation. people
 believe another reason long rate went
 notion turnaround also CPI numbers might keep
 us easing. Peter already talked bond market's
 reaction 1/4 point ease couple Fridays ago, March 8th.
 three stories think fair amount confusion:
 people said maybe gone far, least many
 people seemed say fact cut fed funds rate
 didn't cut discount rate signaled end
 easing. talk people street, there's still fair
 amount confusion exactly signal we're trying send
 fed funds rate top discount rate even though
 operationally may work okay. think compelling thing
 happened day, though, Michigan survey leaped
 20 30 percentage point increase. So, it's difficult make
 much that, I'm comforted market data say
 inflation control. troubling aspect
 look back seven years beginning 1984 see core
 inflation stuck 4-1/2 5 percent, makes
 one wonder whether short shallow recession really
 
 3/26/91
 
 -37-
 
 job. logic pretty persuasive one thing we're going
 face, get string these, bond market
 stop buying story start looking numbers. I'm sure
 we're prepared that.
 terms real economy, again, everything looks great:
 war over; oil prices low; consumer confidence back;
 money growing; markets signaling rebound. turn
 logic reality, need consumers willing spend
 bankers willing lend. share opinions expressed
 others we're seeing confidence go up, there's question
 whether stick even greater question sort lag
 confidence actual spending.
 side, confidence collapsed August, really couple
 months spending collapsed. doubt much faster
 side hill. Moreover, first national
 recession we've eight years. Many young working Americans
 never experience worrying job security
 wouldn't surprised, Governor Angell also indicated, consumers
 much like banks corporations don't step back spend time
 building equity returning old ways.
 true drags process, including unemployment
 situation. would also agree Dick Syron state
 local government situation; look across country,
 measures 28 50 states pretty severe problems. That's likely
 overhang. terms hard data, one thing clear:
 Americans celebrate victory buying new car.
 terms hard data, staring get uptick.
 Clearly, encouraging area housing. Even February data
 housing, course, could effect global warming
 warm February that's highly correlated
 thing housing starts and, guess, existing home purchases.
 see one potential problem, though, housing-led recovery.
 that's question whether banks finance homebuilders,
 don't think there's anyone else around it. many
 builders access commercial paper market. don't see
 insurance companies finance companies financing construction. And,
 submit, we'll find whether credit crunch not-whether it's demand side supply constraint.
 commercial real estate disaster fresh minds many
 builders financially weak bankrupt, capital-thin bankers going
 asked finance new round real estate development. And,
 again, logic looks pretty encouraging well. banks
 much better shape we've seen raising capital.
 haven't lending much yet; expect homebuilding
 play major role, pretty soon going existing
 inventories see whether get financing.
 One important piece evidence many people
 mentioned, consistent return normal conditions
 banking industry, growth monetary aggregates.
 looks finally engine money growth jump-started.
 may idling rate little high may need
 adjust choke bit. ten months slow growth, it's
 encouraging see pickup, question whether it's
 going little well.
 
 3/26/91
 
 -38-
 
 another factor weighs side
 growth aggregates that's behavior dollar.
 mentioned, since last meeting dollar trade-weighted basis
 essentially retraced ground lost war.
 stands middle last summer, though still
 heights last spring. view increase
 dollar something contractionary effect;
 weigh inflationary pressures reduce
 risks overly robust economic rebound. countries people
 view strong currency equivalent monetary tightening. Indeed,
 Charlie Siegman mentioned that, effect, equivalent
 increase interest rates offset would
 reduce rates. So, view increase dollar
 opposite situation August, September, October
 interest rates steady rising dollar falling,
 helped cushion decline economy. think
 opposite situation dollar viewed partial
 counterbalance concerns rapid growth aggregates,

 Greenbook assumes dollar fall back 11 12 percent

 look position U.S. economy political system coming

 Europe, Russia, rest Europe wired together

 So, summary, I'm pretty much Governor Angell

 MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm last leaf

 I've heard around here. think look

 observing recent weeks continue gradually lead

 Angell raised question saving rate. One way looking
 process often case periods
 get run-up existing home sales, turn
 engenders realized capital gains financed mortgage debt,
 turn creates funds surveys suggest go disproportionately

 income accounts show rise consumption without rise

 since we're starting saving rate probably slightly

 substantial part--perhaps almost all--of fluctuation GNP
 since fourth quarter gross motor vehicle products, meaning auto

 major elements gave us much deeper declines
