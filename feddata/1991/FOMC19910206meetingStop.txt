 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Questions Mr. Cross?
 
 couple, Sam.
 
 One is:
 
 happens
 
 don't renew it?
 automatically expire process
 FOMC set review annually?
 so, guess
 idea Committee endorsing kind activity.
 
 2/5-6/91
 
 MR. CROSS.
 Well, warehousing arrangements
 Treasury going back early 1960s.
 would seek
 legal guidance would happen time
 outstandings Committee authorize continuance.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 assume would run mature.
 
 MR. CROSS.
 assume so, yes.
 next ones fall due
 May June. Well, don't know legal position would
 be.
 warehouse facility, don't know whether
 would mean whole $4-1/2 billion would ended
 
 moment or-MR. MATTINGLY.
 term them?
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 would go according terms.
 

 
 Yes.
 terms them.
 
 MR. MATTINGLY.
 [Each] would roll according terms;
 would additional warehousing resolution.
 MR. HOSKINS. So, endorse recommendation $10
 billion, would essentially mean FOMC endorses
 activity warehousing?
 MR. CROSS.
 means FOMC endorses continuance
 facility maximum $10 billion, yes.
 MR. KOHN. FOMC authorizing warehousing
 annual basis votes this.
 MR. GUFFEY. Sam, what's magic $10 billion opposed
 $5 billion, example?
 MR. CROSS. Well, say, Treasury taken
 initiative acted bring amount outstanding quite
 substantially past period. always made point
 clearly urge would expect
 would continuation [facility] conditions
 change--and change--it would available
 quite promptly order continue warehousing.
 point conditions certainly look like that's
 way it's going; it's going way. We're process
 reducing foreign currency holdings.
 MR. GUFFEY. follow-up question:
 authorize
 $10 billion, it's them? don't trigger do?
 could anytime want take it?
 MR. CROSS.
 authorize $10 billion, typically
 act request providing warehousing. Now, obviously,
 adversarial relationship, far I'm concerned.
 It's something talk about, work on, deal

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 you'd like add?
 
 Charlie Siegman, anything
 
 MR. SIEGMAN. No.
 think Treasury's need

 uncertainties. Otherwise, we'd review emergency

 MR. CROSS. We've made clear Treasury many, many times

 required drawn down, reversed, times

 MR. CROSS.
 
 [Statement--See Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Sam?
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 question intervention activities
 respect mark, since that's currency involved
 intervention we've doing.
 presume supposed
 sterilized intervention. question really is:
 we're pegging
 rate like funds rate, know we're sterilizing it?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 think happens automatically, defer--
 
 MR. KOHN. didn't sterilize it, supply reserves
 would changed funds rate would different. So, think
 order peg funds rate, sterilize it.
 see
 funds rate basically determined supply demand
 reasons-MR. HOSKINS.
 Yes, you're sterilizing around funds
 rate around total reserves.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Either way think it's--
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 Total reserves think drives money
 we're trying get money grow. So, one worried
 slowness monetary growth, one might worry practice.
 
 2/5-6/91
 
 MR. KOHN. didn't sterilize it, would show
 presumably total reserves, interest rates, borrowing,
 whatever Committee targeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions Mr. Cross?
 
 MR. KEEHN. Sam, sense outlook

 there. precipitous fall likely continued
 downward pressure?
 MR. CROSS. Well, it's hard predict one never

 want [to comment]?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. don't think there's anything remarkably

 MR. PARRY. First, I'd like say presentation
 useful--particularly last exercise, quite helpful.
 I'd like press bit issue credit crunch.
 think understand characterized impact wonder
 would somewhat differently. look
 causes recession, higher oil prices, war, consumer
 confidence, or--as outside room might say--monetary policy,
 etc., would ordinal sense put credit crunch?
 would characterize it--as small, top cause,
 bottom one?
 MR. PRELL. Well, think credit crunch already
 work prior downturn. know, we've discussed
 course past year would characterize
 nonquantitative way significant huge effect. one
 could somehow embody GNP growth terms, probably would
 less percentage point--maybe much less that.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 rather other--
 
 MR. PRELL. reckoning, oil price shock--just
 direct normal type oil price change run econometric
 models--would larger effect end last year.
 think recent period [other factors had] much larger
 effect oil prices. Certainly point ought seeing
 turnaround terms oil price effect we'll seeing
 things train. even greater unknown
 [what] psychological damage done oil price change,
 probably summoned people's minds recollections couple
 earlier major shocks followed recessions. suspect
 created many people's minds specter rising unemployment
 on. also war aspect situation, may
 positive factor people's thinking, though
 must say historically--for example, Viet Nam war--it's
 entirely clear people become grossly negative
 expectations sentiment increase military
 activity. sense big plus
 sentiment. last fall debacle budget.

 think back period, we'll remember appalling
 spectacle was; probably least short run
 rather devastating effect people's assessment whether
 government Washington really handle economic affairs.
 haven't seen concrete evidence financial fragility
 failures banks stand factors people's
 thinking; think negative, too, consumer
 sentiment. top this, we've fiscal restraint modest
 degree train while. things cumulate
 considerable damping effect least economic growth.
 oil price change war think put us negative
 territory. That's crude [analysis].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 alternative export forecast:
 Would

 MR. PROMISEL.
 
 Well, $15 billion, take $9
 
 billion net exports something order of-It's something 1/4 percent [on] real GNP.
 MR. PRELL.
 But, Larry pointed out, assumption stick
 
 previously assumed monetary expansion path. wanted
 offset that, would raise money stock growth let interest rates
 fall would offsets exchange rates
 effects interest-sensitive sectors economy. So,
 would large shock difficult offset
 moderate policy adjustment saw coming.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 Bob.
 
 MR. MCTEER. guess striking thing real
 GNP forecast abrupt turnaround current quarter
 next quarter. notice Chart 13 1/3
 inventory investment and, since happens next
 quarter, assume that's intended inventory investment rather
 involuntary. makes think inventory investment going
 strong next three quarters?
 MR. SLIFMAN. First, turns second quarter
 still actually liquidation going rate
 liquidation slower first quarter, GNP
 accounting sense shows positive number here. do,
 however, start get accumulation beginning second half
 year. amounts accumulation very, small
 dollar terms. Again, it's swings rapid
 liquidation slower liquidation small accumulation GNP
 terms winds adding real GNP. really
 trying show preceding chart, Chart 12, see
 even part projection period still GNP
 final sales rises gradually. think
 it's modest amount inventory accumulation takes place;
 fact, inventory/sales ratio that's consistent
 actually falls basically flattens
 historically low levels.

 MR. PRELL. Well, second quarter there's actually

 little uptick federal spending, it's 2-1/2 percent.
 point state local [spending] well taken. fact,
 we've lowered projection state local real purchases

 assumes probably decline construction spending--an area
 really surprisingly strong last year. We've

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Lee Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 I, too, want compliment staff
 professionalism objectivity presenting interesting
 report.
 one question respect longer-term averages
 present here. naive uninitiated person--nobody
 table, course--could read saying baseline
 [policy] average 2-1/4 percent [real growth] 5 years
 easier monetary policy, pro-inflation policy,
 average 2.6 percent.
 So, long periods time looks like
 pro-inflation policy rapid money growth, we'll
 higher rates real growth. simply doesn't seem [happen]
 longer periods time.
 presume answer 5
 years isn't [a long] enough time period.
 MR. PRELL. different way look there's
 aggregate supply function aggregate demand function.
 monetary policy keeps pushing growth aggregate demand
 faster aggregate supply support, we're going end
 accelerating inflation. that's message
 intended convey. lot dynamics period

 that's,
 
 think, interpretation data. Obviously,

 MR. KOHN. Right. It's view, expressed
 Bluebook, could get either [unintelligible].
 However,

 you'll note get 1995 finally, lower

 real interest rate houses right pretty darn high.
 falling real estate market--when one expect house prices

 Finally, assumption exports really going

 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, support alternative I,

 three ranges would give us ample room conduct policy might

 locked alternative I. raise ranges, would
 send bad sign market relative inflation [credibility];
 if, hand, lower them, would send bad sign
 economy relative desire help check recession.
 Therefore, feel comfortable actual policy guidance effect
