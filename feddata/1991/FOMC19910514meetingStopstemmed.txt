 substanti product level second
 quarter last year. shift first
 second quarter, product sens industri go
 less drag gnp first quarter; inde,

 close project staff privat
 economi. mike suggest bit stronger, seem
 remark close, someth mani peopl
 might view alarm given record forecast past.

 might on except believ thei're right
 thi. believ risk error equal
 side side. guess import question
 ought ask is: great risk
 big error side? word, like
 get significantli greater declin current quarter
 staff expect follow perhap greater
 declin third quarter? obvious, can't rule
 entir; absenc total unlik, unexpect
 neg suppli shock last august, probabl
 kind declin seem pretti low. we've alreadi

 beyond that, we're see new sign life residenti
 construct, strength stock market

 so, suggest probabl
 near bottom recess. whether it's go longer
 whether it's near trough, don't know. seem

 particularli glad see staff reduc inflat
 forecast felt time follow
 wise polici [cours of] action would pai term
 inflat number. staff cut coupl notch
