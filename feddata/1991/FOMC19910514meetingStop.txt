 MR. SYRON. Mike, inventories:

 MR. SYRON. makes little hard tell exactly

 Something kilter.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. One reasons weakness second
 quarter pickup nonfarm inventory liquidation.
 look
 know terms sales industrial production,
 admittedly sketchy, think it's possible would say
 likely could actually see pattern seemed
 developing first quarter continuing second? is,
 could actual inventory liquidation turn less second
 quarter first?
 MR. PRELL. Well, think put finger problem
 saying anything great conviction point:
 don't
 much data. We've looked orders try see beyond data
 recent months industrial production. don't
 know great deal flow coming abroad going
 current production; that's unknown. basically reached
 conclusion one consistent thought plausible
 final demand picture sensed going terms
 production. Also, think certainly sectors desire
 achieve lower inventory levels. And, I've noted,
 third successive quarter substantial inventory liquidation.
 recession entered supposedly pretty lean positions, we're
 ending total absolute dimensions inventory liquidation
 that's pretty much ballpark previous cycles--not relative
 GNP simply '82 dollar terms.
 So, maybe upside
 risk, don't think there's great desire accumulate
 inventories time.

 MR. PRELL. Let correct something.

 back mind, thinking data

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Again, relative GNP decline?
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Yes, especially since lesser GNP
 
 decline.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 would like start?
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, conditions District remain
 unchanged last meeting. remember come
 early phases somewhat better areas
 country, data caught us, current level
 activity Midwest, think, much reflective national
 conditions already perhaps even little weaker. may
 tentative signs improvement, nothing specific suggest
 reached turning point.
 think tell Mike's comments, it's certainly
 true District, critical area focus auto
 industry. District show real-side improvement
 see sustained pickup level retail auto sales.

 first second quarters essentially complete now, 1991 model
 year really big disappointment. forecast total
 sales full year pulled 12-1/2 13 million
 units even reduced level quite dependent upon
 good improvement sales third fourth quarters.

 though car inventories retail level really quite low
 
 5/14/91
 
 point, dealers still reducing orders substantially.
 time last meeting reported orders retail
 dealers excess within sales level. turned
 around. dealers turned quite negative ordering cars
 80 percent current sales level, that's, course,
 unusual time year. part, dealer attitudes
 based fact many losing money;
 point something like 50 percent dealers loss positions.
 Despite this, given seasonal factors course, production
 second quarter going quite bit depressed
 levels first quarter. Still, higher level production
 substantially production levels second
 quarter last year. shift first
 second quarters, production sense industry going
 less drag GNP first quarter; indeed,
 might something positive effect. final comment
 auto industry, certainly would say enormous first-quarter
 losses Big Three experienced cast big pall
 Detroit area.
 Many sectors District impacted
 auto situation. steel business, example, one CEOs

 telling business was, term, "rotten."
 currently operating 70 percent capacity. forecast
 shipments year reduced 85 million tons last
 year 76-77 million tons year. reduced level,
 20 percent going export markets; course,
 sales little margin, there's much profit there.
 suppliers auto industry equally hard pressed.
 parts District also fairly weak time
 it. Construction activity, example, continues fade.
 Construction contract awards substantially last
 year; March awards level something like 26 percent
 last year's level. people concrete business say
 experiencing something free fall.
 positively [for prices], though, news
 agricultural sector really quite good, mainly reduced
 level exports. Corn wheat prices [downward]
 pressure; that's going hold farm income. Nonetheless, think
 inflationary sense ought good. Due heavy rains-we lot rain Midwest--planting 10 days
 late. really good problem, bad problem. People
 talk say planting conditions really excellent.
 it's certainly far early judge outlook crop
 production, least point looks pretty good.
 Also positively inflation front, based talking
 people, think price outlook continuing improve.
 Competitive conditions marketplace awfully tough. Price
 increases very, difficult sustain. people
 keep track raw material purchases say
 experiencing little price increases raw material purchases.
 CEOs, looking ahead, still don't expectations
 they're going experience big price escalation.
 Net, national context may well reaching
 turning point, certainly don't yet see District.
 
 -7-
 
 5/14/91
 
 perspective within District improvement going
 dependent auto sector--an improved level sales following
 end model year production--and also increase exports.
 Certainly point objectives seem agonizingly
 elusive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Black.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think staff's downward
 revision projection real GNP second quarter makes
 sense light incoming information. generally,
 overall profile they've predicted next three four
 quarters strikes us eminently reasonable given staff's policy
 assumptions, behavior leading indicators,
 pattern recent anecdotal information. It's interesting
 close projections staff private
 economy. Mike suggested bit stronger, seems
 remarkably close, something many people
 might view alarm given record forecasters past.

 might one except believe they're right
 this. believe risk error equal
 side side. guess important question
 ought ask is: great risk
 big error side? words, likely
 get significantly greater decline current quarter
 staff expects followed perhaps greater
 decline third quarter? Obviously, can't rule
 entirely; absence totally unlikely, unexpected
 negative supply shocks last August, probability
 kind decline seems pretty low. We've already
 taken lot insurance prevent thing happening,
 cumulative policy actions last six months so.
 beyond that, we're seeing new signs life residential
 construction, strength stock market
 leading indicators, recent upturn National Association
 Purchasing Managers' index, higher April
 lowest quarter trough previous full economic upturn.
 So, suggest probably
 near bottom recession. Whether it's going longer
 whether it's near trough, don't know. seems
 significant weakening decidedly unlikely.
 particularly glad see staff reduced inflation
 forecast felt time followed
 wise policy [course of] action would pay terms
 inflation numbers. staff cut couple notches
 inflation projections year next year they're
 predicting core rate inflation 3 percent end
 1992. think ought least degree progress
 inflation. important keep mind
 staff assumed made projections,
 we'll come close achieving midpoint target range
 M2. think it's critically important take whatever steps
 required keep M2 somewhat range case recovery
 consequently money demand turns somewhat stronger
 appears us might be.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District employment
 statistics become bit weaker since last meeting, although
 District whole continues outperform rest
 nation. March state Arizona reported month-to-month
 gain employment District. However, declines
 District's states follow several months relatively robust
 employment growth. Employment levels still 1.6 4.8
 percent higher year ago District states
 California. would compare, think, fall 1.2
 percent rest nation. California's economy slowed
 nation. Since last July employment fallen nearly every
 month; April state posted first year-over-year decline
 level employment 0.4 percent. Durable
 goods employment continues fall, led declines aerospace
 electronics.
 think losses gains Atlanta
 District.
 Construction employment fallen level 8
 percent less year ago but, interestingly, real estate
 sales prices picked up. matter fact, median
 price residential real estate California
 previous peak.
 effects California's economic slowdown, combined
 growing structural problems state's budget, resulted
 projected $12.6 billion deficit end next fiscal year.
 Tax receipts low rather obvious reasons: weak sales,
 weak consumer spending, also unexpectedly low corporate bank
 profits. time, case loads health area, welfare,
 especially prisons risen sharply, mandatory cost-ofliving adjustments increased required expenditures.
 time Governor Wilson proposed [reducing] deficit
 1.5 cent sales tax increase--the tax right 6 percent
 higher based upon local initiatives--elimination COLAs
 programs, shifting state services counties,
 although one figure counties going get
 money finance this. end difficult say
 governor adamant changing income taxes.
 far national outlook concerned, view
 different Greenbook. slightly slower
 economic growth bit less inflation. expect economy
 roughly flat current quarter think real growth
 probably average somewhere 3 3-1/2 percent range
 second half, little weaker actually Greenbook.
 Next year, look growth slow bit 2-1/2 3 percent.
 It's clear main sources expansion easing

 One interesting story fits going

 Nationally, find Greenbook forecast plausible

 Greenbook forecast. matter fact, think it's good

 little over-optimistic timing second-quarter
 forecast considerably stronger have, although second
 half year really comes same.
 So, it's simply [a
 difference in] timing. scaled back second quarter
 scaled back bit before. But, balance, it's
 good forecast think one make, it's believable
 forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, forecast
 first:
 profile least similar Mike's, although

 quite strong--especially second half year.
 certainly [we expect] respectable recovery six-quarter
 period. Mike mention several areas uncertainty. One
 reasons recovery less robust staff's net
 exports; staff essentially net exports plateauing
 $20 billion deterioration built entire forecast period.
 don't lot confidence forecast think Mike
 made point earlier could go way.
 marginal terms area great uncertainty forecast period.
 difference 0 +20 0 -20 terms kind
 growth rates we're talking inconsequential.
 Another point I'd mention forecast--several people
 mentioned it--is state local sector context
 underlying thrust fiscal policy probably restrictive side
 well.
 state local [data] kinds smoke
 mirrors it's hard know real picture is.

 it's hard dismiss possibility could greater
 measure difficulty there, especially problems
 pervasive. darn states certainly major cities
 don't seem pretty hefty fiscal problems. Again,
 smoke mirrors makes lot harder judge difficult

 they're going expecting much recovery. may
 thinking traditional recoveries. guess it's
 still going difficult environment
 business. point amused Alan St. Louis

 anything bad since '74-'75. subsequently, seen
 first-quarter earnings, another increase--maybe record.
 So, people like tell us tough is.
 numbers themselves, noted before,
 positive information we're receiving mostly anecdotal isn't
 numbers. District it's starting show
 numbers first quarter. actually nonagricultural
 employment growth about--not quite--a 1.5 percent annual rate.
 Manufacturing still weak; that's primarily transportation, autos
 aircraft. nonmanufacturing services,
 strength across board contribution

 first positive quarter nonresidential construction

 broader basis, one comment want make
 inflation question. I'm somewhat troubled hear comments
 see press good reported inflation numbers.
 say press, mean comments market observers--I don't
 associate Jerry saying better reported
 price numbers short run--that somehow gives policy room
 move. two reactions that. One think numbers
 we're seeing result actions taken many months ago,
 years ago. sense don't think justify

 declines unacceptably high levels somewhat lower
 think longer-term context still unacceptably high levels.
 I'm saying policies we've put place long

 I'm hopeful economy pretty much

 continue things bother me. Paralleling
 Mike did, list moderating influences strength

 commercial real estate two factors.
 I've added financial
 fragility--although maybe retire one--higher unemployment,
 state local government problems, higher dollar, weaker foreign

 So,
 weight moderating influences becoming bit heavier.

 collapsed pre-war levels, two-and-a-half months since consumer

 consumer spending grow nearly fast projecting
