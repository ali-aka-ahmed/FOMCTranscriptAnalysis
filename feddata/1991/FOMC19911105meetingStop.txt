 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions?
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, two questions.
 fair say,
 looking probability distribution forecast now,
 still would consider negative tail fatter, even
 revision?
 MR. PRELL. Given direction things going,
 gut reaction say "yes." think also tail isn't
 quite long thick before. said, we've done
 essentially realized risks perceived
 earlier [by lowering forecast] think risks may
 somewhat balanced forecast before.
 MR. SYRON. clarification question: say
 putting together [forecast] Greenbook changed
 procedure regarding assumption funds rate would
 be? recent confirmation?
 MR. PRELL. That's right. strategy normally take
 prevailing funds rate neutral base projection.
 looking funds rate path, though, economic
 forecast judgment strayed farther perhaps
 Committee's objectives one might like terms presenting
 reasonable framework discussion. Indeed, unemployment
 rate end next year might shade higher
 currently rather level have. returned
 procedure used past putting policy
 adjustments try get closer something thought would
 acceptable Committee.
 
 11/5/91
 
 MR. SYRON. Well, thought useful.
 question came it, sense:
 Since assumed 50 basis
 point cut, essentially-MR. PRELL.
 
 That's correct.
 
 MR. SYRON.
 --and gotten 25 basis points
 far, consider forecast centered,
 leaving previous question alone tail, another 25 basis
 point cut?
 [Would be] answer compared another 50
 basis points?
 MR. PRELL. Right, obviously 25 basis points
 fine reading. [the thought] went with.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Looking forecast get beyond
 next two quarters, short rates certainly would considered
 acceptable, think.
 seems one things
 changed rather dramatically thinking regard inventory

 wonder could comment reached
 conclusions because, clearly, previous thoughts

 MR. PRELL. Well, two things, would say. One

 MR. PRELL.

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, actually, they've running low,

 MR. STERN. second question: reaction

 MR. PRELL. Well, Janet Norwood called attention

 MR. KELLEY. Mike, substantially lowered forecast

 MR. PRELL. Well, wouldn't want leave impression

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, incorporated forecast

 always uncertainties, Gretchen said,
 end playing terms fundamental competitiveness

 So, certainly looseness translation

 certainly easy sketch scenario weaker that.
 It's also possible sketch scenario stronger either

 stronger picture others currently thinking about.
 there's [uncertainty] sides, I'd say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 One
 MR. MELZER. two questions, Mike.
 don't know whether
 layoffs quarterly earnings announcements.
 ever look that, often two actions might linked.
 possibility spate bad news gotten
 job front terms certain layoffs simply seasonal thing
 associated announcement third-quarter earnings?
 MR. PRELL. Well, suppose could something there.
 may managements
 sense ongoing story.
 feel ongoing negative earnings reports require action
 convince security analysts going repeated
 future. people noted seem lot
 layoff announcements pertaining fourth quarter
 cuts tradition business laying people
 Christmas. sense lot restructuring going
 industry recession revealed need costcutting order get reasonable profit margins environment
 inflation going offset looseness management.
 There's sense, too, layoffs occurring places
 people thought jobs fairly secure.
 undoubtedly adds feeling among many people would seem
 face pretty good shape even could
 vulnerable structural adjustment seems going on,
 particularly service-producing sectors.
 
 11/5/91
 
 MR. MELZER. second question relates statement
 made real interest rates.
 general matter I'm somewhat
 skeptical ability really set time.

 case, surprised hear say felt
 considerable scope reduction. I'm curious
 you're measuring that. look took would indicate
 ex ante basis using, say, [unintelligible] CPI 3-month
 Treasury bill rate, we're beginning get levels that,
 sustained, associated '60s '70s periods rising
 inflation.
 wanted expand could.
 MR. PRELL.
 think that's fair statement. rough cut
 made, looking short rates, perhaps conjecture
 inflation expectations might viewed little less tenuous
 thinking 10- 20-year horizons.
 assessment shortterm rates come considerably. One calculation looks
 similar general level 1960s.
 point really
 relates cyclical stage typically reached toward end
 recession real rates quite regularly decidedly
 negative. point is, though, perhaps wasn't movement
 tighten soon enough expansion progressed avert
 building inflation pressures.
 isn't say sharp
 move sort suggested might necessary order achieve
 Humphrey-Hawkins central tendency rate level want hold
 long period. might well need move back
 within year so.
 historically, lows cycle don't
 look like lows seen short-term real rates
 previous cycles, certainly postwar period.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 Tom.
 
 MR. HOENIG. May ask follow-up Tom's question?

 described economy, fundamentals terms real
 estate adjustments leverages forth going
 constraining.
 ease now, judgment risk
 pushing inflation [up] compromising ability bring
 future, given fundamental adjustments probably
 continue regardless?
 MR. PRELL.
 real estate easier factor consider.
 leveraging gets little difficult pin down--i.e.
 whether firms really cutting back investment
 debt loads.
 There's anecdotal evidence would suggest
 that, don't know powerful force is.
 see
 significant amount restructuring going on, firms
 leveraged hilt able
 current environment reduce interest burdens alter
 debt/equity ratios ways ought give little
 room maneuver. think real estate problem going
 time weigh strong surge
 economy. fiscal policy picture--just total setting aside
 current budget program--will remain less stimulative,
 course.
 So, things [appeared] past
 recoveries early expansions aren't going
 time. higher growth rate, lower unemployment
 rate; less slack economy, greater risks
 you're going make kind progress toward lower rates
 inflation forecast. even might
 
 11/5/91
 
 So,
 cut entirely get strong enough [trajectory].
 risks one weigh point whether economy
 going prove weaker acceptable whether inflation
 must say
 rate might stubborn we've anticipated.
 seems lot skepticism among forecasters outlooks

 period--say, getting 1993.
 decline inflation stopped become meager
 people sensed economy solid growth track.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Mike?
 not,
 Bob Parry.
 would somebody like start Committee's discussion?
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, economic conditions Twelfth

 turn national outlook, data we've

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Could ask Mr. Parry question?
 
 Sure.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Bob, past weeks I've
 heard couple people, including really large national real
 estate developer, sounding dire real estate outlook
 West Coast California particularly--much
 anything I've heard before. anything that?
 MR. PARRY.
 
 commercial real estate area is.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Yes, is--
 
 MR. PARRY. think focus southern
 California, particularly Los Angeles, there's quite serious problem.
 Vacancy rates quite high they're going rise next
 year awful lot building coming
 line next 12 months. Another area Orange County,
 suffering well. two areas significant enough make
 general picture state regard commercial real estate
 look quite negative. look areas, San
 Francisco, it's nearly bad. put moratorium building,
 kept building moderate levels last several
 years; don't see [area] problem. point
 [situation in] residential real estate quite different
 commercial. Residential, least terms prices,
 held quite well, although clearly sales new houses weak.
 It's problem.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, District signs
 weakness developed since last meeting. Attitudes
 certainly deteriorated. Anecdotal reports coming much
 negative side. always, auto sector major swing

 District employment moved sideways since April; it's

 Sales new existing homes District
 declined quite substantially housing starts dropped

 Plant closings District--and I'm talking
 temporary shutdowns permanent closings--are continuing
 seems disturbingly high levels, announcements day-in

 Offsetting may seem like gloom,
 bright spots.
 steel business, example, something
 mystery.
 industry running 80 percent rate [of

 Though steel companies expect cancellations

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think best descriptive
 term use Sixth District economy "quite soft," although
 still signs recovery there. Several

 manufacturers added inventories intentionally. Activity
 export side continues fairly good, although it's
 little been. Textiles improved, we've also
 seen evidence new capital projects.
 Retailers,
 hand, reporting flat modest increases sales.
 Caution consumers, course, much minds
 very, pessimistic fearful Christmas season;
 don't expect business good all.
 Tourism business

 overriding statistical data economy
 anecdotal information, continues very, poor
 indeed quite worrisome. Everywhere go business
 meetings even social affairs--cocktail parties on--there
 real sense doom gloom. fact, went two functions

 describing business terrible dismal, words kind.
 Interestingly, though, ask lot people think
 lower interest rates would help business help economy
 generally, don't get uniform answer "Yes, [the Federal

 course, continuing concern job loss, concern consolidation

 inflation side, there's evidence price

 agricultural side looks fairly good probably

 confidence issue
 perplexing me; I'm confused doesn't

 So, guess question need

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK.
 seems obvious us District
 people think everything pessimistic; whether they're consumers
 business people, [they have] low expectations. particularly
 striking [example] came last meeting, joint meeting
 Baltimore/Richmond boards, heard pessimistic
 statements economic conditions think I've heard 36
 years I've attending meetings. virtually
 reports we've gotten since along line.

 sense aborting asset price adjustments doesn't help
 much. Asset prices need adjust different level

 Another fact long cycle consider
