 Overall construction activity remains strong, recent

 improved moderately September October, sales gains
 District generally matched slightly exceeded

 electronic goods soft. District retailers generally expect
 reasonably healthy holiday sales season, shorter sales

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, activity regional level
 District, elsewhere country, decelerated pretty
 much across board. particular, residential construction
 recently softened noticeably. recent monthly surveys,
 though, suggest bit rebound lately service
 manufacturing sectors. sense despite
 deceleration, sectors still relatively firm overall,
 exceptions like textiles apparel. addition, labor markets
 region remain tight according information have,
 wage pressures still evident least local markets,
 although elsewhere conditions produced

 general, think fair say households

 Finally, employment growth moved back closer trend

 seems remain high. According information see,
 labor markets still quite tight. Greenbook, all,
 still projecting modest steady increase ECI
 projection period also core CPI, especially abstracting
 reweighting index. So, again, think risks
 remain weighted side. Also, even though upside risk
 seems diminishing somewhat, see precious little
 margin error direction. still high level
 activity, see significant increase aggregate
 demand near term, could get us back trouble
 hurry. So, bottom line, need remain vigilant.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. BOEHNE. Economic activity Philadelphia District

 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, many us indicated last
 FOMC meeting still waiting forecasted hopedfor slowdown economy, time
 scattered signs slowdown. think case
 longer. Indeed, Sixth District exactly mirror
 national economy, many trends seeing within
 District appearing national economy well.
 District economy continues grow moderate pace, although
 longer would suggest leading nation. Signs
 slowdown beginning appear, particularly residential
 construction manufacturing. Tourism, mainstay District,
 particularly Georgia Florida, continues extremely strong.
 Retail sales exceed year-ago levels, retailers talk
 optimistic upcoming holidays. real estate contacts
 report single-family market begun slow, albeit
 historically high level, sales construction activity
 flattened October. time, multifamily commercial
 construction continue strong. Loan demand remains steady,
 consumer loan demand described flat commercial mixed. Banks
 region tell us beginning pay closer attention
 credit quality.
 labor market front, continue get reports
 localized shortages, fact becoming common
 across District. time, hearing
 scattered wage pressures and, Mike Moskow Cathy Minehan
 indicated Districts, almost signs
 tightness passed consumers form higher
 prices. get reports direct impact
 increase minimum wage, business contacts
 indicate certain wage contracts indexed minimum wage
 hence watchful front.
 outlook District calls moderate-to-strong
 growth well next year. look signs possible
 slowing due diminished demand. Although consumer confidence
 remains strong, see slight drop willingness buy bigticket items. regional decline loan quality suggests
 possibility tighter loan standards weaker loan demand
 future. Similarly, regional capital investment may slacken unless
 manufacturers stop revising capital expenditure plans downward.
 national front, see things
 everyone else does. reported drop third-quarter GDP growth
 recent monthly data seem signalling slackening
 looking for, especially light evidence
 growth consumer spending business investment may slowing.
 Despite evidence slowing expansion, still expect
 forward momentum continue good level,
 economy's fundamentals remaining essentially healthy.
 see three key question marks forecast, essentially
 discussed Greenbook. first concerns
 consumer demand specifically pick much.
 think upside risks here. Al Broaddus noted,
 personal income up, savings up, debt burdens
 reduced slightly October, run-up stock market
 given consumers' holdings financial wealth added boost.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions David?
 not, let get started. far see, outlook
 little changed time last meeting.
 outlook may shifted toward slightly slower growth,
 margin within expected range statistical error.
 data difficult read, labor markets
 unquestionably still quite tight. suspicion
 measures labor costs may biased downward third quarter.
 impression reasons
 raised around table.
 First, don't think enough data verify
 hypothesis national level, clearly shows micro
 level sense that, tight labor market,
 wage increases take form promotions. Consequently,
 get grade updrift show fully wage structure,
 essentially ECI represents. Compensation data
 suggest grade drift may addition real
 drift toward truly higher skilled workers.
 also question average hourly earnings
 October, know came zero. think staff
 also demonstrated quite credibly industry-by-industry
 correlation average hourly earnings average hours
 significant. implies overtime component
 data. significant decline average weekly hours
 October, adjusting would raise October average
 hourly earnings number something like .2 percent.
 big change, think data giving us benign look
 wage structure probably exists.
 also issue side whether
 acceleration entry-level jobs suggested anecdotal reports
 offset increase number people leaving labor
 force, largely retirement. sure whether wage
 rates retirees rising, wage rates
 older workers higher average, ratio
 rise. rate retirements high enough overcome
 general aging remainder workforce allow us
 
 11/13/96
 
 -30-
 
 readily reconcile higher entry-level wages still sluggish
 structure wages overall.
 Another issue variable pay question raised
 earlier Gary Stern. surveys beginning show
 proportion workforce, still relatively small, wages
 significantly related profitability company results.
 means issue applies much broader group sales
 workers. important issue extent
 big wage increases consequence of, tied to, profitability,
 increases necessarily inflationary. true
 costs go relation prices, profit margins squeezed
 wages automatically start adjust down. So, may
 true wages commission sales workers slipping
 relative average, reason numbers nonsales workers gone somewhat more, may partially offset
 higher wages increasing proportion workers
 salaries tied closely profitability.
 see bottom line wage
 structure extraordinarily dynamic easy read.
 thing know sure--or precisely information
 fairly accurate--is total wages salaries, probably average
 hourly wages salaries well one prepared argue
 data hours worked bad. effort isolate
 structure things misplaced merit increases compa
 ratios kind thing, important
 understanding wage increases stemming from, really
 difficult. Therefore, think quite careful. also
 careful productivity data,
 reasons mentioning previous meetings relative
 bias price indexes like, also
 significant changes quality hours worked
 adjust for. deficient understanding true structure

 part yet achieved. [Laughter]
 merely suggest

 though, seems incremental data since last

 better inflation performance. would consider perfectly possible

 comfortable watchful waiting.

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.

 next quarter. unemployment 5.2 percent,

 want poised asymmetric side toward tightening. would
 take, example, two three quarters growth 1-1/2 2
 percent range get unemployment rate moving back toward
 5-1/2 percent, arguably means acceleration pressures
 resources inflation. So, think asymmetric
 exactly right thing do, frankly think going
 quite see signs
 going removing inflation pressures economy quickly.

 Finally, Governor Meyer.
 
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation
 change policy. Indeed, given recent data suggest
 
 -38-

 risks become balanced, comfortable supporting

 still think major risk inflation begin rise
 next year. asymmetric directive reminds us importance
 remaining vigilant face risk, therefore
 support proposal retain current policy posture.
