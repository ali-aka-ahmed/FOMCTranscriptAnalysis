 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, minor suggestion one
 changes preliminary draft minutes
 received last night.
 It's paragraph 13, talked Mike
 Prell this.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. FISHER.

 MR. BOEHNE.
 Peter, couple questions
 planned changes Desk Operations. understand this,
 operations customer accounts operations System
 account. understanding correct System operations
 going announce amount bids
 accepted?
 already announce size customer transactions,
 side understand correctly announce amount
 bids looking amount accepted?
 MR. FISHER. Yes. historic practice
 continued. Now, may gone far explaining this,
 think likelihood customer operations may die vine.
 want announce never another customer
 operation, hard pressed see circumstances would
 tempted it.
 MR. BOEHNE. question focus primarily
 customer side. advantages disadvantages
 System operations announcing amount bids
 looking for?
 MR. FISHER. Yes, think pros cons
 announcing quantity advance. pro telling
 market amount contemplated operation normally thought
 helpful.
 con like look dealer appetites
 one indicator funding needs, rather uncomfortable
 situations announce $1 billion customer
 operation get many bids $2 billion,
 rather typical.
 saying amount bids always
 double, rather common. amount dealer bids
 financing actually helpful piece information assessing
 amount reserves think may need inject.
 focused increasingly day-to-day operations much
 reduced operating balances related uncertainty, size dealer
 bids become variable growing importance.
 accept
 principle would better announce size intended
 System operations, makes somewhat uncomfortable
 like see dealers' appetite indicator may lead
 view,
 shade size operation one way another.
 announcing size contemplated operation becomes problematic.
 MR. BOEHNE. seems like reasonable tradeoff.

 planning go earlier, presume way
 station entering market still earlier information
 becomes available, opens possibility, maybe
 likelihood, come market
 day.
 
 12/17/96
 
 MR. FISHER.
 
 explained memo.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Yes. kinds things look
 for--you talked some, could elaborate--in
 deciding whether go market second time? look
 reserves; look funds rate; look both;
 sense put hands market get feel?
 happens?
 MR. FISHER. Well, since Desk
 kind habit going market multiple times day--I guess
 twenty years so. certainly hands-on experience
 multiple daily operations. Among things would look would
 unexpected shift Treasury balance could big
 factor would become aware later day. drain
 reserves rise Treasury balance information
 available us, would unexpected shift funds drain
 stemming customer operations. first order
 flows would become aware degree certainty.
 Another reserve factor certain relates
 occasions, hoping avoid, get add much
 reserves wanted to. Then, would nice,
 shock market process, able come back conduct
 operations get enough bids first time.
 another sort fact, certainly.
 harder issues funds rate stays
 firm and, current environment operate day,
 left wonder early afternoon whether made mistake.
 talk brokers funding desks find something
 going wrong; sometimes determine reason, funds
 getting trapped bank wire transfer problems.
 bank may continue wire transfer problem throughout day,
 adding little reserves could helpful situation.
 think sort issue look at. Kohn
 talked length last couple years.
 really rather hopeful for, still even off,
 way able operate truly late day, is,
 3:00 p.m. 4:00 p.m.--which would require change Fedwire rules
 perhaps window--or even later 6:00 p.m.
 certainly
 would information number factors would
 know whether reserve miss could try respond
 it.
 MR. KOHN. would better sense demand
 reserves late day. think one phenomena
 low reserve balance situation, least couple years ago,
 things could shift rather dramatically terms demands
 excess reserves late day. think many central
 banks operate day, particularly
 interest rate target, would nice flexibility.
 MR. FISHER. So, terms new framework conducting
 operations, think multiple operations one day would used
 infrequently would available us. So, whether operated
 9:30 a.m. 10:30 a.m., would option coming back
 11:30 a.m. became aware something tangible

 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. vein multiple interventions
 day become commonplace, think would helpful
 Committee see analysis that. thought
 lot, one things worries little presumption
 among market participants going there,
 creates disincentive maintain proper operating balances.
 MR. FISHER.
 would like echo concern.
 agree
 would want Committee discussion. also
 quite worried jump quickly multiple daily
 operations, actually reduce incentive intermediation
 fed funds market. Clearly, incentives
 declining. reserve balances come sweep accounts
 taken hold, less juice system individual
 bank desk treasurer intermediate market,
 incentives coming down. careful
 reduce incentives behavior. means
 intervening think market really working,
 something looks broken.
 MR. MELZER. Overall, think
 responsive developments marketplace, applaud steps
 taking. So, supportive that.
 One suggestion
 would make, Peter, talk dealers moving
 earlier time Desk operations, might want telegraph
 statistical system support it, going
 want go still earlier time.
 give idea
 ultimately want get terms timing first
 intervention day. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guynn.
 
 MR. GUYNN. Peter, talked expected performance
 gains. say anything magnitude gains
 going earlier?
 MR. FISHER.
 MR. GUYNN.
 
 terms bids?
 quantitative sense that?
 
 MR. FISHER. Well, last couple weeks,
 observed, operated number times 10:30 a.m.,
 part responding firm conditions funds market large
 need worried might enough bids cover.
 statistic tip tongue, don't--I
 think almost routinely saw something like doubling amount
 propositions dealers operated 10:30 a.m.
 
 12/17/96
 
 rather normal time 11:30 a.m. Now, whether
 function surprise value market
 knowing looking fill big needs, could sort out.
 But, clearly, seen substantial improvement amount
 propositions going one hour earlier.
 MR. CHAIRMAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. also applaud moves direction
 greater transparency. think kinds things
 doing. also taking away one piece information,
 better worse, stemming use customer RPs. way
 used past Desk help estimate reserve
 need. got wondering, go step further?
 pros cons actually telling markets
 rolling projections reserve needs period are?
 reason think would create adverse incentives
 part banks?
 MR. FISHER. thought quite bit pros
 cons providing sense reserve forecast. Clearly one
 sense, would provide modicum certainty, soon
 thought realize provide modicum
 certainty. forecasts really quite movable feasts,
 start end analysis it. One things
 come realize forecasters work
 actually valuable telling probability
 distribution forecast error. is, side
 think errors likely be? actually
 useful bit information whole exercise.
 think way want lean
 basis utility function. Now, would impossible
 communicate market unless sort shading
 forecast.
 leads back start analysis.
 look whole issue transparency, whether Committee's
 transparency policy transparency operating market,
 think two things need clear.
 case objective simple: told target rate
 5.25 percent. operations
 transparent. process drives decision-making little
 fuzzier little harder communicate, particularly
 going shift market behavior associated low operating
 balances heightened degree uncertainty. much
 greater confidence accuracy forecasts turn
 relevance two-week forecasts day-to-day volatility
 market today, would leaning side
 reporting forecasts. given
 uncertainty relationship two-week forecasts
 day-to-day demand reserves, really quite squeamish it.
 So, think definitely pluses minuses, pros cons,
 is-MR. JORDAN. understand errors daily
 forecasts stem principally unexpected changes Treasury
 balance, factors float get way accurate
 forecasts. course, kind uncertainty exists way

 understand that. worked Desk!
 fact, isn't case Bank England, may intervene
 number times day, puts number amount
 mind?
 MR. FISHER. Yes, do, think raises
 interesting question. one-day maintenance period.
 decline reserves balances operating balances System led
 us conclude two-week maintenance period becoming
 irrelevant--it look like going happen
 trend even though certainty it--then think
 would come back think hard operating
 de facto one-day maintenance period basis. would decide
 much money banking system needs day. Bank England
 one-day maintenance period 3 4 windows every day
 may operate. announce forecast
 shortage day, decide whether provide money
 not, whether enter market immediately later day.
 one-day horizon, much intermediation across
 time, something think would want encourage banks
 do.
 get point, rethink quite
 number things. one-day horizon gives rise questions
 target be, forecast itself, whether, given
 implications incentives President Melzer pointed out,
 operating multiple times day ongoing basis.
 MR. JORDAN. presume would take away
 intra-period gaming see going on.
 agree completely Tom
 Melzer need kind discussion, would suggest
 include consideration flexible

 MR. FISHER. Absolutely. Kohn benefit

 MR. BROADDUS.
 Peter, get little better handle

 trouble hitting

 MR. FISHER. trouble. point,
 would like bring analysis forward Committee;

 raw data used calculate effective rate,
 currently look day standard deviation that.

 Interestingly, even though high year

 show volatility, cover last two years.
 longer perspective, volatility year still well
 experienced 1991 early 1980s. One would expect
 early 1980s, course, relevant look
 broad sweep. So, observing developments, would like
 bring analysis forward Committee point.
 people work wonder whether shouldn't publish daily
 standard deviation along effective rate. issue
 thinking about, bring back Committee.
 MR. KOHN. Peter, table front
 shows this.

 So, really

 generally consistent surveys depicted Bluebook,

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, forecast suggests may

 However, would seem little reason take action
 now. Bank, consult two monetary policy rules starting
 point thinking appropriate stance policy:
 estimated version Taylor's rule nominal income growth rate
 rule. Even assume 2 percent target core CPI inflation,
 rules suggest funds rate left 5-1/4
 percent present time, although applied forecast
 suggest higher rates needed future.

 addition, appears us least considerable
