 MR. PARRY. Mike, core rate inflation forecast
 increases 1/2 percentage point first quarter year
 fourth quarter next year. one assume
 unchanged policy extrapolate 1998,
 think would happen core inflation 1998?
 MR. PRELL.
 1998, economic growth would remain essentially
 around trend unemployment rate around 5-1/2 percent.
 judgment core inflation rate tending rise gradually
 perhaps would continue 1998. think
 far beyond NAIRU, would mean gradual trend
 direction inflation.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Moskow.
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Mike, want go back grain prices. One
 trend aware percentage processed food
 costs stem grain content come down--quite
 markedly, actually, last twenty years. wondering
 whether econometric models use take account
 also sensitivity food prices changes grain prices
 
 5/21/96
 
 look ahead period grain price increases

 MR. PRELL. well aware calculations show

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Isn't inflationary effect related

 grains small, know breakfast cereal prices went

 MR. PRELL. Perhaps. think need see happens

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Except impact export
 markets, wheat essentially become disassociated rest
 economy, whereas corn major input food chain-actually, corn, soybeans, soybean meal. Wheat used key
 factor twenty thirty years ago, isn't more.
 MR. PRELL. underscores that, know
 something good chunk year's wheat crop, know
 little corn soybean crop outlook. making bet,

 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. Mike, turning supply shock

 stable unemployment stays 1997, granted

 talk little unemployment labor market side?
 MR. PRELL. take suggesting take
 given projected output path look beyond that. year 1995
 
 5/21/96
 
 still something mystery. essentially stable unemployment face low GDP growth. One possibility GDP
 growth mismeasured. One hint have, mentioned
 previously, looking addition income side one
 would conclude GDP grown percentage point

 MS. MINEHAN. Maybe it's tone Greenbook,

 MR. PRELL. think brings back question

 MR. PRELL. recognize that, new current

 factors could changed, don't enough evidence

 salt.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. mentioned GDP income side
 almost full percent higher. suppose big surprise
 comes from?
 MR. PRELL. Well, can't say surprise
 point to. suppose relative forecast one thing
 happened last year got lot growth profits.
 don't see line corporate profit reports, but,
 certainly, things evolved last year one factor
 surprise. Basically, significant swing statistical
 discrepancies, gets reduced, whether it's

 think find somewhere in-between little toward

 MR. LINDSEY. thinking report Treasury

 would filibustered much did. would like start
 Committee's discussion? President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, monthly indicators model
 suggests economic growth current quarter close
 first. believe relatively high growth
 rate temporary reflects building inventories
 business firms. Thus, see economy slowing toward long-run
 growth trend 2 percent second half year, assuming
 interest rates remain near current levels. expect 2 percent
 growth 1997 well, slightly Greenbook
 forecast.
 forecast attractive might appear
 first glance. problem economy operating around
 full employment, difficult make progress getting
 inflation rate down. fact, structural model suggests
 small amount upward pressure inflation
 period, course Greenbook says well. find
 forecast alarming would like situation
 inflation rate projected come gradually.
 Moreover, seems downside risks
 worried earlier year dissipated risks
 largely upside now. Economic growth could easily come
 forecast. instance, structural model predicts
 slowdown second half year, part recent
 rise long-term interest rates. However, given market's
 expectation future economic activity embedded long rates,
 may appropriate treat recent rise rates
 indication future robust economy. Since already operating
 high level resource utilization, growth trend even
 quarters could present upside inflation risk.

 close come it. Others like set goals

 Secondly, working vision opportunistic

 19 different people coming it, believe may learn something

 also think need start least structure.
 case don't think it's critical whether use 1998-type goal
 push goal little time. start
 structure process many questions
 raised around table suggested, least me,
 lot difficult issues involved here.
 might agree favor price stability, need
 get beyond general notion decide price stability means
 and, practically speaking, go implementing it,
 timeframe, forth. difficult questions.
 get even difficult really start contemplate
 them, seems ought get feet wet somehow.
 proposing strikes reasonable way get started.
 see kind issues surface; see learn
 this; may see address issues like
 opportunistic versus deliberate approach disinflation.

 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. don't disagreement
 recommending, think done terms one sets

 [Laughter] Don's proposal gets us closer it, it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 discussion?
 
 Would anyone else like add
 
 MR. BROADDUS. agree Gary Stern. think
 nice initiative. view, it's important start somewhere,
 glad suggested put
 table. also agree comments, though,
 sense think focusing fairly unstructured way 1998
 way go. believe need longer-term horizon.
 would also suggest, Don, staff needs put structure
 kind policy discussion long-term
 policy deliberations. form usually takes set
 alternatives. simulations degree already,
 thinking something would structured terms
 goal. might beg questions price stability is,
 that's okay need confront one way another
 case. may little specific, might useful,
 say, horizon runs year 2000, flesh
 might interpret opportunistic strategy certain kinds
 assumptions might mean terms price measure
 like CPI. Perhaps another alternative, might add something
 little like traditional inflation targeting
 specific numerical goals, year year. kind structure
 might allow us get little quickly questions
 really need grapple.

 MS. MINEHAN. wonderful quote Ed Boehne
 research paper got opportunistic strategies. went along
 lines: Well, are; sooner later
 recession; don't want recession; work things
 way takes advantage inroads made
 inflation hold line next cycle, achieve
 pattern every cycle lower rates inflation
 previous cycle, even cycle peaks. operative
 definition opportunistic strategy, raises issue
 whether sit say, okay, year 2000
 anticipate least one recession made
 inroads inflation made last recession.
 Therefore, goal year 2000 2 percent inflation rather
 3 percent. find level precision difficult deal
 with. need discussion mean price
 stability. price stability goal mean holding line
 taking advantage opportunities get inflation lower,
 mean forward-looking policy drive inflation
 implies measure it. lot issues
 talking discuss inflation
 measures. know lot problems CPI.
 number going look say achieved victory?
 It's part discussion, think need it.
 don't know whether us giving specific number
 incorporating lot different assumptions "X" year
 way start. need start talking this, though.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. agree President Minehan. think
 useful discussion. generally prefer openended, longer horizon goal, starting discussion
 important. need kind discussion
 price stability means time horizon talking about,
 gets us started thinking 1998, that's okay me.
 preference would base discussion longer-term horizon
 1998, think getting started important.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 President Parry.
 
 hope two discussions.
 
 would
 
 set aside question strategy discuss sometime later
 think two different approaches strategy raise lot
 issues. So, confining discussion goals
 objectives time period achieving would
 useful.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. think discussion would quite useful.
 starting number doesn't strike way it.
 ought broader discussion issue price stability,
 mean it, get there.
 think
 substantive discussion, numbers fall out.
 reverse order, think end heavily philosophical
 
 discussion.
 
 So, support notion discussion
 
 focusing substantive question, would leave issue
 numbers later date.
