 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. explain arbitrage

 arbitrage transaction; double positioning.
 MR. FISHER. Right. thought it, think

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let ask another question
 perhaps Ted Truman. Four six months ago, whenever new data
 total German economy released, general view
 data poor quality appraised
 cautiously. subsequent view whether data

 MR. TRUMAN. still putting data
 warnings could continue time.
 number changes statistical systems incorporating

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's better central bank!
 
 MR. TRUMAN. thought clever myself. eliminated difference French German inflation
 rates!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions Peter?
 
 MR. MELZER. want ask Peter sweep accounts.
 Looking aggregate numbers, introduction accounts
 accelerated markedly January. sense far
 phenomenon played banking system?
 continues, longer-term implications respect
 reserve market? Obviously, reducing required reserves making
 holding excess reserves self-defeating.
 MR. FISHER. afraid think go good bit
 further. Beyond that, don't know anything
 scientific offer you.
 MR. KOHN. right, President Melzer.
 accelerate January also December. keep projecting
 adoption sweep accounts simmer little,
 another large bank large bank holding company chain decides
 adopt reserves effect grows even faster. note
 banks compensate much holding excess reserves,
 although may happen short run adjust,

 think order 15 percent average. So, total

 questions
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, question weakness
 economy experiencing present time. look
 quarterly projections Greenbook, would appear
 weakness current quarter temporary related
 extent weather. characterize future
 quarters end 1997, period would actually show
 above-trend growth average. think good
 characterization forecast?
 
 -6-
 
 1/30-31/96
 
 MR. PRELL. think would characterize growth
 average quarter close trend
 perceptibly different.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 That's fine.
 
 MR. PRELL. forecast suggest recent
 weakness likely transitory phenomenon. terms
 available information, weakness highly concentrated,
 effect, manufacturing sector, producers moving quickly
 gear production effort reduce inventory investment

 drag inventory investment return trend growth.
 presumes final demand reasonably well maintained

 addressed colleagues looking key

 baseline policy assumptions keep economy
 
 MR. PRELL. judgment. careful
 suggest, would say come close knowing
 relationships precision would want pinpoint

 see point, real funds rate currently looks bit
 historical average seems reasonably balance risks
 foster sustained economic growth pace close trend growth.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mike, quick question
 fourth-quarter projection. pointed out, total production
 worker hours reported fourth quarter
 third quarter. know data don't move lock step,
 get significantly stronger GDP result third
 quarter projecting fourth quarter.
 mark fourth quarter down? mainly anecdotal
 information?
 MR. PRELL. close end projection
 process, rely heavily anecdotal information. Toward
 end process, received PCE estimates October
 November big chunk total expenditures.
 estimates suggest strong PCE contribution,
 reinforced anecdotal information leading us discount
 somewhat seeing hours data. Looking
 behavior unemployment rate another labor market indicator,
 
 1/30-31/96
 
 essentially stability rate third fourth
 quarters, would broadly consistent trend growth
 output. Thus, 2 percent growth seemed reasonable place be.
 went solely anecdotal information, might inclined
 write lower number. retail sales data received
 morning would trim couple tenths projection,
 things equal. think reasonable ballpark,
 point range possibilities clearly wide.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. things taken account, struck
 fairly benign forecast compare
 rhetoric lot sources. also struck
 comment going rely anecdotal information,
 would written lower number. feel way also. Yet,
 look data, still mix looks pretty
 strong. referring housing data, auto sales don't
 look bad despite production cutback, personal income
 looks fairly good even though consumption bounced around
 bit. sense people seem talk negatively
 things really don't look bad?
 MR. PRELL. always dangerous judge things
 anecdotal information, though sometimes information provides
 early sign development can't perceive yet data.
 lags experienced recently getting data,
 think may look anecdotal reports little
 closely might usually. statistical side,
 indications trends unambiguous,
 surprisingly weak. Looking housing indicators, recent
 pattern single-family starts sales particularly
 robust. spurt summer slight
 softening home sales November.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Permits bad, though.
 
 MR. PRELL. Permits look little better. hopeful,
 looking loan applications on, uptick
 train, temporarily interrupted snow. Looking
 trend capital goods orders, pointed time
 moderation growth aside computers. So,
 think even data show hints deceleration. felt
 along coming appropriate Committee
 concerned overshooting noninflationary levels resource
 utilization.
 people sour point? people
 surveys University Michigan Conference Board
 noted reports felt possible bad
 weather adverse psychological effects. also point
 layoff announcements, seem picked last
 months large corporations. AT&T announcement particularly
 striking. disarray closing federal government,
 affected hundreds thousands people directly, may left
 people unsure kinds stimuli coming federal
 sector. factors may played role, recent downturn
 confidence measures comes several months slow

 consumption growth. So, hard pressed point anything
 tangible explain moderation. guess
 one reason effect giving weight possible
 indication financial distress time stock market
 booming. latter certainly indication someone
 feel insecure.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. Historically, recessions
 stock market going up. would astonishing see
 much weaker picture without softening stock market.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mike, mention motor vehicles
 January, perhaps weakest these.
 MR. PRELL. anecdotal reports industry quite
 weak certainly tend offset report spurt sales
 December. averaging that, still would come
 moderate sales pace quite consistent trends
 place while. rule downside
 surprise, course.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 gentlemen?
 
 questions
 
 MR. STERN. question Dave Stockton relating
 Chart 17. concerns issue compensation labor market
 tightness. middle panel, make adjustment that,
 understand red line correctly, raises help-wanted advertising
 index. would think implications deepen
 mystery bit. chart seems suggesting that,
 adjustment, help-wanted advertising somewhat greater would
 measured otherwise, would seem put pressure
 compensation got.
 MR. STOCKTON.
 MR. STERN.
 
 Indeed sense.
 
 understood say reverse.
 
 MR. STOCKTON. meant imply looking
 unadjusted help-wanted index, black line, might helped
 solve mystery. One might looked concluded
 many fewer vacancies point time.
 MR. STERN.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Given view probably become
 less reliable indicator, made adjustment increased use
 personnel supply agencies. right; sense,
 adjustment resolve mystery. adjusted index
 little highs reached late 1980s, much.
 MR. STERN.
 
 Right, thank you.

 One view sales lost due bad weather

 later weather clears up. Second, seem detect

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Four-wheel drive vehicles doubt!
 
 MR. MOSKOW. No. Sales light trucks strong
 along. Obviously, cars sales area real

 MR. PRELL. It's clear made move reduce

 MR. MOSKOW.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. perceive earlier expectations

 Let turn Greenbook. know whether

 acceptable objective price stability. Either
 different model current assumptions
 going produce result want, cave
 price performance acceptable. Kohn's presentation
 December meeting opportunistic framework policy--where
 Committee waits something happen--is positive note. last
 time break inflation trend--from 4 percent
 underlying trend rate prevailed 7 8 years 3
 percent trend rate--was 1991. staff break analysis
 says inflation 3 percent trend since 1991. sense
 talking people, staff particular, reading
 1990-91 period indication time
 break imminent. sometime later could say
 trend broke operating 3 percent inflation rate.
 tentative evidence could already early
 stages another break, going know while.
 Even though central tendency members' inflation forecasts

 range, Board staff projection 3 percent,
 discourage much might normally. That's

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. wanted talk
 Cathy Minehan's perception people feel grumpy

 distribution assets debt--particularly distribution
 assets--does look like issue rich poor, don't think
 issue rich poor right way look it. look
 within income class, get different picture
 distribution assets. Within class, asset holdings highly
 skewed. thrown poor rich income
 classes problems interpreting those.
 look, example, $20,000 $30,000 income class
 distribution interest income within class, top 4.7 percent
 got 60 percent top 13 percent got 79 percent interest
 income received class. So, matter that, broadly
 speaking, $20,000 $30,000 class assets. course
 do, assets concentrated handful people
 within income group. thing true
 income scale. $50,000 $100,000 income class, top 8.4
 percent taxpayers got 70 percent interest income received
 everyone class. Again, asset ownership concentrated
 sorted income factors. Age probably one
 them.
 add up, get surprising statistics:
 1.9 million low moderate income households incomes
 $30,000 got $29 billion interest income. 16.5
 million households earning $50,000 received, including
 making quarter million dollars. Sorting way
 not, mind, overcome fact capital income
 unequally distributed. happens unequally
 distributed ways would show total income.
 would like focus, particular, column 5 chart

 might mention first calculated financial position
 delight actually financial assets greater
 non-mortgage debt. Perhaps pass information

 Finally, Humphrey-Hawkins meetings give us chance
 focus little specifically progress toward longerterm price stability objective. couple quick thoughts
 that. fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, CPI

 Greenbook projecting inflation move slightly
 3 percent 1996 1997. also projecting
 general pattern core CPI two-year period.
 Obviously, would huge setback, would move
 wrong direction would mean couple years without
 progress toward longer-term objective. Also, study
 numbers carefully, think beginning see faint,
 nonetheless discernible, signs firming wages labor costs.
 couple points relating firming noted reading
 Greenbook: increase average hourly earnings 2.8
 percent 1994 3.2 percent 1995. may evidence
 economy operating neighborhood NAIRU without
 lot head room. Also, noticed Greenbook projecting
 3.1 percent increase employment cost index 1997 compared

 impending setback longer-run efforts bring inflation

 Questions Dave?
 
 MR. PARRY. question velocity: think
 market would assume confidence forecasts velocity

 MR. D. LINDSEY. don't think market's view

 monetary aggregates. essentially accepted FOMC's
 analysis 1990s heightened degree
 uncertainty regarding velocity behavior. So, don't think would

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, idea
 ranges mainly communications device guides me. Since
 Humphrey-Hawkins report testimony doubt point
 find monetary aggregates particularly
 useful policy tool, adopting Alternative I, II, III would
 result strong market reaction great excitement except perhaps
 corners academic community. However, time
 still easing mode--certainly last move Committee
 easing action, whatever today--I think using
 Alternative would best communicate long-term goal price
 stability. So, alternative definitely prefer.
 majority Committee prefer alternative,
 something would get excited certainly
 would object dissenting. think Alternative conveys
 message reliably.

 like start us this?
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although retaining
 M2 target range 1 5 percent gives signal longerterm objectives, view need something
 communicate fully public markets. think would
 desirable supplement monetary targets kind

 suggestion would include HumphreyHawkins written report hopefully testimony, Mr. Chairman,

 describe publicly, sort benchmark. would

 public, matter ourselves, something concrete

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. long time, ever,
 consensus emerges success failure monetary targeting
 last 20 years so. far aware,
 central banks around world experimented monetary

 successful German economists outside Bundesbank also argue

 trying it. would rather see Committee say,
 without Mack legislation, adopted single objective

 way achieving objectives Full
 Employment Act. even sure requires legislation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, expressed views topic
 before, know think ought moving direction
 setting longer-term inflation targets. would disagree
 said Mack legislation.
 information would suggest prospects passage
 legislation really tested, see merits
 waiting see happen legislation. However,
 approach July meeting nothing happening sense
 legislation going anywhere, think ought
 considering steps could take without
 legislation. purpose would convey clearly
 longer-term objectives and, Al said, increase credibility
 accountability.
 mentioned yesterday, one step could taken
 regard, short actually setting target, would extend
 horizon respect inflation forecasts. It's ironic
 CBO OMB put budget projections inflation assumptions
 going five years. assuming 3 percent inflation
 horizon. view, projections generally tend
 impact longer-term inflation expectations, agency
 actually influences inflation time doesn't anything say
 it. Obviously, one could take point
 projection becomes target. certainly relationship.
 would think carefully doing,
 would see real problem impediment decision
 Committee provide forecasts longer time horizon.
 forecasting inflation two three years out, people would realize
 time horizon could influence,
 might expectation would deliver that.
 pick Cathy's point, Jerry touched
 little, don't put much faith model projections inflation.
 Part reason take credibility account.
 Nonetheless, found interesting look model results
 Bluebook. fascinated examples assumed
 shocks raised equilibrium funds rate 50 basis points.
 conclusion, underlying assumption, current
 future funds rate 5-1/2 percent consistent 3 percent
 inflation long run. One could argue easing funds rate
 today would analytically equivalent example Bluebook
 upward shock equilibrium funds rate of, say, 50 basis
 points. suggesting anybody favors easing
 mind. interesting, one believes model
 output, reducing funds rate really put one
 opportunistic school, think people would tend
 favor policy course would likely place themselves. Rather,
 actually places deliberate camp raise inflation.
 effect example, real equilibrium funds rate
 shocked, drive inflation rate higher; continues rise

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
