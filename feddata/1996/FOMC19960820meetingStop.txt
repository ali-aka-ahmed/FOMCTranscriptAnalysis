 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter, think aware

 MR. FISHER. tried systematically segregate

 Yes, will.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. may remember

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, share view

 MR. JORDAN. Okay. Then, concerning happens two years

 Good.

 MR. BROADDUS. going make basically point
 Jerry Jordan did, Mr. Chairman. understand timing problem

 well.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. memory subject strikes short
 coming meetings long,
 struck number times notion "strike" appeared
 factor underlying analysis Greenbook, particularly
 Part II. references strikes ended

 whether principal effect strikes much near-term

 impact people's perceptions relative power labor unions
 versus management despite decline membership labor unions

 seems great deal concern whether Wall

 expense workers' standards living. So, wondering whether,
 even strike immediate inflationary impact,
 potential affect even nonunion relationships labor
 management may significant going forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would depend strike came
 out, whether, example, significant management victory.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes. fact strike occurred,
 think, something is-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, wonder. clear
 me. significant strikes past evident
 union defeats damping effect labor unions. example,
 flight controllers' strike, quashed,

 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, think environment

 MR. JORDAN. question, Mike,

 six-quarter projections nominal spending associated

 MR. PRELL. nominal GDP change small

 MR. PARRY. Mike, revisions Greenbook forecasts

 comment likelihood slowdown forecast

 MR. PRELL. think enough slowdown
 forecast relieve inflationary pressures. Basically,
 
 -12-
 
 8/20/96
 
 see evidence wage behavior first half
 year supports view operating level resource
 utilization incompatible maintenance steady rate
 inflation economy. tight conditions,
 particularly looking capacity utilization side picture
 well labor market side, would anticipate, absent
 external shocks, rapid pickup inflation. would
 expect gradual updrift.
 MR. PARRY. change forecast last couple

 MR. PRELL. I've observed well know, data

 that, look aggregate level happening

 Greenbook analysis assumes hourly workers earning $6 hour

 generally, price front reports still

 MR. MEYER. Thank you. clearly still struggling
 two questions occupied us last meeting. First,
 economy slowing likely slow quickly enough trend
 least stabilize unemployment rate current level? Secondly,
 current level unemployment rate definitively NAIRU
 ensures trend toward higher inflation? Greenbook
 gives us optimistic answer first question pessimistic
 answer second. data available since last meeting gave
 little confidence answer first question
 still left uncertainty second.
 lot mention around table already
 risks higher inflation result uncertainty.
 hope won't ignore fact slowdown potential
 allow economy sustain trend growth current level
 unemployment modest, stable inflation least period.
 persistence slowdown hardly assured, data
 become available since last meeting provide evidence
 slowing could anticipate then. certainly reinforces
 confidence slowdown projected staff, also
 consistent consensus private sector forecasters. So,
 think provisional "yes" order slowdown scenario.
 course, talking really knife edge--slowing
 trend. obviously going revisit

 real key second question; heart
 problem. staff forecast answer second question
 follows:
 unemployment rate already NAIRU remain
 projected slowdown, resulting gradual, persistent
 deterioration inflation. minimum wage increase
 ingredient staff forecast higher inflation,
 spice substance. fundamental source conviction
 current unemployment rate incompatible stable
 inflation. problem face acting forecast
 pattern rising inflation projects going forward

 interpretation. staff views benign inflation environment
 recent quarters temporary aberration relative longerstanding regularities. Technically, excellent inflation

 question whether current unemployment rate
 NAIRU taken account estimate NAIRU based

 last couple years. Indeed, estimation techniques weigh
 recent data heavily suggest NAIRU declined
 recently may close 5-1/2 percent today.
 inflation picture even impressive many
 acknowledge. broad measures inflation declined

 many cases even hint ongoing disinflation. Consider particularly
 recent patterns chain measures GDP price index,
 gross domestic purchases price index, PCE price index.

 preceding year. least available core measures,
 inflation measures near recent low second
 quarter. CPI contrast closer 3 percent 2 percent,
 less evidence ongoing deceleration. even
 CPI, overall core inflation rates lower four
 quarters ended second quarter previous year.
 ECI data challenge us, seeing signs higher
 wages. think ought take account that, given slowdown
 rise benefit costs, increase wage pressures
 passing forward benefits firms received
 lower benefit costs. So, want focus total compensation,
 wages. edging compensation;

 First, entrepreneur careful, apparent 6.9

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Yellen.
 
 GOVERNOR YELLEN. naively hoped long
 intermeeting interval many key data releases fog
 uncertainty hovering forecast might lift time
 meeting. Unfortunately, many noted, body incoming
 data provided modest illumination respect two
 fundamental issues cloud outlook. are, many
 indicated, whether aggregate demand poised slow toward
 trend whether core inflation process accelerating.
 answers questions really identical
 Governor Meyer.
 first issue, agree many

 demand-side indicators along Beigebook

 extent timing moderation demand remain highly uncertain
 significant risks remain. would enumerate two. inventorysales ratios relatively low levels, surge inventory investment
 attendant multiplier-accelerator feedbacks seems
 definite upside risk. Another risk stock market. Present
 market valuations appear based earnings expectations
 highly optimistic. Market participants could easily disappointed,
 particularly productivity performance disappointing wage
 pressures intensify, thereby setting stage significant
 correction.
 respect inflation outlook, opinion little
 changed last time. Labor markets clearly remain tight,
 unemployment decisively broken recent range. And,
 
 -34-
 
 8/20/96
 
 Governor Meyer emphasized, broad measures price inflation
 still declining. one smoothes noise, seems
 trend toward rapid pace wage salary growth
 quite firmly established. time, growth benefit costs
 remains well contained, least thus far, also found Vice
 Chairman's comments prospects hopeful sign.
 bottom line mild acceleration pace
 nominal compensation growth, course matters unit
 labor costs. spite uptick, though, nominal compensation
 growth still remains well pace historical econometric
 relations would predicting, uptick may thus simply reflect
 rebound toward normal level. So, assuming productivity
 growth recovers somewhat toward past trend roughly 1 percent-and agree significant assumption--or profit margins
 erode somewhat, think present pace compensation growth
 consistent stable inflation rates broad measures
 product prices.
 Now, suppose someone, someone I, firmly
 adheres view economy currently operating NAIRU

 view? would agree Governor Meyer; think answer
 no. hand, historical evidence strongly suggests
 NAIRU higher 5.4 percent, would dangerous
 foolish discount possibility modest uptick
 compensation seeing beginning process
 that, left unchecked, lead gradually accelerating
 inflation. think minimum wage increase compound risks.
 reviewed transcript last meeting, found

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Rivlin, top that.
 
 MS. RIVLIN. Let put slightly positive cast
 facts. seems little hard
 ourselves. Actually, fairly pleased
 way economy performing, general understanding
 expressed last meeting. may definitive data intermeeting period, least
 surprises. Everything come pretty consistent
 thought. July, knew economy clearly
 growing potential, labor markets tight,
 beginning indication wage acceleration
 offset behavior benefit costs, little
 evidence accelerating price inflation. little
 queasy forecast slowdown could see
 slowdown anywhere available data. happening yet,
 two big questions. One was, would slowdown fact

 occur begin evident? fundamental question was,
 could continue run labor markets tight without incurring
 accelerating inflation? put technically, NAIRU
 it? indeed lower thought?
 inflation risk clearly there. seems August
 statistics come track thought
 would. evidence slowdown also seems supported
 anecdotal regional information heard around table.
 Labor markets still tight, little evidence
 wage pressures evidence yet price pressures. minimum
 wage new law today President signs it,
 really new information. knew minimum wage
 last time, indeed since spring. built
 actual Fed forecast, certainly minds
 talking knew minimum wage
 legislation going happen. So, seem
 structured problem right. see economy probably
 growing think potential. still know
 whether sustain currently low level unemployment
 long without escalating wage pressures.
 struck fact President McDonough
 one mentioned big bill signed
 President week, namely, welfare reform. legislation
 threatens put good deal pressure state governments,
 New York, also puts strong relief
 problem tight labor markets be. going
 successful integrating welfare population
 labor force, important keep labor markets pretty tight.
 So, erring side precipitating recession, without
 taking serious risk inflation, still seems particularly
 important reason, right next
 several years. reading still big question,
 given expansion slowing, whether labor markets
 tight. wage information inconclusive, see reason
 losing nerve see things coming track
