 Thank you.
 
 Questions Peter?
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Concerning French budget, appears

 MR. FISHER. put market's reaction nutshell,
 think market focusing question whether

 MR. FISHER.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. real question outlook
 EMU. one thinks EMU going fail, one would expect
 deutsche mark rally sharply. one expects EMU hold
 together, whatever reason--all countries may running 5
 percent deficits may still decide come together--that
 means deutsche mark going put structure
 inhibit strength, EMU do.
 So,
 really involved practical judgment prospects
 EMU, whether good bad, don't think market going

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes, raises questions. However,

 Therefore, inflation continue rate; simply

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Meyer.
 
 9/24/96

 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. data
 become available since August meeting provided quite
 interesting set crosscurrents. one hand, data indicate
 growth slowed much sharply third quarter
 previously expected, moving pace close trend. Moreover,
 apparent mix final sales inventory investment suggests
 diminished prospect above-trend growth period immediately
 ahead. hand, August employment reports suggest
 labor markets become even tighter, raising danger still
 faster acceleration wages therefore increasing risk
 higher price inflation going forward even growth slowed
 trend. Thus, case tightening slow growth trend
 diminished judgment, case tightening counter
 inflationary utilization rates may increased. Well, never
 gets easy. time, August CPI PPI reports challenge
 us evidence core inflation continues edge lower
 despite utilization rates historically would already
 associated rising inflation. Let elaborate two
 issues, beginning prospects growth.
 comfortable broad outline path
 real GDP Greenbook forecast, would bit
 aggressive lowering forecast third-quarter growth.
 three significant reports since last meeting suggest
 slower growth: August retail sales report, July construction
 put-in-place report, July foreign trade report. Cathy,
 mentioned earlier concerned consumer spending might
 even stronger Greenbook forecast. concern would
 quite different. suspect consumer spending growing least
 1/2 percentage point slowly current quarter
 Greenbook projecting. So, think central tendency right

 reconciled strong third-quarter inventory growth consistent
 rapid inventory buildup reported July. However,
 rebound inventory investment leaves third-quarter growth closer

 slower fourth-quarter growth becomes still persuasive.
 think important implication developments
 third quarter may unexpectedly sharp slowing

 Fundamentals suggest serious likelihood

 Indeed, continue expect that, unchanged

 policy, growth near trend slightly coming
 quarters. Nevertheless, sharpness weakening final sales
 third quarter adds cautionary note forecast
 provides rationale waiting data confirm expected
 stabilization final demand.
 Second, utilization rates: decline unemployment
 rate 5.1 percent August another significant piece data.
 suggested labor market may tightened August
 5-1/2 percent area last couple years, 5 5-1/4
 range period immediately ahead. good reasons
 believe decline unemployment rate August

 also reason believe above-trend growth first

 provisionally NAIRU low 5-1/2 percent. buy
 NAIRU low 5 percent. result August employment
 report, uncertainty degree labor market

 forward also somewhat greater earlier.
 Third, word inflation performance: 12-month
 inflation rate, measured core CPI, declined 2.6 percent
 August, tenth lower previous four months,
 declined nearly half percentage point since end 1995.
 12-month core PPI inflation rate 1.4 percent August, close
 half pace end last year. inflation

 monetary policy forward-looking, disparity

 previous forecast plainly suggested need slowdown.
 However, concern rooted belief rate

 Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, prepared support

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. want pursue issue Ed

 MR. MELZER.
 
 Okay.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Meyer.
 
 MR. MEYER. Peter, let ask question help
 education. took two things memo. One, want
 switch average duration limit way measuring overall
 liquidity portfolio. second issue interesting
 seemed real question, i.e., whether case
 increasing average duration. note reserves invested
 without price exposure liquidity primary objective.
 would seem suggest low average duration. So, need
 understand buy increasing duration. Let bring
 story 10-month versus 18-month average
 duration; good example. started saying would
 like 10-month average duration target, want
 18 months limit case necessity
 significant intervention. brings head point
 implied discussion that, course, going
 sell short end. actually say that,
 implication would sell short end
 portfolio. So, holding long-term securities?
 MR. FISHER. tried make clear several points
 memo. First, urge Committee adopt 18-month
 duration limit solely liquidity measurement purposes. think
 replacement current 12-month maturity ceiling
 intended limit price risk force certain amount
 liquidity portfolio. perverse effects.
 major owner illiquid government bonds short
 end German yield curve. continue try get
 Bundesbank's balance sheet without increase duration,
 going buying illiquidity short-dated cats
 dogs German yield curve, contrary objective
 wanting liquid. So, buying less less liquid
 paper. less liquid buying securities "on run"
 recent auctions permitting decay subportfolio spread evenly along yield curve. bit
 background think changes complexion
 pointing at.
 also feel necessity get
 Bundesbank's balance sheet. decade ago entirely
 dependent balance sheet. 1/4 1/2 reserves
 German banking system owned us Bundesbank's
 balance sheet. much smaller proportion part
 moved balance sheet part
 Berlin Wall came reserves expanded German banking
 system. major shift. think ought recognize
 Bundesbank different position are. Let
 turn around. couple months ago, Committee
 discussed question facilities foreign central banks

 reluctance, skepticism, concern. going come back
 try address issues modified proposal. currently
 maintain tens billions dollars deutsche marks
 Bundesbank's balance sheet zero liquidity cost. liquidate

 Now, put context, need get balance

 rather good natured tardiness response
 request. take need given, look
 place invest. think reasonable first step diversify
 balance sheet invest "on run" German government
 securities purchase auction, build small subportfolio. So, it's different mix factors think were-MR. MEYER. thought compelling story German

 MR. FISHER.
 
 similar.
 
 MR. MEYER. difference way buy differs
 way sell, really question.
 situation domestically liquidations occur short
 end buying occurs wide maturity range. want
 understand achieve buying wider maturity span
 intend sell.
 MR. FISHER. I'm sorry; meant answer question
 well. mean say automatically liquidate
 short end need liquidate large amounts.
 Indeed, many central banks--the European central banks--discovered

 slowly gradually time. may another source

 either/or flavor them. may liquidate significantly short
 end may repo long end rebalance portfolio
 gradually. much intention enhanced

 So, point well taken.
 MR. TRUMAN. one factual point might

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's first Deputy Secretary

 MR. BERNARD. would amend Paragraph 5

 questions ask Peter move specific views
 members? Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. think issues come
 started get respect investment foreign
 currency reserves. seems talking
 terms portfolio compromise two ideas call
 buy-side neutrality sell-side liquidity. struggling learn
 deal that. Buy-side neutrality says mirror
 everything impact particular markets.
 sell-side liquidity says sell, sell short-term
 securities. obviously deal it. seems
 current practice attempt deal
 compromise segregating bills portion sell
 rest mirroring. question whether could

 seems similar story tell regulation

 question seems whether procedure

 MR. FISHER. Yes, think is. Let make one comment
 might help members comment it: wish
 made point clear memo. addition two different
 kinds neutrality pointing to, two different
 kinds sell-side neutrality. One short-run, sell-side
 neutrality relates impact market today.

 public portfolio affected selling.
 hypothetical cases Meulendyke memo points to,
 liquidate $50 $100 billion short end,
 would rather profound impact public portfolio
 thus would sell-side neutral market neutral long-run
 sense. So, another balancing going there. think much
 history portfolio reflected tension
 two different kinds neutrality. Obviously, market
 situations would want sell across yield curve,
 might would. Clearly, generally
 convenient liquidate principally short end.
 caveat, agree entirely formulation problem.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? Peter needs
 members reaction memorandum
 move forward.
 MR. BOEHNE. think case moving toward somewhat
 liquid portfolio makes lot sense. don't know whether
 ought 60 percent bills, 2/3 bills, rest coupons,
 think Peter rather persuasively laid case need
 move direction. Perhaps way would move to,
 say, 60/40 split see like that. feel need
 move get there, could move further.
 long think would take move 60/40 split
 portfolio?
 MR. FISHER. Sandy Krieger thinks long
 transition might take us, would note move direction
 probably would need Treasury treat us explicitly
 "add-on" bill auctions. because,
 deficits come down, contracting bill offers
 along foreign central banks become rather large
 share competitive auctions. think issue solvable
 Treasury would amenable, want do,
 working us that. agreement would
 add-on--I trying think top head quickly
 portfolio behaves--I would guess might take five years
 move holdings bills smooth way 50 percent 60
 percent portfolio.
 MR. BOEHNE. think ought move direction
 take another look it. might wait five years might
 look toward getting progress report two three years
 judge 60 percent makes sense. don't think
 absolutely right number, think know direction
 ought moving, ought get started.

 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. may naive question, liquidity
 absolutely determined percentage bills System
 portfolio? priori, bills, liquidity?
 securities commonly used repo transactions every bit

 MR. FISHER. certainly good deal depth
 long end yield curve, given history current

 anyone's mind bill sector much liquid. Now, think

 Treasury this. long period time relative liquidity

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 less liquid, yes.
 
 MR. FISHER. immutable fact, fact

 Treasury extending overall maturity structure.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Treasury shortened debt structure.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Liquidity repos, ease

 one arrange them, decreases crisis atmosphere.
 precisely may really need liquid portfolio.
 never question about, say, 12-day bills, whereas finding counterparties may difficult want repos crisis.
 Everyone running cover.

 9/24/96
 
 MR. KOHN. point liquidity bills,
 President Minehan, could absorb reserves readily
 simply allowing run maturity.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. KOHN. one reason Committee decided
 mid-1980s shift portfolio toward bills
 meant outright sales market would required
 accomplish large amount reserve absorption.
 MR. FISHER. would note also using
 traders' definition liquidity, ability execute
 transactions volume without moving price. Clearly, long end
 less liquid sense. maturity curve go
 selling, bigger price effect have.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right. would think went
 bills strategy, would complications associated
 large share auction perhaps large share
 given issue. might problem well. So, think
 gradual move liquid position without going way
 probably one preferred. asked question
 income. think income objective either,
 nobody else seems to.
 MR. KOHN. think past Committee talked
 conducting least transactions coupon end market
 market time time, possibility
 buying coupons certain unusual circumstances probably
 ruled out. something Desk done past.
 four five years ago, Committee concerned portfolio
 getting liquid, Desk instructed stop moving
 direction.
