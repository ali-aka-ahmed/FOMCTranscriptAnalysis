 July 2, 1996--Afternoon Session
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would like welcome Governors Rivlin
 Meyer first exposure Committee. also would
 like welcome Helen Holcomb, First Vice President
 Dallas Bank, first meeting. hesitate welcome,
 choice approve minutes, friend there. Would
 someone like move minutes?
 SEVERAL.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Peter,
 [Laughter] on.
 referring moment ago.
 MR. FISHER. referring package charts
 distributed. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. interesting charts.
 little puzzled implicit theoretical construction
 charts showing relationship implied volatilities
 currency options exchange rates. would problem
 endeavoring evaluate market price stocks, bonds,
 tomatoes, whatever net long position.
 exchange rates nature, course, appears
 theoretical basis arguing low volatility harbinger
 weak dollar--or whatever saying!--is sharply rising
 volatility saying harbinger weaker dollar?
 MR. FISHER. change dollar. tried careful.
 look two charts, tend suggest random walk
 relationship increased volatility direction
 dollar go, last years direction
 toward weaker dollar.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 say nothing
 
 [Laughter] little puzzled sense
 statement!
 whatever theoretical construction dollar,
 exactly opposite deutsche mark. curious
 explain fact getting type
 relationship one currency reverse other.
 looking really random events theoretical conception
 impose data explain don't get
 opposite effects dollar versus mark.
 MR. FISHER. Well, going able answer
 theoretical level long sweep history. data show
 last couple years market bias
 favor mark; volatility pops, dollar
 weakens. point ought random walk
 way exchange rate goes volatility goes up, think
 probably case long sweep history. phenomena
 looking concerned theoretical
 principled articulation relationship options spot
 prices, relate observed heard talking
 dealers, namely, people writing large number
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 options right now. So, offering statistical data points
 chart reflect hear market
 options written.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Theoretically, exchange transactions
 technical factors neutral. extent
 neutral, net long positions particular
 security, claim, something nature. really puzzled
 construct something like this. don't deny
 relationship, outside realm random walk.
 Clearly, get noise series, curious whether
 come upon something little curiosity

 market itself.
 MR. FISHER. think degree curiosity and,
 given history last years, point concern
 level options written.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think that.
 interesting set relationships, sure make
 it. said, curious. Governor Lindsey.
 MR. LINDSEY. share concern. little worried
 may seeing. thought little
 differently. would seem autumn going
 interesting period, particularly among European currencies.
 motivating banks write options, bet continuing low volatility
 exchange market when, reading papers, told
 volatility going increasing? seems
 lot risk usual.
 MR. FISHER. incentive evident
 can't make money normal channels.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 can't make money old-fashioned way!
 
 MR. FISHER. subject rather disciplined
 approach income targets set terms level
 income supposed achieve month month. saying
 pretty sight.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 So, back incentive-structure
 
 problem?
 MR. FISHER.
 part it.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 think short run, yes, big
 first time.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Peter, question domestic
 operations. see something like 50 percent fed funds rate,
 catches attention. comments made reference
 inefficiencies anomalies distribution reserves yesterday
 today initially led banks think market

 improve somewhat either quality information

 MR. FISHER. Let try take second leg first.
 skewing demand reserves toward end
 maintenance period normal pattern one seen
 become pronounced past year. initial reaction
 try force banks smooth demand reserves, force
 come smoother way course period.
 That, though, negative feedback consequence making
 funds rate soft early period. can't fight it.
 want reserves want pushing hard
 counter work. So, current environment
 found fruitful course try insist take reserves
 want give them.
 regard information available market,
 think may steps could take. somewhat
 uncomfortable continued use customer RP,
 bit historical artifact. used reflect pass-through
 repo pool repo pool $2 $3 billion
 similarly small amount. repo pool $10 billion more,
 really pass market sense.
 customer RP also used predecessors non-signaling
 device, likewise longer necessary,
 tradition amount done publicly attached it.
 One thought have, intend propose come back
 outline steps go conduct
 operations earlier day, would ask guidance

 would System Account RPs. Currently customer
 RP, announce might do, say, total $1.5 billion;
 however, tell market RPs System

 think big step right direction would limit
 operations System repos finish review
 propositions received given operation could
 announce market much done--whether $4.5 billion
 whatever amount. Interestingly, would helped us
 much yesterday anomalous day.
 reserves thought, would led market astray
 thinking fewer reserves. So, would

 anticipated. money became available toward end
 day, federal funds rate fell sharply late day. So,
 provision little information yesterday might misled
 market. general think practice would useful
 intend come back Committee--perhaps August
 September meeting--with little detail might provide
 information public.
 MR. JORDAN. come back address
 fundamental issue current reserve settlement structure,

 MR. KOHN. folks looking

 uncertainties. staff Board New York
 Bank looking could simplify things.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. would like state hypothesis
 ask Peter would evaluate it, since closer
 foreign exchange market days am. seems one
 reasons people writing lot options--because
 profitability available--is driven developments
 foreign exchange market. major players
 investment people systems heavy fixed
 costs. example, part remuneration deemed
 variable past, namely bonuses, becoming
 sticky. major foreign banks, mainly New York
 market, hiring reasonably pedestrian dealers kinds
 market instruments especially foreign exchange giving
 fixed-period contracts assured bonuses. So, bonus becomes
 fixed cost two three years. kind
 situation, unless willing absorb operating losses,
 scramble look whatever profit opportunities seem
 available. means would tendency develop
 large positions, whether derivatives cash market.
 unexpected move market, likelihood people
 scrambling cover positions lead greater volatility.
 make sense you, Peter?
 MR. FISHER. Yes, think does, particularly
 foreign exchange market. early mid-'90s period
 firms building capacity. great successes income
 terms '92, '93 '94 many dealing rooms led build
 capacity fixed costs described,
 think feeling pain and, perhaps regrettably,
 driving expansion position-taking.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would implied volatilities
 historical volatilities move respect magnitude
 exchange rate movements?
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 MR. FISHER. exchange rate movements follow changes
 historical volatility lag.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. FISHER.
 
 order magnitude?
 
 sorry can't calculate top
 
 head.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One issues raises that,
 structural problem supply demand options,
 would tend reflect inefficient options market
 turn would tend reflect pattern differs actual
 volatility exchange market. One way testing hypothesis
 look option volatilities relate actual
 historical volatility, would give us least sense
 structural change system.
 MR. FISHER. Well, let try you. hope
 helpful. talked one person firm market
 great deal respect, referred current level
 options high low. Implied volatility high
 still considerably recent historical
 experience.
 low taste didn't think
 going get compensated risks would taking
 current levels.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 learning something!
 
 don't know learning,
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think hypothesis checks out,
 go back work that.
 MR. FISHER.
 
 Yes, go back work that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Peter, wanted ask source
 options data use calculations charts.
 MR. KOS.
 
 couple investment firms gave us data.
 
 MR. FISHER. back data provided couple
 investment banks. collecting recent data routinely
 screens ourselves.
 MR. KOS. fresh 1-month 12-month implied
 volatilities OTC options collected every day; data
 obtained exchanges.
 MS. PHILLIPS. So, basically over-the-counter.
 think comparable going back far do?
 MR. FISHER.
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 

 
 best data able get.
 Well, okay.

 MESSRS. PRELL TRUMAN. [Statements--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Going back analysis world oil

 MR. TRUMAN. changes production barrels per

 that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. gather Norwegian expansion
 accelerating recently. going peter out?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Well, probably know better I, every
 
 time looked North Sea production last 10 years,
 going diminish 2 years. people look this,
 
 include experts International Energy Agency, expect
 Norwegian production level peak level 1997

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. table implies reach

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, one issue question

 Yes.

 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, compare current forecast
 May forecast, appears virtually change economywide measures. guess exception CPI 1996. Yet,
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 read Greenbook, impression came
 presentation today, seem shifted assessment
 risks significantly side. rationale
 shifting risks without impact expected values
 forecast? fact, think asked question risks
 many times past, recall gotten one answer,
 namely, risks symmetric.
 MR. PRELL. think occasions
 indicated risks outlook asymmetric. would
 characterize forecasts years effort present
 meaningful, modal forecast likely outcome. felt
 skewness probability distribution, tried
 identify it. instance, looked recent data,
 felt greater thickness area probability
 distribution little modal forecast, particularly
 near term, side forecast.
 conscious fact made biggest
 mistakes past losing sight trends responding
 run recent data, part reason tried
 focus attention GDP pattern moving-average basis.
 getting erratic movements GDP data past
 year two, may well seeing another episode kind.
 don't feel uncomfortable saying think highest

 see alternative scenario somewhat faster growth
 near term projected.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Ted, Chart 10, given us nifty
 tool analysis.
 question one assumptions.
 policy assumption chart U.S. foreign monetary
 authorities target nominal GDP. knowledge nominal GDP
 developments developing countries, including much East Asia
 Latin America, big effect decisions. Would
 need relax assumption regard developing
 countries?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, uncovered sleight hand.
 Actually, formal assumption make developing
 countries model simulations interest rates follow
 interest rates.
 So, damp nominal GDP lean
 
 surge nominal GDP raising interest rates, rates go up,
 too. Actually, ran simulation, proved
 insufficient, perhaps obvious reasons. therefore went
 constrained GDP growth path countries. took
 shock, want put way, growth
 developing countries continue higher path.
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 added constraint certainly isn't --
 
 MR. TRUMAN. got result without specifying policy
 mechanism nominal GDP held countries,
 terms trying control impetus U.S. economy,
 achieved modest result. fact, another way,
 came huge expansion developing countries
 rise U.S. interest rates insufficient set timely
 multiplier-accelerator process reverse. therefore went
 essentially damped things got something close
 growth path developing countries
 developed countries real level economic activity rises
 first two years, essentially levels off,
 subsequently comes bit interest rate effects take hold.
 essentially income path cases U.S.
 economy.
 MR. LINDSEY. wouldn't exchange rate peg work
 model? would somewhat relaxed assumption one
 made, less relaxed unconstrained model.
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, model runs interest rates
 exchange rates developing countries stay pretty much
 line dollar. one reasons, fact,
 different exchange rate two scenarios. first
 case interest rates go industrial countries
 United States go pulls
 currencies. second case, don't effect, that's
 dollar goes way relation
 currencies industrial countries, share sense
 income growth factors.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. would like refer Chart 14
 relating labor markets. labor productivity, obviously
 key consideration forecast, think recent
 economic data productivity trailing even trend
 line would indicate. Indeed, productivity improvement
 1997 1 percent forecast.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Roughly.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. something
 concerned terms possibility might
 high side something that, within confidence factors
 estimating productivity, feeling rather confident about?
 MR. PRELL. would say one things
 feel least discomfort about. forecasting fairly steady,
 moderate growth productivity. don't start major
 disequilibria see terms employers hired well
 beyond production levels. trend increase productivity seems
 entirely reasonable circumstances. think question
 whether trend extended

 obviously discussed many times around table whether
 recent higher levels investment changes technology
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 might bring acceleration productivity growth.
 seen yet; recent figures don't indicate it. So,
 staying pretty much fairly straightforward extrapolation
 recent trends.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Mr. Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN.
 Mike, want ask question get
 response standpoint forecast, also want get
 Peter Fisher's response standpoint market would
 react. made reference slight declines longer-term interest
 rates; used 10-year rate chart. think
 forecast next six months, ask going happen
 real GDP decelerates indicated growth rate around 4
 percent second quarter rates forecast 2.3 1.9
 percent third fourth quarters; monthly average
 CPI increase .2 percent remaining seven months
 year; housing starts drop 1.46 - 1.47 million area; motor
 vehicle sales production drop rate 15 million units
 something that; job growth slows increases
 100,000 month final three months year. wonder
 reaction going bond market, pattern
 economic statistics seen unfolding. consistent
 slight decline bond yields?
 MR. PRELL. quite reasonable question,
 certainly would see implausible bond market
 rallying beyond assumption period time. view,
 thing would tend limit rally terms
 far yields might go permanently don't
 particularly steep yield curve point. one hypothesized
 months road economy perceived
 stable, sustainable, moderate growth course inflation perhaps
 creeping up, would expect--with assumed 5-1/4 percent
 federal funds rate--to see bond yield go lot lower
 anticipate. Basically, long bond moving range
 somewhere around 6-3/4 percent. would surprising
 run softer data would induce bond rally would bring
 yield noticeably level. far yield long
 bond would expected go ongoing basis, think,
 question. Clearly, market talking
 6 percent bond yields terms variability
 seeing market--the overshooting--that level well within
 reach run appealing data.
 MR. FISHER.
 
 can't improve that; agree Mike.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Mike, recently auto industry consultant
 drop Bank. couple things say I, least,
 found interesting want get reaction it. First,
 quite sanguine outlook light motor vehicle sales
 extending number years; basically, saw continuing
 run 15 million units annual rate. largely

 also talked perceives great deal excess
 productive capacity worldwide. Even allowing sales growth
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 Latin America parts Asia, view lot

 would implications labor negotiations coming
 along later year.
 MR. PRELL. don't know much useful excess capacity
 left United States. suspect tote numbers
 looks lot, look current production
 problems, see that, categories cars trucks
 people want buy, manufacturers would like build
 currently can. isn't simply matter assembly capacity.
 many cases capacity limits production key

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. quick couple questions, Mike.

 MR. PRELL. Well, yield colleague, much
 expert this, is, sense, discontinuity here.

 "Trend" tells us slope growth

 -14-
 
 MR. MEYER. mentioned discounting recent
 increases average hourly earnings and, take it, employment
 cost index measure wage gains. Why?
 MR. PRELL. average hourly earnings, charts
 look dramatic take latest observation think
 terms 12-month change. recognize
 odd reading year earlier drop get next
 reading, would surprised see 12-month change move
 3.4 percent latest month back toward 3 percent.
 would still lows saw couple years ago

 looking composition, looking happened terms sales

 likely going see considerable slackening

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mike, get confirmation
 chain-weighted average hourly earnings calculation? come in?
 MR. PRELL. told would trying get that,
 heard anything.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think ought point
 BLS calculate chain-weighted average hourly earnings index
 endeavors take inter-industry effects approximately 300
 400 industries. Unless calculation done inappropriately,
 shows actual diminution instead acceleration last
 12 months year-over-year basis. implies
 been, calculations correct, significant shift
 composition toward higher-paid production worker industries--not
 occupations industries--and raises interesting issues
 trend raw average hourly earnings data shows
 year-over-year question May data. assume
 get test Friday whether hypothesis
 correct.
 MR. PRELL. anticipating might yield
 considerable narrowing gap recent levels
 two measures. guess would characterize chain-weighted
 measure moved pretty much sideways channel
 last year opposed upward sloping channel. still think
 regular average hourly earnings series compensation per hour
 data productivity costs, don't fixed weights,
 also yield useful information going within

 is, markup might applied kind compensation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Doesn't depend relationship
 individual wages individual productivity? reason
 fixed relationship individual wage
 productivity level, change wages associated
 comparable shift productivity, unit labor costs
 invariant shift. So, really stipulate
 
 -15-
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 relationship marginal productivity wages different
 groups don't know evidence that.
 MR. PRELL. Again, explored great depth
 concern might that, cyclical experience, one sees
 changing weight measures tending accelerate, perhaps
 early signal broader pressures labor market. So,
 think it's worth looking measures, certainly
 chain-weighted measure suggest may complexity
 picture, worth investigation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. second-quarter ECI certainly
 interesting piece information. looks though
 calculated unambiguously appropriate manner.
 MR. PRELL. Well, lot definitional problems,
 suspect firms fill form
 confronted real challenge sorting instructions.
 MR. MEYER. question role stock

 role slowdown scenario two ways. One, correct

 MR. PRELL.
 [Laughter]
 
 One reach conclusion.
 
 One has!
 
 MR. MEYER. know, done thing,
 sympathize that. leaning little wealth

 MR. PRELL.

 MR. MEYER. Secondly, top mild stock

 MR. PRELL.
 
 That's right.

 Governor Yellen.
 
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. try brief
 because, like President Broaddus, would like take little extra
 time next go-around concerning price objectives monetary
 policy.
 key questions today identical last
 meeting. aggregate demand really moderate second half
 year, see uptick core inflation due
 increasing wage pressures already tight labor markets
 feedback higher food prices wage demands? respect
 slowdown aggregate demand, confess ignorance concern.
 agree Greenbook aggregate demand probably slow
 toward trend, reasons familiar,
 probably usual long variable lags. Higher
 interest rates somewhat stronger dollar eventually take
 toll housing, associated consumer durables, net exports.
 influence growth inherently transitory factors like
 rebuilding auto inventories soon wane, data already

 predictions accelerator. admit scanty
 evidence housing markets poised cool. Computer investment
 may turn stronger Greenbook anticipates. also agree
 Greenbook leaner inventories, surge inventory
 investment possible poses upside risks. final demand growth
 proves significantly stronger anticipated, inventory
 investment could increase, touching new round
 inventory cycle. risks seem weighted toward side.
 respect inflation, though, number
 emphasized, news favorable. Core inflation CPI

 succeed putting firm ceiling inflation,
 could subsequently move separate difficult issues
 revolving around go reducing inflation -what timing approaches use. Janet
 done excellent job outlining issues
 tradeoffs.
 
 stage, two approaches suggested --
 
 opportunistic approach conventional deliberate approach.
 uncomfortable opportunistic approach,
 offer three reasons why. First, keeping mind
 ultimate goal temporary price stability permanent price
 stability, opportunistic strategy seems premised idea
 recessions permanently rather temporarily
 disinflationary. trouble understanding that. make
 lot sense unless recession byproduct deliberate
 efforts Federal Reserve reduce trend inflation. short,
 sure autonomous recession opportunities
 there, use awkward phrase, counted
 reduce inflation permanently absence deliberate effort
 part.
 Second, think one persuasive arguments
 following opportunistic policy would might deflect
 criticism could expected receive follow
 deliberate approach perceived public perhaps keeping
 policy tight keeping economy slack way reducing
 inflation rate. kind strategy going work,
 
 -49-
 
 7/2-3/96
 
 would seem imply recessions would ease policy
 aggressively would trying reduce inflation
 rate permanently. first glance, might look approach
 would less visible, less open criticism, less lightning
 rod, thus one would likely succeed. think
 risk eventually public would catch on,
 would open criticism easing policy
 aggressively enough recession. Think phrases might
 come -- "we kicking economy down"
 forth. got kind feedback, could undermine
 effectiveness strategy time.
 So, really clear
 would gaining approach.
 Third finally, always thought word
 opportunistic mildly pejorative connotation. looked
 Webster's defined follows:
 "The act, policy,
 practice taking advantage opportunities circumstances,
 especially little regard principles consequences."
 [Laughter]
 So, decide adopt strategy, would hope
 least would find another name it. Better yet, think
 would better follow deliberate, conventional policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Principled opportunism.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.

 close call whether tighten going forward early
 August, comfortable recommendation
 change policy meeting asymmetric policy directive.
 four good reasons change policy
 time. First, accept staff forecast take
 opportunistic approach future disinflation, think
 strong grounds tightening today. staff forecast suggests
 that, current monetary policy settings, sustain

 Second, think quite importantly, perspective

 simulations provide plausible picture acceleration
 inflation unemployment rate slightly NAIRU,

 core inflation measures justify tightening.

 important role nation's financial center

 fundamental question underlies several discussions swaps

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. think history swap arrangements

 Somewhat answer Governor Rivlin's concerns, would seem

 However, Tom Hoenig said well; know timing

 consequence, strikes existence may tend time

 MS. YELLEN. Mr. Chairman, agree swap arrangements
 large legacy times past may become something
 anachronism. even arrangements become largely
 symbolic, seem important symbol
 commitment international cooperation. agree particularly
 Governor Rivlin President Boehne. think would
 dangerous simply dismantle arrangements way creates
 international tension. really see arrangements
 dangerous. understand principle President Broaddus
 enunciated could dangerous ability conduct
 independent monetary policy, think fear overblown.
 agree President Boehne could even helpful
 occasion future.
 would support suggestion made, Mr. Chairman,
 might wise look opportunity Basle elsewhere
 discuss future arrangements quietly central
 bank partners see reactions would be. would
 want see needless tension created here. also agree
 conversations, would wise figure
 might want go future able react suggestions
 replace arrangements something else. respect
 system repo reverse repo-type arrangements, think
 possibility well worth exploring. would agree also
 President Broaddus's list questions would need
 addressed answered. see fundamental purpose?
 guard systemic risk? service allies?
 reserve management needs? transactions
 demand? privilege? right? limits?
 intend deal? criteria use decide
 countries? think Governor Kelley's question private
 markets impact might private institutions
 become increasingly large players area question
 explore along broad issue governance
 structure proceed. need work make
 decisions authorization required. think
 good opportunity staff go home work.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Moskow.
 
 MR. MOSKOW. seems obvious original purpose
 establishing swap arrangements longer relevant
 was. think necessarily means
 unilaterally dismantle swap lines. reciprocal
 arrangements. counterparts sense longer
 need swap lines, might appropriate begin
 discussions best proceed disassembling without
 unnecessary adverse reactions. Mr. Chairman, think suggestion
 informal discussions Vice Chairman would
 central bankers Basle elsewhere good
 initial step. process thinking through,
 certainly explore alternative arrangements see
 needed better reflect current state international
 exchange markets, role play, whether swaps
 needed all. many issues involved, agree
 Governor Yellen send staff back
 work this, including private market aspect Governor Kelley
 mentioned. think included broader study

 like that. think for,
