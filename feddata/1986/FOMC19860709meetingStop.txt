 sense, would assume would fiscal multiplier

 So, think lot uncertainty here.

 MR. RICE. Mike, think heard say tax reform

 MR. PRELL. Well, state governments particular. Around 30
 states, recall, tax form state's tax rates
 applied income concept taxable income,
 adjusted gross income, one's federal tax return.
 changes contemplated personal income taxes--with fewer
 deductions on--that number larger. Thus, unless
 states lower tax rates, experience increase

 already

 think time progresses look budgets

 retained.
 That's implicit forecast.
 It's minor element.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. gone back forth thinking

 wanted hear discussion today.
 general, think it's important narrow aggregate

 Now, whether work going come

 One thing

 somebody tore apart said: "Well, 6 11 percent looks like

 think, politically, many people trying jump

 increase that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. get clear mind,
 literally true 6 11 percent implies 8 percent on?
 MR. KOHN.

 MR. MELZER.

 terms resetting range juncture could really
 affect credibility aggregate road.

 words, reset target pretty much rededicate

 don't think

 say going meet target put

 So, would like

 Midwest conditions expansion continue
 certainly slower pace parts country.
 consumer side way pretty vigorous.
 Retail sales
 improving one chain talked [best] May
 years. Auto sales seem pretty high, equal last
 year's level.
 manufacturing sector, always, pretty
 mixed. parts well continue
 well; building products example that.

 people building products side operating pretty much
 top capacity. parts weak show
 particular sign improvement. somewhat recent development
 two large crane manufacturers Midwest effect gone
 business; decided get out.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 kind manufacturers?
 
 MR. KEEHN. Heavy crane manufacturers. Farm equipment
 railroad equipment operating 25 percent levels
 late 1970s.
 Every while, maybe myself, take
 look railroad numbers.
 May year, example,

 ordering 6,000 level.
 That's 1985,
 full year railway equipment anticipation

 two specific areas thought would comment
 on. One construction activity, District
 Chicago particularly, continues extraordinarily
 strong. residential side, housing starts District
 [first] five months year 24 percent compared
 five months year ago.
 Illinois 57 percent
 think that's largest increase state country.

 Chicago number even much larger 57 percent.
 So,
 significant housing boom going on.
 nonresidential sector, floor contracts continuing
 seem like increasing levels. five months year
 floor area contracts nonresidential [structures] 5
 percent; that's contrast national figures, indicate
 slump. Chicago office boom continues despite strong
 activity last two three years.
 Many
 buildings announced; one way another 14 million
 square feet committed already

 trends going certainly seem pretty unsustainable.
 inflation side, news continues pretty good.
 Pricing terribly tight. Everybody talk says raw
