 MR. CROSS.
 Well, Bergsten saying long,

 look strictly trade considerations
 competitive considerations, that's seems influencing
 thinking. course, side question

 That's side problem this.

 MR. CROSS.
 Well, no.

 Obviously, still

 MR. JOHNSON. Peter, what's normal spread

 MR. TRUMAN.
 It's partly recognition fact

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. hate raise disconcerting thoughts

 Secondly--and think beginning see this-deal it.
 heavy volume refinancing going on, going
 tougher get financing new homes. potentially could
 bit adverse effect new home sales. consider
 overall situation, think comments similar
 others: outlook continues positive second

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, think animal spirits

 respect conjecture oil prices, think
 waiting long time U.S. bond market begin reflect
 current rate inflation. Expectations don't change readily
 bond market; do, don't think change back
 readily either. think bond market could accommodate
 kind limited upward movement oil prices likely
 see. So, would agree general configuration

 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, don't whole lot add
 comments made [at dinner] yesterday evening, I'm trying
 keep perspective least.
 true things
 going particularly well way.

 press might overplaying little; I'm sure
 quite dire reflected press.

 overall economic growth, continuing, gains
 becoming less less widely spread. increase
 non-agricultural employment, extent rest

 course, picked 2-point jump
 unemployment numbers, tried explain couple weeks ago
 --rationalizing least probably wasn't great.
 reading hearing since two weeks ago--though I'm
 sure want see March number--is 2-point jump
 fact high side.
 also tremendous amount refinancing going on.
 I'm hearing delays anywhere 6 weeks 2 months one
 get refinancing done.
 also have, particularly couple
 metropolitan areas Houston even Dallas, lot
 homes still auctioned foreclosed on.

 lot concern thrift industry way.
 lot problems and, course, press report
 Home Loan Bank bringing 250 examiners around

 energy issue effects inflation,
 would agree Jim--if understood correctly--that major

 inclined want believe

 little reservation terms confidence
 it's really going work well would appear.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. certainly agree three
 basic positive factors helping economy but,
 Jerry Bob said, couple cut either way-particularly oil price decline. Maybe feel good, tend
 emphasize pluses rather minuses.
 actually seeing lower gasoline prices pumps, normally
 would viewed plus auto sales; yet auto market
 seeing constraints coming consumer debt burden.

 actually heard bankers last couple weeks--these groups
 pass town circuit visit people--say
 beginning pay attention delinquencies
 consumer credit area may even bit evidence
 going look credit standards. offset,
 least partial offset, lower gasoline prices.
 Also, certainly would expect lower long-term interest
 rates help plant equipment spending; yet time

 So, don't believe going see import competition necessarily

 Therefore, fairly optimistic, optimistic
