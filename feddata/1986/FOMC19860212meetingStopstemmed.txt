 come similar number caught attent.
 mr. kichlin. right, think that's import featur.
 that's differ last four five year,
 know, current servic estim shown grow substanti

 gramm-rudman march 1 cut, jump spend assum
 spend rate slow. cbo assum
 congression action zero real growth, recent experi
 defens spend much faster administr [assumpt].
 net result 1991 mere $35 billion
 [differ] two defens alon,
 offset chang. interest rate differ; worth $20
 $25 billion. inflat rate substanti differ,
 
 2/11-12/86
 
 administr inflat drift 2 percent 1991
 henc index program grow much slower rate; current
 servic estim, that's worth someth order $25 billion
 1991.
 so, want mix match thing
 wai, instead 1991 number drift essenti
 $100 $110 billion without action probabl could
 anyth $50 $200 billion perfectli consist
 number. problem, think, great deal
 emphasi notion it's differ even without
