 MR. PRELL. Let check. Yes. $4-1/2 billion

 That's roughly range

 Basically, it's something goes overall output

 MR. PARRY. Well, show government spending

 MR. PRELL. Defense spending third quarter flat

 MS. SEGER. don't see negative tax reform impact,
 then, beyond first quarter?
 MR. PRELL. perceive increase
 cost capital.
 tax law changes, nothing else changing
 outlook, would tending depress capital spending.
 considerations--including fact that, perceive it, real

 long lag effects spending--are tending
 offset change. Furthermore, think output

 MS. SEGER. final question domestic auto sales:
 Apparently assume so-called "give-back"
 accomplished fourth quarter year sales
 sort flat unexciting quarter quarter 1987.
 MR. PRELL.
 I'm sure won't turn way.
 Short
 forecasting every twist turn marketing strategies,

 pace year. yes, [unintelligible] consistent
 payback largely end month things
 beginning turn bit--perhaps renewed incentives,
 necessary. don't point anticipate
 gigantic incentive programs put place near term.

 So, assuming GM really

 MR. PRELL. see trying keep things stable

 production schedules. [unintelligible] pick
 suggests maybe going move toward somewhat
 realistic approach production, might see something
 little smoother, fact, next year without pushing hard
 maintain seems unrealistic market share expectation.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. MELZER. Mike, trend personal consumption
 expenditures upward since fourth quarter last year.
 really showing dramatic shift fourth quarter,
 guess primarily autos.
 MR. PRELL(?).
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. MELZER. try factor effects
 tax legislation accelerated big ticket purchases extent

 MR. PRELL. Well, certainly attempted so.

 assessment may small effect. number

 So, putting things together,
 we're looking small effect consumer sector.
 MR. MELZER. related question: happened real

 MR. PRELL.
 MR. MELZER.

 MR. PRELL.
 Three things seem major factors there.
 One farm subsidy payments much smaller

 second factor consumer prices
