 important substantive question arose
 Mexicans this: Mr. Mancera, Governor Bank Mexico,
 told bridge going repaid IMF World
 Bank money time schedule anticipated money--and
 bridge going repaid pretty much November December-that's Mexico going need money
 bank loan concluded December. assuming
 target date bank loan--the target date sense
 actual disbursement first tranche bank loan--is
 December. is, justice, suspicious whether
 date met. says: date cannot met,
 do? December January official part, least,
 pretty much repaid. going losing money
 period balance payments deficit. doesn't look like [the
 plan] adequately designed meet needs.
 complaints too, including cost, got resolved last
 week. got resolved intervention, frankly,
 raises matter directed Committee. think
 point, bank loan delayed--which plan,
 think one assume might come December
 might delayed January even possibly early February.
 it's delayed longer that, think big failure
 hands. piece paper, might want glance at,
 shows precisely told wanted writing.
 [Turning staff:] don't give members Committee
 paper? would like back. it? Well, would
 like back read don't think
 something want public domain point.
 take minute read it. wanted meet seemed
 legitimate concerns happens bank loan doesn't come
 December. told personally would willing
 recommend Open Market Committee--as see
 hedged--that program track bank loan
 fact negotiated real problem bank loan
 going dispersed January, let's say, instead December,

 provided enough reassurance agreed whole
 thing.
