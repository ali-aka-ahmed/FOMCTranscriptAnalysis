 MS. SEGER. Could educate rather basic

 seems CRR introduced--almost three
 years ago whenever was--that one points made time
 would give Fed opportunity ability
 better control reserves money supply. yet hear

 problems forecasting estimating required reserves, etc.
 So,
 get message wrong almost three years ago something changed

 MR. KICHLINE. No, think little information
 that. Let's say open question little
 information assumption zero.
 MR. PRELL. wouldn't enter President Parry's
 question because, know, would affect GNP growth well.
 wouldn't affect estimate likely effect growth

 MS. SEGER. Jim, could supply dollar

 helps think real GNP change--to look

 net exports expected provide third. reading
 numbers correctly, fourth quarter fourth quarter change

 say third would supplied improvement

 exports].
 Ted's one-third roughly focused growth rate

 MS. SEGER.

 Okay.
 
 Looking $102 billion,
 
 MR. KICHLINE.
 [Our forecast has]: $60 billion personal
 consumption; $7-1/2 billion business fixed investment; virtually
 nothing residential construction; nothing, perhaps billion
 two, business inventories; $28 billion net exports; $5
 billion government purchases.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Okay, thank you.
 
 MR. BLACK. think Martha good point; used

 MR. STERN. Jim, continue problems getting real
 handle budget outlook. see Greenbook
 $180 billion deficit current fiscal year. close
 current CBO baseline, guess $184 billion.
 think number things likely push deficit up,
 starting CBO baseline, heck lot
 likely push down. seems deficit likely
 exceed $180 billion, perhaps considerably.
 
 12/15-16/86
 
 trouble reconciling mentioned might latest
 OMB projections.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 latest OMB projection?
 
 MR. KICHLINE. number floating around still
 preliminary, think, $163 billion current fiscal year.
 That's still subject change it's $160-$165 billion area.
 Keep mind: number matter
 months ago $143 billion; added $20 billion.
 It's
 case much want ante.
 added another $20
 billion.
 think danger going far
 direction, legislative changes enacted
 begin bite. One issues relates defense.
 lot
 defense spending second third quarters last year.

 sense level spending quite high.
 major weapons systems deliveries coming in;
 producing things rapid rate.
 don't expect
 defense spending continue grow real terms fast clip.
 Rather expect, get first part next year,
 probably constraints defense spending--in part
 would
 appropriations cut back Administration's request.
 say wrong, would probably add more; safe
 way go now. big question mark agricultural area;
 substantially dollars Administration.
 experience years even always
 low.
 looks sort outrageous basically turns
 really important issue.
 think pessimistic say
 things weren't done.
 think done. think
 begin show time goes on.
 MR. JOHNSON. One problems defense budget
 initially defense build-up add authority,
 build lot authority system; then, start
 cutting back budget authority, actual outlays start speed
 lot backlog system. go
 quite time.
 strange anomaly:
 actually cutting budget authority see outlays increase.
 happen; know happened times before.
 MR. STERN. something news today
 Administration requesting additional defense funds
 current fiscal year kind quid pro quo modest increase

 adds that-MR. HELLER. nice chart effect

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 You'd make something it?
 
 MR. PRELL. Another facet recent data
 household employment series showing gains strong
 catch up, might well be,
 payroll series.
 could see unemployment rate tick consistent
 pattern seen claims recently.
 MS. SEGER. handled statistically masses
 people middle management get pink slips given
 severance package given psychological treatment two months
 show unemployment
 something help adjust?
 statistics immediately wait apply for-MR. KICHLINE.
 
 don't know answer question.
 
 MR. PARRY. think payroll survey wouldn't show
 up, many companies actually keep
 books maybe three- six-month period.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 see.
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 don't think would show up.
 
 MR. PRELL. gather, though,
 severed, even gotten payment, expect see
 listed unemployed eligible unemployment insurance.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Okay.
 
 may seeing that.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 another question. 10

 MR. TRUMAN. difficult question answer.

 MR. JOHNSON.

 MR. TRUMAN. import side.
 bottom line,
 remember correctly, kept things current level
 maybe two-thirds improvement would go away.
 MR. ANGELL.
 5-1/2 percent?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 import prices moving year
 Actually, little 5
 
 percent.
 MR. ANGELL. import prices moving 1987
 10 percent.
 Now, let's posit would turn
 strong. Let's suppose import prices move next year
 like year; presume means real trade
 doesn't improve much.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Real GNP isn't favorable, would also
 mean slightly better inflation.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 think, net, things would deteriorate.
 
 MR. ANGELL. balance deteriorates.
 that,
 scenario foreign exchange rates remain
 constant, rather depreciating 10 percent, together weakens
 entire-MR. TRUMAN. Right.
 would emphasize, answer Governor
 Johnson's question, number ways view this--that

 Well, international side, said,

 MR. HELLER. May ask different question

 MR. HELLER. Yes.
 would stay away setting explicit

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, range opinion.
 don't
 see anybody saying target traditional type,
 opposed monitoring range.
 make couple observations.
 think repeating people said but--even setting forth
 monitoring range way [in July] debt
 don't think helpful, likely either way

 I'm particularly
 expecting short run but, time, may want tighten

 Obviously,
 nobody oppose study. It's matter way it's stated,
 Mr. Boehne said. However, think say something
 
 12/15-16/86
 
 would useful. probably would something along
 lines--I haven't quite visualized box, that's subsidiary
 point--that think know something Ml behaves
 think probably could say something like:

 somewhat around nominal GNP think nominal GNP--I'm
 sure I'd state quite way--of around 5-1/2 6 percent

 things happened interest rates went

 up, would expect M1 run low, public shouldn't
 surprised that; interest rates declining economy
 soft, would expect M1 run high. inflation down,
 wouldn't disturbed higher figure; inflation rising
 interest rates rising, wouldn't disturbed lower figure.
 Everyone ought understand that's way appraise Ml-as kind supplementary device targets, without

 MR. JOHNSON. wouldn't need three-dimensional graph;
 could one inside other. One would associated

 MR. HELLER.
 
 Make rubber!
 
 MR. ANGELL. One thing might is, without monitoring
 range, suggest Federal Open Market Committee might
 reinstitute quarterly ranges time deemed appropriate.
 would give us chance, case circumstances changed whereby
 believed inflationary tension needed
 correcting, could institute quarterly target without setting
 annual target.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. kind thought
 would mention end suggested: range
 isn't really monitoring range sense used
 term historically; it's statement would expect

 happen somewhat normal conditions.
 thought that, context GNP, velocity, inflation
 rising, Committee would prepared reconsider Ml target-or something like without specific quarterly
 target.
 MR. ANGELL. Even though asked monitoring range,
 happy join consensus.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 Instead monitoring range, maybe better term
 would observation area, something like that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, implicit saying,
 anyway, continue observe Ml.
 don't know exactly
 right wording is, would observe within
 analytic framework, could state it.
 [Unintelligible], I'm
 afraid, unless Mr. Kohn give little reassurance
 gave yesterday.
 MR. KOHN. think model would say it's close one

 Plus one percent, terms velocity.

 MR. BLACK. Don, likely think
