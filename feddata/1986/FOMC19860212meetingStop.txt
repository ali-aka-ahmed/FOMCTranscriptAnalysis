 MR. CROSS.

 [Statements--see
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. exhaustive, comprehensive,
 analytically complete briefing. Now, questions anybody ask?
 MR. MELZER. Jim, current services budget, dawned
 maybe reason market hasn't reacted badly
 long end unconstitutionality aspect Gramm-Rudman
 thinking evolving respect current
 services deficit. Looking 1991, understand it,
 nothing done already table, would
 include fiscal 1987 actions, guess--no doesn't; it's
 fiscal 1986, right? probably wouldn't agree, would
 Seeing CBO

 come similar numbers caught attention.
 MR. KICHLINE. Right, think that's important feature.
 that's different last four five years,
 know, current services estimates shown grow substantially
 $300 billion plus range five years out.
 details available CBO estimates. must say one might
 assume agreement current services estimates
 mean turns wrong. year classic
 case. example, Administration's current services number
 assumes defense baseline 3 percent real growth. Well,
 Gramm-Rudman March 1 cuts, jump spending assume
 spend rate slow. CBO assumes
 Congressional action zero real growth, recent experience
 defense spending much faster Administration [assumption].
 net result 1991 mere $35 billion
 [difference] two defense alone,
 offsetting changes. Interest rates different; worth $20
 $25 billion. Inflation rates substantially different,
 
 2/11-12/86
 
 Administration inflation drifting 2 percent 1991
 hence indexed programs grow much slower rate; current
 services estimates, that's worth something order $25 billion
 1991.
 So, want mix match things
 way, instead 1991 numbers drift essentially
 $100 $110 billion without action probably could
 anything $50 $200 billion perfectly consistent
 numbers. problem, think, great deal
 emphasis notion it's different even without
 action--that budget improving--and think that's
 probably faulty. Hidden behind this, there's lot going on.
 MR. MARTIN.

 MR. KICHLINE.

 bigger question prices.
 Board's quarterly model used

 major way.
 So, effect, fiddled numbers there.

 MR. PARRY.
 
 like model forecast.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Ted, could go chart 17, agricultural
 export chart, again?
 Apparently, you're forecasting increase
 export volume first half 1986, decline, back
 1987.
 MR. TRUMAN. Again, that's partly charts
 done year-over-year basis; reflects fact first
 half 1985 weak.
 fact, looking across 1986 patterns,
 see kind increase presently [unintelligible]
