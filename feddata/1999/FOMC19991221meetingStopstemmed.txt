 mr. ferguson. thank you, mr. chairman. i’d like refer memo

 12/21/99

 becaus, pleasant experi wa, don’t look forward repeat next

 member work group give perspect issu. also,
 go around other, i’d like hear thought balanc-of-risk languag
 element memo, includ languag intermeet move,
 cathi minehan’s propos direct languag, commun
 publicli. hope reason clear. bill pool, let turn you; see bill
 hand memo.
 mr. pool. think enough copi go around you’ll keep pass
 on. want put thought paper allow state thing
 concis. work group’s propos balanc-of-risk languag,
 call option 1, slightli modifi sinc last discuss it. major
 concern last part involv statement committe
 view futur econom condit, want focu on. let go
 point.
 first, think go much easier us agre possibl polici action
 statement concern possibl futur econom condit. second, believ
 option 1 languag implicit phillip curv analyt framework behind
 view everi member committe comfort framework. third,
 think mani market view option 1 languag essenti code
 exist tilt languag--that, fact, read committe view futur polici.
 import us allow percept develop we’re talk code.
 anoth issu, point four, would talk econom condit rather
 futur polici action. truli talk econom condit, take
 committe vote matter--a statement forecast, will. so, think
 market tend view languag econom condit realli code futur
 polici.
 furthermor, concern wai gener public mai
 interpret languag. think invit headlin sai “fed see econom
 weak ahead” vote direct sai see possibl econom weak.
 don’t think go help us.
 
 12/21/99
 
 61
 
 i’m also concern languag option 1 analyt weak.
 success preemptiv, chang econom condit see lead
 us take polici action end dai creat either econom weak
 inflat. that’s whole idea we’re try get across: see possibl
 econom condit that, offset polici action, would gener econom weak
 inflat. want preempt chang economi don’t want occur.
 so, think languag propos option 2 realli accur. chang
 econom condit see develop go gener polici action not,
 fact, gener econom weak inflat.
 lastli, think major work group overreact market’s
 respons announc mai. explicitli told market would
 disclos tilt committe wish “to commun public major shift
 view balanc risk like direct futur polici.”
 surpris market react first us devic said
 would announc tilt someth major sai. fact, sinc mai, think
 market understood us devic much routin basi.
 view respons sinc mai us asymmetr direct
 help reflect overreact.
 so, seven reason strong prefer i’m call
 option 2. must sai wish straight mind 10 12 week ago
 start think it, view evolv we’ve gone along. initi

 i’ve thought it, becom concern option 1 approach.
