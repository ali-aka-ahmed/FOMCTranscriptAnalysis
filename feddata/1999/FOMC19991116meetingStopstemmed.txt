 mr. meyer. comment chairman’s latitud. ed boehn
 talk it, first thing said someth like: cours, chairman must
 author move except case. didn’t see anyth “except case,”
 that’s part problem. hand public statement, think would seem
 convei notion chairman latitud market might expect.
 there’s almost sens encourag chairman review data intermeet
 period make adjust see fit. don’t think interpret someth
 want encourag. decis made fomc meet; that’s best place
 make them. except case, though, it’s import chairman author.
 octob 15th last year perfect exampl us best effect. mai
 understood insid organ, wouldn’t want convei impress outsid
 latitud except case.
 question link de-link, coupl de-coupl. seem
 statement sai decis adjust reflect committe’s discuss

 linkag. committe’s vote symmetri--if committe put statement
 said littl chanc move go necessari--that doesn't mean move
 couldn’t made except case. rais hurdl bit higher would otherwis
 case. wherea thought like risk tilt toward higher
 inflat, would less hurdl data push chairman toward interim
 adjust.
 mr. hoenig. larri, could clarifi posit? sai
