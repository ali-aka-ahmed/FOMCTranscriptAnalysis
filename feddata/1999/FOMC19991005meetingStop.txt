 MR. POOLE. I’d like pursue bit question Bob McTeer raised

 moving direction becoming weaker, given U.S. current account
 substantial deficit. Let focus Japan give back envelope calculation,
 sure correct, convey nature thinking this. Japan, course, large
 current account surplus. instinct large extent reflects fact
 economy weak and, therefore, import demand weaker otherwise would be.
 Let’s suppose--and back envelope calculation fix--that Japan
 operating 10 percent potential terms output, suppose propensity import
 0.15. Japan operating full capacity, imports would 1½ percent GDP higher
 current account surplus would whole lot lower. case yen appreciate would
 weaker current account surplus would suddenly look quite different Japan
 importing whole lot more. Obviously, analysis applies United States well. part,
 deficit current account reflects fact exports weaker anticipated
 many economies around world well. So, although
 true revival abroad raise interest rates abroad effect capital account tend

 broad way, read Greenbook listened staff’s comments morning,
 think description applies national economy well. seems clear point
 economic activity third quarter lot stronger thought going
 discussed August meeting. indications household business spending
 truly robust across board quarter. know, lot spending spilled
 imports, propensity seems intensified recently. current Greenbook
 projects real net exports reduce GDP 1999 1¼ percentage points opposed 1
 percentage point time August meeting. Also, exceptionally strong demand cars
 computing communications equipment revived manufacturing sector
 nicely. level industrial production August, think worth pointing out, 1¼
 percentage points second-quarter average. That’s 4 5 percent annual rate,
 lot! growth aggregate demand continuing outstrip growth
 potential GDP, seems me, straining labor resources. According Greenbook,
 aggregate hours worked currently exceed second-quarter average close percentage
 point--that annualized--and also lot. least, hard see
 trends continue.
 see it, couple things principally allowed economy sustain boom
 situation point without run-up inflation. doubt news you,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. First, let say respect overall
 recommendation, think you’re right “B” indication asymmetry. would join
 Governor Meyer saying--and goes back staff paper came earlier--that
 fact productivity isn’t picking up, clearly want tighten bring supply demand
 closer balance. turns productivity second derivative sense continuing

 higher equilibrium rate interest. sense, hard decision is, ways
 it’s easy decision.
 communications issue, let first tell Committee working group talked
 yesterday asked interim complete
 task. started thought perhaps simply longer vote symmetry
 asymmetry. concerned would two things: (1) prejudging
 outcome (2) putting us position hadn’t really thought implications.
 would rushing something wouldn’t sure communicate
 forth. members working group speak this, think
 uncomfortable third option--announcing we’re thinking therefore
 aren’t voting symmetry asymmetry.

 personal preference, would inclined go direction Governor
 Meyer indicated, quite clear we’ve voted bias toward asymmetry.
 consensus don’t want announce asymmetry let words balance risks
 cover it, would supportive that. reason that, think happened
 first went path, market reaction announcing asymmetry
 particularly jarring. hand, market reaction number statements occurred
 afterwards started get jarring. think learn lesson accurately.
 transparent issue. much more, lack better words, case needing
 bit discipline. think could manage asymmetry announcement
 disciplined Committee. slight preference know--or maybe
 say assume--we continue disciplined. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Third derivative! [Laughter] President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Let start first question symmetry
 asymmetry. think everybody knows views that, I’d like remind everyone
 action August following adoption symmetric directive June 30th.
 symmetric directive doesn’t preclude action. basic assumption
 enough speeches press commentary quotes us signal markets that’s
 necessary. seems happen time.
 question policy objectives, though, it’s one thing high inflation
 environment--whether it’s high, single-digit inflation rate let alone double-digit rate--to bring
 using rhetoric like price stability, zero inflation, terms like that. think it’s quite
 different achieved environment statistical measures somewhere
 zone least words taken mean. makes difficult try find
 way communicating things do. That’s think mostly would
 agree taking anyone’s statistical measure objective policy saying raise this, plus
 minus, would wrong thing do.
 agree we’re productivity surprise positive significant. hope
 continues. I’m willing base policy assumption it’s true. also know
 it’s evenly distributed throughout economy. Certain sectors industries
 pronounced favorable productivity surprises--computers, telecommunications, like. Others
 none all, like marina keep boat, raised fee 10 percent.
 
 10/5/99
 
 58
 
 even negative--declining productivity--because decline quality labor pool
 work forth. doubt true.
 also know favorable productivity surprise, it’s like bumper crop.
 We’re going relative price effect. Relative price effects come either
 decline price products favorable productivity surprises increase price
 things productivity rise or, likely, combination two. question is:
 overall monetary stability prices--on items favorable
 productivity--rise? Clearly not. gold standard, wealth gains manifested
 distributed higher purchasing power money; don’t price rises marina,
 price declines establishment coffee.
 Now, overall, wouldn’t worry much except intermediation
 process. way credit markets work banking system, worry asset price
 increases relative price sense--relative goods prices--when assets financed ways
 make price rises unsustainable. though know second derivative
 positive while, also know second derivative nothing universe positive
 forever. must always go zero negative. worry second derivatives asset
 prices positive--financed banking industry pension funds life insurance
 companies--and prices getting unsustainable levels. inevitable point comes
 second derivative must go zero negative asset prices, people find they’ve
 made mistake credit crunch. debt/deficit cycle
 becomes problem. overall monetary stability zone we’re still leaves us
 challenge. Even projection CPI forecast horizon 1 percent
 rising, would still say challenge achieving overall monetary stability
 sustainable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support “B” asymmetric. want talk disclosure
 issue minute, let first say think “B” right place be. Even though
 uncertainties productivity growth labor force participation, always
 possibility favorable surprises would end lower inflation
 point forecast. don’t think that’s bad outcome, given still believe positive,
 though small, rate inflation economy trend sense.

 although practice many statements might routine boilerplate doesn’t really
 say anything. could try take special ring statement saying
 intend issue statements routinely every meeting. would call

 you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. agree “B” option here. Given two moves we’ve taken
 balancing supply side demand side uncertainties, think “B” right. However,
 believe could undo lot good we’re going “B” decision fooling around
 asymmetry symmetry issue meeting. experience announcing
 asymmetrical directives worked well. may work better future. I’m hopeful
 Roger colleagues come something make work. formal
 asymmetric directive, best confusing tool time want keep open
 options uncertainties what’s going economy, really foolhardy.
 feel strongly ought formal asymmetric directive end

 framework thinking incoming information policy. may well want
 tighten November, may want tighten. don’t think want box
 language use, asymmetric directive runs big risk boxing us in. Words,
 carefully chosen, give slant want without loading dice. time
 want markets know that, yes, may tighten, may not.
 foregone conclusion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, came meeting concluded reading
 staff documentation Bluebook didn’t make strong case tightening
 Greenbook really did. Greenbook projection may wrong I’m prepared
 discount extent think have. believe comments made--I hold
 seat Larry Meyer did--were useful reminder. really do. end
 day, think we’re still very, uncertain what’s happening second derivative

 finally, interested one alternative simulations Greenbook,
 suggested order hold line inflation funds rate needs rise another point.
 probably still time absolutely act, mainly credibility
 currently high, don’t see particular reason delay. doubt going get
 easier tighten policy might get lot harder.
 one point consider quite important, think Larry Meyer
 mentioned. Even right productivity growth continuing accelerate,
 situation increase interest rates necessarily inappropriate. need keep
 mind. If, appears likely, don’t raise rates today stay “B” asymmetric

 directive, strong preference announcing that. would concerned
 trying language. feelings lot people expressed,
 perhaps leanings even strongly. it’s matter credibility. don’t
 announce asymmetry, I’d probably prefer third alternative--just saying we’ve changed rules
 game. first adopted procedure we’re using indicated
 material change would interest markets, would announce it. go back
 stage game would mistake.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, students back Michigan would
 delighted know term “second derivative” crept policy discussions.
 [Laughter] compliment that!
 criticism models, I’ll plead guilty thinking long time terms
 matching aggregate demand fixed predictable levels aggregate supply. nothing
 engraved stone tablet says that’s way it. believe you’re right ought
 get box, will, think new ways view economy. try that.
 It’s possible verge kind shift economic outcomes, also
 way thinking economics. That’s reasonable point put table.
 terms immediate policy considerations, I’m totally waiting see
 happens. would make two points. One harder raise funds rate
 lower it. Secondly, heart--even said new ways thinking
 economics--I would comfortable higher funds rate one now,
 case we’re wrong second derivative issue. make bones that. I’m delighted
 see seems growing consensus act, could act November.
 It’s important get table believe might act November.
 terms today, preference I’ll call straightforward
 asymmetry. I’ll give three reasons that. first rules agreed
 live it’s good idea change procedures we’ve gone process
 considering various alternatives, process going through. don’t think boxes
 us in. pointed statistically asymmetry followed rate increases less
 half time recent past. really don’t accept argument asymmetry boxes us
 in. general matter, think tendency try much language
 would prefer straightforward approach “B” asymmetric.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. announcing publishing it?
 MR. GRAMLICH. announcing it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree recommendation “B”
 asymmetric. certainly agree statement humble ability
 forecast future. We’ve talked this, it’s concern nags us all.
 want note two points forecast thought worth mentioning
 group even though questions forecast. accept Greenbook
 forecast is, thought striking that, alternative scenarios staff presented, core
 CPI 2000 varied 0.1 point, 2.7 2.8 percent. virtually
 difference scenarios. It’s almost baked cake already forecast.
 course, output varies significantly.
 second point adjust core CPI consistent methodological basis going
 backward, 2.7 percent forecast year 2000 highest rate increase core CPI
 since 1992 2.9 percent adjusted basis. So, two points really
 concern look forecast. course, forecast may wrong, know,
 points concern.
 question disclose public, participated discussion
 yesterday Roger Ferguson’s group described effort looking “least worst”
 option among three presented. None really satisfactory point.
 think freeze use tool time working group’s
 report comes make decision we’re going do. slight preference
 recommendation made using language instead tool point. made
 mistake adopted procedure. remember problems used
 last time. would slight preference using language instead actual tool
 asymmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, meeting favored “B” concluded time
 raising rates probably far off. result discussion today, think it’s even
 nearer still would favor alternative B.
 regard symmetry issue, must admit found experience
 encountered--in terms market reaction May press release asymmetry--so distasteful
 
 10/5/99
 
 63
 
 makes want try use words describe views risks outlook.
 Clearly, talking symmetrical situation. I’d like indicate preference use
 words deal issue risks outlook. can’t efficient way,
 certainly could buy announcement asymmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, truly enjoyed lecture moment ago
 publish recommend title “The Rediscovery Say’s Law.” think important us
 give Say’s Law least equal billing Keynes’s Law discussions.
 go-around lot talk favorable temporary factors
 helped us inflation lot petering out. true, still
 believe fundamental factor helping us high-tech boom, petering
 likely peter time soon. That’s general phenomenon. specific
 phenomenon Internet, changing whole world speak. refer
 high-tech boom, I’m talking high-tech electronics, helping GDP numbers.
 high-biotech also raising standard living ways probably don’t improve
 numbers. may even perverse effect numbers. Cures diseases, prevention
 diseases, shorter hospital stays may generate less GDP diseases would.
 Another huge development yet, even though going almost
 decade, collapse communism hard core socialism around world. fact
 many countries many workers part world market economy
 before. even hasn’t involved lowering iron curtain, lowering
 protectionist curtain--in Latin America, example. big, new, world
 lots new people. There’s lot catching do, lot consolidations going on,
 lot privatization. still excess capacity many places around world,
 including United States. We’ve adding capacity faster we’ve using it.
 feel good prospects progress inflation.
 know current account deficit large don’t want rely forever
 capital inflows augment domestic savings. true strong country leads strong
 currency, premier country revolution. think it’s unreasonable expect
 dollar generally remain strong continue give us benefits strong currency
 inflation battle.

 policy decision today, suspect it’s surprise like “B” alternative
 change. view we’ve three tightenings already. first announcement
 asymmetric directive, probably harm markets two tightening
 moves we’ve had. think created monster new disclosure policy way
 worded policy. still new, everybody--especially market participants--knows
 it’s working well. would seem reasonable us announce it’s
 working expected, going reassess it--we formed subcommittee
 reassess it--and subcommittee reports, we’re going releasing
 information symmetry directive. would go even suggest
 Committee decide bury later on. Ed Boehne said believe Bob Parry said, still
 use words communicate anything want. could use opportunity get
 box we’re announcing directive, would good thing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. words announcing decision asymmetry,
 would choose? I’m trying get sense everyone formulate proposal
 vote. seemed imply three variations, least desirable publish
 asymmetry. second option would asymmetry publish it, use words
 describe it. first you’re opposed to?
 MR. MCTEER. I’m third--to suspend use thus announcements symmetry
 asymmetry. think it’s tie first second options. I’ll go along
 whatever decide question. think miss great opportunity get rid
 bogeyman don’t now. would great time say working way
 intended we’re going study it. announce today change
 target fed funds rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m sure there’s majority position stage.
 MR. MCTEER. Well, heard eloquent argument! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Touché! President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. listened arguments great interest,
 persuasive. time, view still move

 important imbalances economy that, addressed now, result better
 economic performance long term. take advantage opportunity now. Also,
 extent productivity increases positive terms second derivative

 continuing, act address imbalances affect strong
 gains. keep mind consider monetary policy today.
 issue symmetry, personally would like leave directive symmetric.
 reason don’t think major change attitude. last two times
 met, increased rates. We’re obviously alert possible need firming. We’re aware
 today. don’t take action today doesn’t mean we’re concerned
 been, especially data come out. However, asymmetric way Committee
 wishes go, think we’re stew terms announcing. law unintended
 consequences manifest somewhat bound announce
 leaning, although tell original announcement say we’re necessarily
 going disclose decision symmetry. that’s many people read. think
 we’re compelled way would suggest disclose decision go
 asymmetric. think we’d wise go asymmetric.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, favor alternative B. Let take
 seconds say why. First all, said earlier morning, relatively optimistic
 productivity, gives confidence going forward. Secondly, optimism assuages
 concerns inflationary pressures. simply don’t think case significant
 acceleration inflation convincing point. thirdly, believe
 little time. moved funds rate up. markets, especially long-term markets,
 moved rates even more. think wait see brings. So, favor “B.”
 symmetry versus asymmetry issue, normally favor symmetry, that’s true today.
 it’s big deal me. go asymmetric, given procedures set up,
 say something it. would come Ned Gramlich did. Probably least bad
 alternative circumstances publish it. Also, think markets--or
 participants market--are probably expecting asymmetry. Several people commented
 along lines. it’s probably bad idea remind people door closed
 far November meeting Committee concerned.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. listened go-around, found
 identifying would preferred go ahead tighten today.
 comfortable supporting “B” asymmetric, basically three reasons. First all, context
 
 10/5/99

 we’ve talked today also number reasons, I’m delighted
 window still appears open action November. Secondly, abnormally
 strong flow data coming relatively brief period time
 November meeting, great benefit us. Thirdly, part
 reason supporting “B,” opinion. talked yesterday Roger Ferguson’s
 working group, beginning feel--I don’t think alone view--that could
 counterproductive something new way today. would ad hoc. haven’t
 really thought terms we’re going want wind up.
 importantly, market prepared all. would introduce additional
 complication time don’t need additional complications. could induce
 considerable confusion, possibly volatility, unfortunate speculation. I’d careful
 something new different departure past practices. think
 would highly undesirable. market beginning become little
 comfortable procedures recently adopted, change fly scares
 me.
 call for? change directive represents change
 Committee’s central thinking if, believe, consensus “B” asymmetric.
 think straightforward way handle would adopt asymmetric directive,
 announce public, append brief explanation statement.

 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, could enthusiastic

 probably time, productivity improvements seem
 momentum deeply engrained way economy running right now. It’s also good
 action November continues possibility. support “B.”
 also feel start change process communicate asymmetry
 --and think communicate feel balance risks--the outcome
 won’t beneficial. introduce another level surprise uncertainty market.
 may markets reacted badly announcement asymmetry last May,
 discussed. I’d rather stick language firm view way go
 forward communicate confidence. So, I’d go along Governors
 Gramlich Kelley others around table “B” asymmetric, using customary
 language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, identify closely comments Cathy Minehan
 made Ed Kelley Ned Gramlich earlier. earlier comments, indicated
 came meeting notion would comfortable another modest
 tightening move today. Even discounting forecast genetic tendency worry--and
 even factoring reminder productivity--I think one could still make case
 another modest tightening would perhaps cleanest, honest, expeditious way get
 policy appropriate place. comfortable policy action today.
 colleague across table reminded us last week, others commented, world
 going come end meetings--especially we’re open considering policy action
 November.
 also came meeting thinking worst worlds kind

 MR. JORDAN. question something wasn’t raised discussion

 June 30th action words seemed convey different messages
 got varying market responses.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One things I’d like ask Ferguson working
 group whether perhaps expedite report possible. long discussion-MR. FERGUSON. it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. report Committee beginning

 MR. FERGUSON. think probably report next meeting.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, given President McDonough’s earlier comments
 sense this, necessary spend much time labor markets press release?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Strangely enough, consequence President
 McDonough’s remarks, put additional words emphasize key question
 inflation potential undermining impressive performance economy.
 MR. HOENIG. Right. could take labor market reference?
 MR. MEYER. ought careful. sense causality here;

 MR. HOENIG. I’m convinced.
 MR. GUYNN. One comment. People continue pound question:
 you’re looking at? way worded, essentially tells people watch one
 statistic one part economy, whether behaves misbehaves guide
 actions. think it’s complicated that. wouldn’t want limit

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, say need especially
 alert months ahead potential cost increases could lead inflation pressures.

 MR. MEYER. disagree that. Take situation cost increases

 MR. MCTEER. colleagues won’t want either.
 MR. BOEHNE. It’s hard re-edit statement 55 minutes press time, think

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Adjust Chairman said declare victory!
 MR. BOEHNE. Let’s quickly adjourn! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. everybody’s benefit, opinion writing
 press release committee productive way it, crucial one. Let
 reread sure everyone feels comfortable. “The Federal Open Market Committee
 decided today leave target federal funds rate unchanged.” That’s straightforward.
 “Strengthening productivity growth fostering favorable trends unit costs
 prices, much recent information suggests trends sustained. Nonetheless,
 growth demand continued outpace supply, evidenced decrease
 pool available workers willing take jobs.” We’re saying that’s cause it; that’s
 merely measure it. “In circumstances, Federal Open Market Committee need
 especially alert months ahead potential cost increases significantly excess
 productivity manner could contribute inflation pressures undermine impressive
 performance economy.” Okay?
 SPEAKER(?). That’s fine!
 MR. KELLEY. Yes, sir.
 MR. BOEHNE. don’t toss copies middle table get fresh

 MR. KOHN. read “cost increases significantly” rather “costs increase”?
