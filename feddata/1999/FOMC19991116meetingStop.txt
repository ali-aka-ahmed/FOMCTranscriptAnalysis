 credibility hold water, Europe would sensitive shortterm rates long-term, otherwise decline long-term yields
 would undermine restraining influence short-term rates. throughout
 career current events, colleagues Europe always told
 Europe sensitive long-term rates silly Anglo Saxon
 economies focused short-term rates. So, quite sure
 credibility argument plays either.
 Looking United Kingdom, it’s intriguing 10-year gilt yield

 obviously, see subsequent auctions go.

 Another way might avoid deterioration would 4 percent

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions?
 MR. JORDAN. Mike, mentioned oil prices spiking. reading

 writing forecast price going back $5 barrel, 25 percent so.
 Oil prices among many things absolutely confidence ability

 outlook that, lot volatile personalities still powerful
 positions places world produce oil. So, predict happen?
 Suppose draw straight line assume next two years, forecast horizon,
 oil prices remain today. would implications that?
 MR. PRELL. good question one precise
 answer. anticipate plummeting oil prices; gradual decline two
 years. level clearly moved since established assumption; oil prices rose
 Greenbook published. still downward tilt futures markets, though
 maybe quite sharp earlier. futures price still pretty high
 next several months. prices remain now, would add least
 little core inflation rate, particularly 2001. think would create night-and-day

 Secondly, widened enormously--although obviously written anywhere

 Moreover, range average prospective wage increases cited Beigebook contacts rose

 faster wage growth next year. view consistent anecdotal information

 Changing gears different topic, want emphasize view asymmetry

 strong incoming data, market rates moved up. data came benign later
 intermeeting period, rates moved back down. think asymmetry precisely we,
 least I, expected do. That’s want say point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Using orthodox reasoning, think
 case tightening policy meeting could made fairly readily. flat funds rate
 version Greenbook forecast aggregate demand growing rate nearly 5 percent
 half year nearly 4 percent next two years. Starting position labor
 markets already tight, demand growth even upgraded estimate
 potential GDP growth. represents little much demand pressure even new
 economy would seem call tightening policy trim pressure.
 last meeting, Mr. Chairman, challenged us think economy
 new ways. I’m afraid don’t new way thinking aggregate demand
 aggregate supply, new way think monetary policy--one
 talked much room one sweeping globe outside room.
 inflation targeting, monetary approach I’m told used 44 countries.
 countries inflation targeting seemed successful controlling inflation.
 many seemed successful limiting output variation well.
 
 11/16/99
 
 35
 
 First, inflation targeting itself, one get fairly logical progression.
 idea monetary targeting ran difficulty shocks liquidity demand.
 shocks made difficult interpret growth monetary aggregates. growth mean
 economy overheating simply upward shift demand
 liquidity? next step move nominal income targeting, approach many still
 favor. shocks, time productivity. nominal income growing
 rapidly, mean economy overheating simply productivity risen?
 Given shocks, one might reasonably conclude central bank target inflation
 directly. Inflation trying stabilize, stabilize it.
 One could use either model non-model approach inflation targeting.
 present circumstances, Greenbook model approach clearly suggests tightening policy.
 Acceleration inflation occurs gradually flat funds rate version Greenbook forecast
 would take fairly emphatic tightening policy stop it. know, occurs
 economy operating Greenbook’s estimate NAIRU. sure,
 growing professional doubt estimate. early 1997, Staiger, Stock,

 Perry built coefficients follow random walk time constrained

 present unemployment rates. papers controversial, that’s point. may
 make sense look ways target inflation.
 Turning nonstructural approaches, preemptive lags
 monetary policy. event, nonstructural approaches would involve finding leading
 indicators forecasts inflation Fed move basis signals.
 Unfortunately, many good leading indicators. One call “pipeline”
 indicator core PPI. latest numbers index reassuring; core PPI

 core total PPI. don’t figure here, would similarly
 reassuring. Given likely fall dollar strength world commodity prices,
 reflected core PPI, could even price pressure pipeline.

 It’s always risky generalize monthly numbers, would still consider data
 suggesting policy tightened.
 approach might look inflation forecasts others.
 Greenbook Part II useful information page II-34. past three years now,
 consumer surveys Michigan expected rise inflation, meaning forecast
 inflation current rates. hand, median forecast inflation

 forecaster, not. surveyed Philadelphia Fed also expected
 inflation actually occurred past years. Again, forecasters raised

 overlapping group. Blue Chip forecasters look particularly big rise inflation
 seem forecasting Fed tighten policy slightly
 prevent rise. end forecasts inflation help us much, though may
 weak vote tightening policy.
 leave us? me, structural model approach inflation
 targeting suggests rather clearly ought tighten. pipeline approach suggests
 somewhat clearly, approach consulting forecasters gives weak vote.
 intensity varies, indicators point one direction, however, inclined
 think point way, too.

 major new factors emerged period source

 markets continues anything markets tightened even further. Unemployment,
 stable around 4¼ percent level maybe little lower, clearly ticked
 again. time, percent population labor force want jobs
 also declined. labor force participation rate remained tight range around 67
 percent since March 1998, quite unusual think strong economy.
 suggests perhaps supply available workers indeed nearly exhausted,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. wish note governor literally onehanded economist. [Laughter] Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. time morning
 needs said already said. let briefly summarize see state play
 offer several comments hope might useful move toward policy
 formulation.
 seems clear economy remains strong, lot ongoing momentum.
 True, see better defined indications slowing activity, housing apparently
 topping quite possibly autos well. air pockets may well appear,
 momentum remains impressive. New jobs continue created substantial number, driving
 unemployment even further. Consumer sentiment rebounded brief

 year 2000 election year generally strong. Inflation remains quiescent. One
 always look signs serious potential weaknesses slowdown,
 ever-present danger shocks it’s hard identify many looming forecast period.
 short, risks seem distinctly upside.
 formulation key question us is: might today’s
 healthy strength deteriorate unhealthy overheating? obvious second question
 addressed shortly is: policy today likely beneficial year now?
 Let make several quick observations. First all, stronger world growth highly
 desirable. However, complicate inflation outlook. lower dollar, stronger export
 demand, higher level world resource utilization put new upward pressures
 price level. important reversal favorable disinflationary impact got
 weaker world past several years.
 Second, baseline Greenbook forecast calls tightening forecast
 period still projects rising rate inflation 2000. case made--but
 me--that rate inflation likely reached fourth quarter 2001 would still
 within acceptable limits, I’m concerned rising trend might imply policy.
 Committee could required make strong tightening moves counter it.
 Finally, apparently strong growth rate productivity improvement,
 Chairman’s second derivative. served us wonderfully well. going forward
 here, parameters likely impact? one end spectrum improvement
 could continue period time, Chairman observed
 indefinitely, overheating potentially subsequent condition. end,
 probability may low, could disappear soon could find scrambling
 avoid consequences. perhaps highest probability rate change
 remain positive strong enough hold cost increases resulting
 stronger world growth, wealth effect, ever tighter labor markets. earlier
 stronger rise prices could result.

 inflation expectations seem unlikely increase much near term way

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Don? not, let get started.
 interesting questions raised around table today around lot tables
 participated discussions last month two. coming across
 quite remarkable divergence opinions. example, around table are, group,
 much concerned upside inflationary pressures; must say I’m
 comfortable elsewhere. sit around Business Council table,
 tell pricing power nonexistent, ability offset cost increases
 limit, margins reasonably good shape, evidence
 inflationary pressures lot us talking about. Business Round Table members
 gave story. question people looking elephant
 viewing quite dramatically different ways. believe reason something
 fundamentally important going economy, one evaluates critical
 one comes end respect policy.
 bottom line today, frankly, benefits moving outweigh
 standing pat. However, think issue complex. First, side less
 inclined move, growing evidence interest-sensitive areas economy
 beginning slow, least margin. Motor vehicles, big industry lot
 areas around country, quite soft October, Chairman General Motors said
 views market motor vehicles really quite weak. calls made
 
 11/16/99
 
 46
 
 industry contacts concerning November sales indicate little change October
 data. So, far first half month concerned, evident rebound.
 don’t know whether you’ve picked thing, President Moskow, that’s
 sources tell us.
 housing market little difficult assess. seen significant
 decline peak starts sales. obvious cause increase mortgage rates,
 though backed recent highs. afternoon National Association
 Homebuilders going put early November survey builders; numbers show
 bounce-back housing sales currently next six months. Conversely,
 private survey larger builders National Association Homebuilders made
 available us shows sales remained weak October. know official numbers
 September sharply--and probably certain sense little noncredibly, since
 markets don’t move sharply numbers suggest. Nonetheless, think safe argue
 general softening occurring interest-sensitive areas economy. That’s
 saying could rebound. rebound happened before, think wait
 see materializes.
 productivity side, data anything continue strongly supportive
 increasing rates productivity gains. morning’s industrial production index month
 October, put productivity terms extrapolated rest quarter,
 engenders quarterly output per hour growth figure 7.6 percent annual rate. Two
 months quarter forecasts, level October already high.
 think seen note distributed Larry Slifman productivity
 data updated third quarter. yet details Commerce
 put together detailed tables need full compilation numbers
 usually send out. Nonetheless, it’s quite interesting product side official number
 nonfarm business productivity 2.9 percent third quarter third quarter
 last year. That’s obviously significant acceleration. income side, reflecting
 sharp widening statistical discrepancy last year, number increase
 productivity 4.2 percent, year-over-year. addition, recognize conceptually
 consistent denominator calculation business productivity work hours
 reported household survey instead establishment survey, 4.2 percent number
 
 11/16/99
 
 47
 
 income side moves 4.4 percent. need keep mind household
 survey hours worked one that’s truly internally consistent unemployment
 rate. distinction quite important currently because, indicated last meeting,
 difference excess 50,000 month changes indicated conceptually
 identical definitions household nonfarm business versus payroll employment. result
 getting quite different estimates productivity. official data indicate 2.9 percent
 increase four quarters, use conceptual framework change
 numerator denominator, end 4.4 percent. choice
 Commerce makes low end range whose upper limit suggestive far greater
 acceleration.
 It’s really quite interesting find escalation productivity far
 pronounced, terms second derivative speak, use income side measure
 output household survey measure hours make calculations past
 several years--indeed, going back 1980s. give case point, estimate
 using income side household hours data decade 1980s indicates

 third quarter 1999, number 4½ percent, 4 times. Cyclically adjusted,
 number marginally lower. something profoundly important happened here.
 question interpreted.
 One thing important interpret whether accelerating productivity engenders
 stable economic system. answer is, fact, not, it’s regard
 accelerating productivity exerts upward pressure real long-term rates. reason
 get accelerating income-side supply-side growth propensity consume
 income engendered unchanged, arithmetically end demand equal
 supply. unemployment rate change. associated inflation pressures
 nonexistent. problem fact productivity accelerating
 presumed underlying cause acceleration change long-term outlook
 corporate earnings existing fixed discount rate, expectation higher earnings
 engender increase stock market wealth. necessity wealth effect--and
 dispute New York Bank Board staff--we invariably get
 
 11/16/99
 
 48
 
 decline propensity save income. So, end need satisfy
 aggregate demand excess domestic supply.
 meeting demand two ways. One increasing share
 imports relative total demand. increased productivity root cause,
 uptrend technology, much higher rate expected earnings new projects.
 long run, rise expected earnings major factor facilitating
 widening current account deficit latter readily financed, one tell
 fact dollar hasn’t gone anywhere. net import-export balance, current
 account want put way, recently adding close full percentage point
 aggregate supply available satisfy domestic demand. Second, seen continued
 decline pool unemployed workers currently seeking job saying wish
 work. Employers willing hire new workers even though productivity
 somewhat less average. employment workers added another ½
 percentage point GDP growth. source labor together higher imports
 gap aggregate demand aggregate supply closed statistically last
 several years.
 Clearly, neither adjustment processes continue. consequence,
 ending demand exceeding supply equivalent, investment ex ante
 exceeding saving ex ante. pressure move investment saving together induces rise
 real long-term interest rates. rise long-term interest rates quite significant
 recently. Rates U.S. Treasuries risen somewhat less percentage point since
 Asian crisis, spread BBB-rated obligations versus Treasuries widened.
 judging rise inflation rate expectations, point I’m using TIPS
 measure inflation expectations, substantial rise real BBB corporate
 yields, close average yield corporations pay.
 think process restraint clearly begun work, behavior housing
 motor vehicles suggests. trouble lags invariably quite long,
 know much long-term rate tightening required bring supply demand balance.
 Since real rates rising long, presumption adjustment process
 fairly well established fact stock market unchanged last six
 months another indication pressure there.
 
 11/16/99
 
 49
 
 result market adjusting essentially
 --I don’t know word be--let’s call “unbalanced” expansion
 engendered accelerating productivity. reason acceleration creates imbalances
 basically wealth effect. extent real long-term rates rising,
 wealth effect increases neutralized reduced experiencing slow
 adjustment process toward equilibrium balance. never seen anything like
 phenomenon century best knowledge. may happened previous
 century huge changes technology occurred hundred years ago,
 data would enable us evaluate happening virtually nonexistent.
 problem think setting monetary policy relationship
 raised previous meeting Governor Gramlich, namely relationship shortterm real rates long-term real rates. best tell, gap point,
 especially move funds rate another 25 basis points today,
 large. words, slight upward tilt real yield curve means one
 would suggest inflationary imbalance would infer steep yield curve.
 don’t curve point. agree Vice Chair. don’t think
 behind curve, don’t think markets saying are. indeed
 implication forward markets anticipate modest increase rates
 part, looking much sort evidence.
 bottom line really know system works. It’s clearly
 new. old models working. reasons working essentially
 rapidly changing structure whose parameters difficult estimate, and,
 therefore, depend part anecdotal information part sort risk
 evaluation. particular stage, convinced hourly earnings data saw
 last employment report--like 2.7 percent rate increase last three months--were
 real position move December, would say could take chance
 wait December meeting. 2.7 percent number best judge real
 adjust mix, turns figure 2.7 percent; it’s 4 percent. Now,
 4 percent great consequence productivity strong is. look
 total compensation per hour, figures closer 5 percent, unit labor costs
 accelerating; indeed, declining.
 
 11/16/99
 
 50
 
 think issue import prices per se huge consequence largely
 explain disinflation wholly terms gross product originates internally.
 Import prices effect domestic prices indirect. I’m saying
 effect there. I’m saying it’s tough evaluate. I’m little concerned price
 oil. Even though it’s clearly long-term interest major Gulf producers keep
 price keep competition sources down, need remember
 large oil reserves. it’s quite easy demonstrate long-term
 interest allow value reserves decline, would
 sharp increase price oil short run owing loss market share. difficulty
 Gulf producers also severe fiscal debt problems. always
 inclination OPEC producers agree price West Texas Intermediate decline
 to, say, $18 barrel agree decline happen eventually. isn’t nice
 get $25 barrel! revenues coming in. long run wait mañana.
 indeed serious potential problem here: Even though importance oil U.S.
 economy gone quite significantly importance energy generally gone
 share GDP, oil still potentially quite destabilizing effect, especially
 consumer confidence.
 conclusion, think lot uncertainties stage bottom line
 long continuing decline total number people unemployed,
 including currently seeking job, telling us growth demand exceeds
 growth supply. gap two closing. open
 level quite significant period time. showed early signs narrowing
 last year, reopened. judgment, long gap can’t move
 December, much risky us stand pat time. possibilities sorts
 problems move interest rates up, think risks currently less usual.
 would prefer see somewhat greater anticipation tightening move financial markets,
 don’t think critical factor.
 consequence, let end saying would like put table 25
 basis point increase today symmetric directive. symmetry case almost
 automatic sense effectively saying going move December.
 Indeed, short significant set surprises, it’s credible would risk
 
 11/16/99

 commotion close century date change. Therefore, would like reactions
 25 basis point move plus shift symmetry. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree fully
 reasoning behind recommendation recommendation itself. agree
 increase funds rate 25 basis points. think must symmetric create
 uncertainty financial markets end-of-the-year period, markets always
 somewhat illiquid. Given Y2K effect year-end markets, simply would good
 public policy us creating confusion kind situation. “C” symmetric seems
 exactly right conclusion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. find going 25 basis points symmetric directive
 acceptable. think whether move today close enough call reasonable people
 differ, difference little one prefers one finds acceptable
 fairly close together. actually feel strongly need symmetric directive.
 gone extraordinary lengths try get year-end period Y2K
 business. us asymmetric directive face would look right
 hand doesn’t know left hand doing. think want err side calming

 strongly symmetric directive find 25 basis points acceptable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. agree recommendation funds rate and, course,
 symmetric directive. pleased hear interested analysis
 productivity changes, especially positive direction, secondary effects one puts

 MR. BROADDUS. agree recommendation, Mr. Chairman. think

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.

 think one could make distinction economics associated asymmetry

 persuaded we’re better symmetric directive reasons President Boehne
 articulated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. I’d like offer two
 observations. First, terms low inflation expectations lack pricing power, that’s
 market trusts us contain inflation. And, therefore, can’t use low inflation
 expectations good signal might time move. start lose trust,
 gotten behind. haven’t lost we’re behind. Secondly, data
 come perfectly benign, right center point forecasts, doesn’t really matter
 whether move today not. seems what’s important we’ve
 positioned get data high side, greater strength activity

 end January. would risk getting behind. There’s plenty room rates go
 data come soft side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. accept recommendation, Mr. Chairman. Although think
 chance action may unnecessary, doubt harmful. Let
 reiterate uncertainty appropriate model environment. seems
 many conventional models we’ve looking last several
 years simply wrong critical issue acceleration inflation. think
 need bear mind.
 alternative explanation, undoubtedly also oversimplified, we’ve seen

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, think recommendations ¼ point
 increase funds rate symmetric directive prudent, support them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. support recommendations 25 basis point increase
 symmetric directive. Let say one thing process. November meeting Bill
 McDonough mentioned awkward timing regular December meeting Bob Parry
 intimated concern also. So, point might look meeting
 schedule. late December meeting doesn’t seem help us much might better
 
 11/16/99
 
 54
 
 way arrange meeting schedule wouldn’t making policy long
 period time. think that’s something whoever schedule might take account.
 Let also comment economic model, liked it’s good way
 tie together two imbalances often talk about, labor market imbalance
 saving/investment imbalance. strikes least two implications that.
 One given saving/investment imbalance, natural reason ought
 look increases long-term interest rates even apart table.
 Greenbook touched this, think it’s something ought talk more.
 second tying together two imbalances may actually uncover reason haven’t

 becomes less true, might worry even inflation. going back
 issue table, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation ¼ point
 increase funds rate accept recommendation symmetric directive.
 problem this: want convey markets view little chance
 would make additional move February meeting, don’t
 particularly want convey markets feel we’ve done much
 necessary, we’ve rebalanced risks, it’s likely thereafter rates go
 go up. really want avoid turning tightening appears
 easing. We’ve problem before. Now, could make case it’s hard
 convey actually mean announcement. could argue could go asymmetric
 tell market asymmetry doesn’t mean period leading century
 date change tighten reflects policy tilt would place thereafter.
 accept symmetry, want raise issue need careful
 convey message announcement. we’ve put added burden announcement,
 okay long use effectively.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.

 concern, I’ll leave that. So, terms statement, I’m agreement Governor Meyer.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, like presentation
 exists. Let say why. think second paragraph included say
 certain point run resources likely resource we’re going run
 available workers. also share Bob McTeer’s view. fascinating article last
 Sunday’s New York Times mentally challenged people jobs; think that’s
 wonderful. real world certain point, drawing available pool
 workers continues, run workers, think paragraph states
 sensible way. third paragraph good central banker words last
 words second line “appears likely.” don’t make theologically dogmatic
 statement. like says growth business;
 business allowing American economy grow fast supply side economy
 makes possible. think something need say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. would like associate Larry Meyer’s comment;
 concern. don’t know substitute language offer, perhaps something
 along lines “after taking three actions, think sufficient time
 continued vigilance needed” opposed something sense finality it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 
 11/16/99

 MR. BOEHNE. Mr. Chairman, us sat write statement,
 undoubtedly would come somewhat different language somewhat different
 emphases. But, frankly, we’d little differently, think close enough
 ought accept move next item agenda. It’s G-7
 trouble this. you’ve around Committee long enough, know we’ve
 tried times past edit draft language Committee tell effort
 totally unproductive. believe attitude largely left
 Chairman. think something broadly acceptable, view
 draft broad area acceptability ought go it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. great deal sympathy President Boehne said.
 know rewriting committee really hard do, done
 things less importance statement. two real concerns. First all, share
 Bob McTeer’s concern using pool available workers proximate cause
 change. think could say something like, “as consequence, tighter policy necessary
 inflationary imbalances remain check,” etc. Secondly, agree Governor Meyer
 time frame issue. Certainly, second sentence paragraph says near term,
 think first sentence going give markets real reason rejoice take things
 new heights next couple months. Unless find qualifying words
 sentence--and don’t think “likely” it--we’re going real issues markets.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, sympathetic much said
 around table, particularly President McTeer’s views Governor Meyer
 President Minehan. really believe Ed Boehne right, cannot
 Committee. hope find ways make changes draft
 accommodate views expressed. But, basically, think leave
 hear rest us say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Let associate Mike Kelley’s Ed Boehne’s
 comments. know, I’ve working hard many think
 best this. [Laughter]
 
 11/16/99
 
 59
 
 MS. MINEHAN. it!
 MR. FERGUSON. it! substantive way, I’ve read
 four five times people commented it, without question words
 one could change. reality try change words, we’d end
 gobbledygook. message clear. might like every word,
 generally reflects heard went around table. particular respect
 symmetry issue, says going focus near term symmetric.
 mind doesn’t say it’s over. think terms process terms
 substance, Committee much better leaving statement pretty much
 rather trying change it. Perhaps Chairman want edit slightly there,
 would cautious going path seem headed. I’ve spent
 last intermeeting period trying think way way it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, understand difficulty trying something
 committee, ultimately think defer language this.
 find first sentence third paragraph troublesome. think could delete
 sentence modify following sentence directive symmetry, we’d
 right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. really agree Ed Boehne’s point, can’t resist! [Laughter]
 MR. BOEHNE. That’s problem!
 MR. STERN. So, let make couple constructive suggestions. One
 regard reference pool workers second paragraph. would drop
 sentence. Whether we’ve said not, don’t think really matters; don’t know
 we’d want raise again. comment next sentence, first sentence
 next paragraph. think way qualify phrase “appears likely” bit
 markets don’t get carried away.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s continue go around. suggestions
 resolve issue.
 MR. GRAMLICH. yield. What’s suggestion? [Laughter]
 
 11/16/99
 
 60
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First, let say think second paragraph
 essential it’s trying convey recognition one hand economy showing
 least signs slowing hand pool available workers
 drawn down. measure gap supply demand. It’s best
 measure that’s we’re hanging on.
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, may I? [Laughter] objection
 saying trend must contained. referred unsustainable trend, think
 would serve purpose little milder.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, unsustainable trend contained.
 MR. MCTEER. sentence implies we’re going stop decline
 pool available workers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh no, market is. Market forces-MR. MCTEER. Well, it’s market issuing press release.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. argument Chairman
 made consistently happen think he’s right.
 MR. MCTEER. do, too. know it’s going come end. process
 limits.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. It’s important whether think he’s
 right not, Chairman Committee. something like weren’t
 statement, think Lynn Fox would get 85 phone calls first hour asking available
 pool workers. Don’t worry anymore? think
 consistent Chairman’s recent speeches.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I’m worried comparison
 speeches. anyone else want comment make great recommendation? think
 there’s legitimate question third paragraph it’s substantive issue. rest
 comments, think, analytical. alternative go back something
 similar August release mild editing. suggested language would read
 follows: “Today’s increase federal funds rate, together policy actions June
 August firming conditions generally U.S. financial markets recent

 SEVERAL. That’s better.
 MR. MEYER. would better take “markedly.”
 MR. BROADDUS. better get rid that.
 MS. MINEHAN. Take “markedly” out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, it’s real interest rate issue think
 relevant. Listening discussion, strikes adequate solution problem.
 don’t that?
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, could make minor suggestion?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Certainly.
 MR. PRELL. referred firming conditions financial markets “over
 recent months,” there’s much discussion slight easing recently.
 changed “over course year” something like that, wording might accord
 better facts.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think that’s reasonable suggestion. Okay, don’t
 substitute rewording third paragraph? satisfactory everybody?
 really! Let put way. definition can’t satisfactory everybody,
 shouldn’t care. [Laughter]
 MR. BOEHNE. shouldn’t drafts floating around. suppose ought
 turn back in.
 MR. PRELL. Throw middle table!
 SPEAKER(?). Pass me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Board Governors going take short recess
 vote discount rate change. Luncheon available. we’re finished we’ll come
 back session. FOMC meeting continue Roger Ferguson distributed
 memo disclosure issues us consider. We’re obviously going complete
 discussion topic today, think it’s bad idea spend little time it.
 Remember, we’re assuming we’re going make policy moves December,
 resolution disclosure issues really necessary time. probably
 worthwhile try make progress resolving them.
 
 11/16/99
 
 62
 
 [Lunch recess]
 MR. FERGUSON. don’t mind, don’t get going even though still
 food eat. Let start saying would like discuss part
 meeting reaction entire Committee November 10th memo came
 me. signed memo behalf whole Working Group Directive Disclosure
 Policy reflects number points consensus group. points
 slight divergences within Working Group itself, points
 memo may reflect broadly views Committee whole.
 Let explain would like try do. Chairman indicated,
 first chance discuss issues last. necessarily
 look toward trying reach formal vote anything sort today. simply first
 opportunity whole Committee look Working Group done give us
 feedback.
 Secondly, elements draft language and,
 possible, would prefer focus details wording yet. Let’s try keep
 conversation conceptual level now.
 Thirdly, number points agreement points
 clear agreement among members Working Group. would helpful
 would give general sense views points 1 9
 agreement. focus bit comments wording
 sentences symmetry asymmetry, starts page 4 memo, would useful.
 Again, I’m talking specific wording two concepts laid out.
 preamble, let tell consensus emerge. think
 strong consensus Working Group immediate announcement every
 FOMC meeting, even it’s rather perfunctory. announcement would convey
 Committee’s basic thinking would include expression views going forward;
 symmetry/asymmetry shorthand we’re using here. Secondly, strong consensus
 FOMC every meeting vote intended fed funds rate
 symmetry asymmetry, exactly today. So, points involve
 maintaining status quo. third point agreement operating paragraph
 longer contain sentence referring Committee’s consensus symmetry
 
 11/16/99
 
 63
 
 asymmetry. theory case operating paragraph really meant direct
 Desk behavior intermeeting period; nothing specific
 symmetry/asymmetry clear directive Desk, though may provide context.
 fourth point general consensus reached, meeting
 Working Group anyway, FOMC’s vote draft copy announcement
 would passed governors presidents, opportunity offer
 substantive reactions. came out. decide pass
 draft announcements prior vote. concern focus vote policy
 would much heavily weighted draft words opposed actual substance
 policy. seemed though focus voting policy draft
 wording.
 sixth point think agreement directive
 shortened eliminate backward-looking material describing recent developments.
 seventh issue reached agreement directive continue
 released Thursday next FOMC meeting earlier. tie
 number eight, minutes also continue released Thursday
 next FOMC meeting earlier. rationale there, clear,
 twofold. One process producing minutes time consuming, makes
 difficult actually get minutes much earlier now. Secondly, think
 strong sense group Committee speak meeting
 cycle, twice, thereby avoid Committee actively engaged, will,
 market deliberations periods meetings.
 ninth point agreement clearer way describing
 Chairman’s latitude make intermeeting moves. theory had, discussing
 Virgil Mattingly, language Committee could adopt
 organizing meeting late January-early February every year would clearly outline
 Chairman’s latitude making intermeeting policy moves. reason becomes
 important number people looked symmetry asymmetry language
 giving guidance latitude Chairman act behalf Committee,
 thought better clear authority. Again, suggested wording
 memo.
 
 11/16/99
 
 64
 
 Now, area slight disagreement within Working Group
 describe view things going forward, will. remind you, current
 approach discussed vote today involves issuing statement effectively talks
 potential adjustments policy intermeeting period. think most, all,
 people group seemed feel probably good approach, though
 arguments perhaps it’s bad. within Working Group came two
 alternatives.
 One approach, I’d like focus conceptual level opposed
 wording, try get forward-looking elements much focused
 described balance risks. thinking behind concept market
 really needs know Committee’s concerns risks Committee sees
 looking intermeeting period without necessarily jumping
 policy implications.
 second approach fact proceed include
 reference policy implications. thought behind concept anything
 stop without addressing obvious question “so what?” policy
 implication issue speak directly. issues outlined pages 4 5
 memo.
 Now, perhaps long introduction, I’d like go around
 table usual fashion get reactions memo, since know read it.
 points consensus Working Group strong reason
 disagree, that’s fine, please indicate that. importantly, indicate whether
 general preference toward forward-looking elements announcements tied
 providing sense balance risks whether would prefer something similar
 current symmetry/asymmetry approach, addresses possible adjustments policy
 explicitly. issues Working Group needs guidance.
 Let mention one process issue. take guidance, obviously,
 go back try craft appropriate wording. draft language
 memo, don’t want discussion become heavily focused specific words
 used, since plenty time continue work wording. get
 
 11/16/99
 
 65
 
 guidance whether we’ve generally got consensus right
 would handle future-looking element, would helpful.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know think would useful?
 seven members Working Group?
 MR. FERGUSON. Yes, seven.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since you’ve thought this, might helpful
 hear individual members reasons came views did.
 MR. FERGUSON. think that’s absolutely fine. don’t start one
 closest me, Mike Kelley, we’ll go around table others.
 MR. KELLEY. would welcome opportunity review little
 language suggested Chairman’s latitude act meetings.
 problem substance it, would like work language bit more.
 Concerning wording announcement Roger referred end
 remarks, would strongly support alternative I--describing balance risks--because think
 it’s appropriately informative accurate. like fact avoids implying advance
 determination made Committee move one way other. not,
 fact, make determination. review situation zero base meeting.
 So, view, appears alternative appropriate presentation
 FOMC leaves meeting.
 MR. FERGUSON. Okay. Larry Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. particularly wedded language either options.
 strongly prefer spirit second option, focuses policy implications,
 reason. tilt about? market trying learn about?
 market say “You favorite forecasters want know view balance
 risks outlook think forecast”? market want glean
 information policy intentions?
 Now, leave say we’re going talk balance risks,
 say balance risks toward higher inflation means Fed likely
 tighten. There’s great damage that; I’m saying going infer that. can’t
 hide it. would want hide that? want hide that, shouldn’t get
 business tilt all. don’t want hide it, transparent
 
 11/16/99
 
 66
 
 say think balance risks result think it’s
 likely rates rising rather falling.
 next question is: really tie hands FOMC respect
 future? course not. wouldn’t want that. tying anybody’s hands. every
 meeting sit start scratch making assessment economy
 outlook. best job meeting. question whether also
 provide honest assessment leaning future. That’s doing,
 every time.
 market going focused policy decision next meeting
 talk terms policy leaning opposed talking balance risks?
 can’t understand why. we’re concerned that, don’t communicate?
 tell market don’t view tilt particular focus next meeting.
 saying prejudged going move that’s tilt-­
 decided time next time. tell market
 decision symmetry encompasses near-term horizon, typically perhaps period two
 three meetings.
 Another factor goes thinking believe it’s much difficult
 convey might want tighten whether might want tighten. lot
 nuances, lot different models, lot different perspectives around table.
 might difficulty--though probably minor thing--talking exactly
 balance risks we’re weighing. draft language memo
 two things drive policy time--the risks weighted either toward weakness
 economic activity toward higher inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. balanced.
 MR. MEYER. balanced. think that’s relatively minor point. didn’t
 like language focused likelihood particular policy move.
 perhaps little stronger language using. Instead saying
 future we’re likely tighten, simply say we’re likely raise rates
 lower rates. That’s much softer way conveying asymmetry opposed saying we’re
 likely raise rates hold constant.
 
 11/16/99
 
 67
 
 would preferred marry balance risks likely direction
 interest rates. I’d give simple statement balance risks say result
 likely rates rise rather fall risks balanced, equal
 likelihood rates rise fall. I’d go back language
 directive, precede sentence balance risks.
 MR. FERGUSON. Bill Poole.
 MR. POOLE. agree Larry. think focal point decisionmaking
 interest rate decision, federal funds rate decision. many different views
 one time converge particular decision, trying explain different
 nuances going helpful. However comes out, never viewed
 prediction forecast what’s going happen next meeting. fact
 may continue low predictive value seems irrelevant. high predictive
 value, could mean acted right away. shouldn’t want high predictive
 value. regard aim trying give sense direction. think really going
 easiest us reach consensus focus entirely sense direction
 respect policy instrument, federal funds rate.
 MR. FERGUSON. Mike Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. majority one. liked alternative I.
 problem alternative II, close today, phrase “possible
 need adjustment stance policy.” gives impression likely
 we’re going making adjustment policy--that going changing rates-­
 take step back talk balance risks. like balance risks
 approach better. appears less likely finger trigger we’re ready
 pull trigger make move next meeting. So, favor alternative I.
 MR. FERGUSON. Bob Parry.
 MR. PARRY. favored alternative II. [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. see, well-managed group!
 MR. PARRY. many reasons mentioned Larry
 Bill. saw alternative would consistent fewest additional sentences
 explanation, viewed great virtue. based experience today, see
 really big virtue aim. Moreover, seemed important point
 
 11/16/99

 focus clearly implications policy. think somewhat
 explicit that, time experience would good providing information.
 MR. FERGUSON. Ned Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. getting impression divisive
 group. would note start agree first nine points. [Laughter]
 point trouble, I’m majority. favor alternative I. think point
 keeping finger little farther trigger factor but, several people

 MR. FERGUSON. comfortable alternative well reasons
 Ned Gramlich articulated. think distinction talking potential

 and, therefore, policy reaction. experience we’ve suggests markets
 often, least occasionally, prone over-interpret are. would like give
 fewer words, will, and, Ned said, move finger little
 bit away trigger even though it’s completely away. think, Larry pointed
 out, movement away trigger helpful. ended preference
 alternative margin 4 3. say many people said could
 live alternative I. Again, regard Ned’s point group divided
 might seem, views weren’t held hard fast force individuals could
 never see moving another option. So, that’s were.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Could ask question?
 MR. FERGUSON. Yes.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I’m confused point fact. proposal
 that, finally decide words, three available statements, end
 
 11/16/99
 
 69
 
 meeting choose either use statement risks balanced

 MR. FERGUSON. think proposal table one three

 view future, intention working group one sentence would
 handle vast majority future statements. Now, one experience,
 think drove us bit. October meeting adopted asymmetry

 Group things closely balanced might need follow-up sentence,
 that’s always option. expectation would sentence would carry

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bill, I’m member Working Group

 Secondly, seems may expose Chairman political

 MR. FERGUSON. optimistic man! Cathy Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Actually, find agreement Al Broaddus
 points final one discussed now. think Working Group done us
 favor de-linking discussion symmetry implied authority Chairman
 change monetary policy FOMC meetings. understanding asymmetry
 phrase always interpreted two meanings. One gives Chairman
 latitude second conveys sense discussion balance
 risks meeting. seems unlinking two things obviously good thing
 do. making Chairman’s authority explicit, disagree Al. think it’s better
 explicit not. offers Committee opportunity object requires
 Committee consulted afterwards Chairman find feasible beforehand.
 opportunity annual review process--though can’t imagine ever
 coming that--to renew authorization not. seems lot better spelled
 rather degree confusion surrounding meaning symmetry asymmetry
 language seen experience sitting table. Often course
 comments policy Committee members would give different interpretations
 thought symmetry asymmetry phrase implied policy. think it’s better
 explicit give Committee opportunity say yes annual basis.
 wording, I’m drawn alternative less explicit possible
 policy adjustments. think Chairman good argument says go
 alternative II find necessary, can’t move back “I” start “II.”
 MR. FERGUSON. Ed Boehne, next.
 
 11/16/99
 
 73
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Roger. think colleagues
 Working Group really done quite extraordinary job move us far
 complimented. comments intended within overall framework.
 two alternatives, favor “I.” main reason finger ought
 little back trigger. Risks sometimes materialize sometimes don’t.
 add policy side assessment balance risks, we’re really making
 two-step statement whereas description balance risks makes one-step statement.
 easier go “I” “II” want reverse. come “I.”
 proposed wording paragraph 2 Authorization, shown near
 top page 4, think Chairman absolutely authority move
 meetings extraordinary circumstances. don’t think that’s debatable. world always
 predictable think Chairman simply authority. implicit
 directive. fact, got symmetry asymmetry language partially reason-­
 try fine-tune extent authority Chairman meetings.
 going make adjustment de-couple directive itself, agree
 Cathy clear expressly state it. concern
 precise wording. think ought Committee authorizing Chairman direct
 Federal Reserve Bank New York, etc., etc. don’t think ought delegating authority
 directly Federal Reserve Bank New York putting Chairman consultative
 position. agree basic premise Chairman authority;
 precise wording another issue.
 one comment, relates points consensus, don’t
 feel strongly it. Point two says FOMC’s vote every meeting encompass
 intended federal funds rate symmetry asymmetry. point three says
 operating paragraph longer would contain sentence referring Committee’s
 consensus symmetry asymmetry. read it, surface least, appears
 inconsistency. don’t feel strongly issue.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Roger, think President Boehne
 practicing law. seems ironic General Counsel would propose something different
 want know why.
 
 11/16/99
 
 74
 
 MR. FERGUSON. actually pointing General Counsel’s direction. think
 important everyone know language proposed Virgil Mattingly’s language.
 continue work it, think that’s appropriate.
 MR. BOEHNE. Virgil, known language, would
 questioned it. [Laughter] I’d still like hear explanation.
 MR. MATTINGLY. involved fact Committee

 MR. MATTINGLY. Working Group change draft wording say

 There’s almost sense encouraging Chairman review data intermeeting
