 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. objections except mine, [laughter]

 Next review System’s security lending program related
 proposal amend Committee’s Authorization Domestic Open Market
 Operations. Peter, would like review briefly involves?
 MR. FISHER. Yes, let mention points, may. Committee
 reviews Authorization Domestic Open Market Operations first meeting
 year. proposed amendment Authorization Committee
 consider. rather lengthy memo subject.
 points would like try cover again. think could done better job
 memo providing clearer contrast existing program proposed
 program. Let try briefly.
 current program lend securities one week.
 accordance rather low limits bills coupon securities described
 memo. charge flat fee 150 basis points, regardless security’s current
 value market, prohibition short selling. is,
 supposed lend dealers sold security short, even though
 virtually impossible us--and cases dealer--to determine
 accuracy.
 major change proposing instead charging flat fee, would
 hold auction minimum reserve fee 100 basis points. effect,
 dealers want security, provides allocation mechanism involves
 something first-come first-served, helter-skelter basis calls Desk
 first. auction also mechanism allows us waste public assets,
 speak. is, charge flat fee 150 basis points something worth
 
 2/2-3/99

 150 basis points “on special” Treasury financing market, giving
 away System property, will, accepting less income System could
 receive.
 second change proposing limit structure. Instead
 rather low limits, higher limits proposed, explained memo.
 important shift one-week term lending overnight lending. don’t
 think underscored quite enough memo important shift would be.
 previously described Committee concern change program
 simply move demand supply curves equally. would
 accomplish much. longer thought this, realized
 willingness dealers market participants short securities really based term
 financing. one shorts security plans finance series overnight
 borrowings. think terms one-week longer time periods
 trying finance short sales. demand supply shortening
 securities come from. limiting System’s lending overnight program
 transactions occur noon, rather late day, think would
 better job providing lending facility addresses clearing issues keeps
 market moving, without encouraging dealers short securities. trying stand
 apart short selling activities.
 25 percent limit suggested begin with, would actually
 lending less lending currently, rough-cut calculation. noted
 would clearly expect raise limit somewhat saw increased demand,
 certainly would without talking Committee. also indicated
 memo, hard imagine raising limit one auction anything higher
 50 percent total holdings issue.
 think proposed program changes enhancements better
 enable us achieve existing objectives. changes designed provide
 little grease clearing mechanism enable dealers avoid
 games go security scarce borrowing essentially
 cost failing cover. people may try cover shorts creates
 perversions.

 nature proposed program. designed it, still
 intended limited program. would happy answer questions
 said aspect memo circulated Committee.
 MR. BROADDUS. Peter, thank memorandum. detailed
 complete. sense, memorandum presents operational issue,
 seems proposal closely related broader issues manage
 portfolio along maturity curve operate forth.
 something sentiment old “bills only” controversy Committee
 around table many years ago. comment perhaps half observation
 half question. memo seems imply order run monetary policy effectively
 engage open market operations effectively, operate along curve
 including issues longer maturity. sure true. seems
 could run monetary policy entirely, needed to, operating short end

 situation, somebody going lose somebody going gain.
 don’t think much stretch think conceivably moral hazard issues
 might arise conduct lending operations regular basis. wanted throw
 ask thought broader issues addition
 detailed technical issues covered memorandum.
 MR. FISHER. certainly intent aspect program
 would suggest anything maturity structure portfolio; memo
 suggests that, want correct misimpression. fact, demand borrowing
 comes much bill sector coupon sector. So, really think proposal
 independent structure portfolio. could talk that,
 past, think proposal stands apart debate.
 
 2/2-3/99

 second point, tried establish set rules avoid
 using discretion. sure would characterize issue involving moral
 hazard problem. want set rules enable procedure operate every day
 without make discrete decisions affecting prices changing
 behavior. change program’s major features, big change
 would move overnight lending to, say, one-week lending. would imagine
 situation like Drexel crisis, would come back Committee
 propose change. would add probably rather bizarre,
 marginal, impact current prices giving away scarcity value securities
 whatever dealer happens call Desk first morning. So, lending
 program clearly impact price-setting process, think open auction
 feature new program result transparent less egregious impact

 MR. BROADDUS. think proposals memorandum

 asking basic question whether need engage activity all. According
 market analysts, market rather liquid deep. really need this?
 MR. FISHER. short end market currently deep, though

 MR. KOHN. think one could also argue entity holds huge

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. don’t objection proposed program, might
 understand better following explained: difference would see
 marketplace lending versus lending outlined

 MR. HOENIG. May add question? mentioned memo,
 Peter, time market crisis proved helpful past raise lending

 explained that.
 MR. FISHER. extreme, one worried about--I hope get

 President Hoenig asked whether could discreetly. Could

 thought long hard it, seemed pose moral hazard issue

 interject ourselves, would end intervening Treasury market
 manner similar intervening foreign exchange markets, trying pick level

 problems us. So, want impact margin, think better

 Now, spirit this, let clear. relates said.

 MR. BROADDUS. Yes, absolutely. raising broader question.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Peter? Would somebody
 like move Treasury securities lending authority requesting?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. move authority requested,
 Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection, ordered. next item

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Finally, get

 questions Don?
 MR. KOHN. would like clarify points, Mr. Chairman, may.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t go ahead.
 MR. KOHN. trying respond series issues arisen
 last couple years course investigations leaks confidential FOMC
 information conversations Committee members staff. proposal
 trying accomplish couple objectives. One make clear
 confidential information extends beyond physical even electronic documents
 people possess one learns FOMC meetings--the informational content
 meetings. intent define better confidential.
 Secondly, want facilitate policy discussions among staff Reserve
 Banks Board Committee members staff.
 recommend reclassifying Bluebook Class II give wider circulation
 clarifying Committee members Board Bank senior staff

 Class clearances. Conversations like occur. conversations would
 happened meeting, said what, would

 Thirdly, want protect confidentiality decisionmaking process

 Reserve Bank see documents 4 5--basically people
 authorized attend meetings. confusion
 document itself, try clear up. new program also avoids
 confusion apparently existed distinction currently Class

 documents taking Bluebook category. making Class

 people have.
 Finally, reading getting comments several people
 around room, recognize points still need clarified. weren’t
 clear could every case. would appreciate comments either

 comments, clean draft, get back Committee March cleaner
 draft says want say. don’t vote today, current
 program continue effect another seven weeks next meeting. So, it’s
 wouldn’t something effect. would recommendation, Mr.
 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seems reasonable. anybody
 objection that? Let’s then.
 MR. KOHN. people comments, I’d happy hear them.
 MR. BROADDUS. one quick comment. worry little

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. way general set rules
 then, certain conditions, temporary alterations rules endeavor

 President Broaddus.
 MR. KOHN. already rules, Mr. Chairman, authority
 make exceptions specific situations. think President Broaddus raising broader

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. trying say conceive

 comments, Don, assume plan away current arrangement

 longer include directive; smaller group would allowed read directive;
 even smaller group could discuss went recent meeting.
 MR. KOHN. think second distinction would go away. inclusion

 distinction Class directive access would go away. second
 investigation Inspector General pointed limited access directive

 set number people given access information policy

 eliminated.
 MS. MINEHAN. Let put request take one step back ask
 much sense makes. many people Banks get access
 policy alternatives part intimate group people
 advising President meeting? ask
 whether makes sense let advise President know
 went meeting? know rule limiting access directive existed
 lot us didn’t know it. questioning rule.
 MR. KOHN. Obviously, Committee whether wants give
 people access information goes meetings. Maybe that’s choice
 could give Committee next meeting: many people want
 access Class information? know risks sides. trying
 make distinction knowing went meeting sense
 issues arose staff work needed done versus knowing went

 Consumer spending remains healthy, boosted part robust activity housing

 New England. Labor markets tight, regional unemployment rate

 Consumer prices rose measurably faster Boston nation whole

 Finally, amid doom gloom reports U.S. agricultural industry,

 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. regional economy

 anecdotal reports suggest people expecting 1999 stronger year
 1998, may reflection strong autos, construction,
 sectors finished year. told backlog presold, not-yetbuilt houses record levels rising year-end. Construction employment
 year expected, construction trade unions anyway, exceed levels

 Overall, labor markets continue tight. One large regional

 first meeting year, look back forecasts last several

 It’s higher last year’s 2.4 percent. year 2.4 percent 1996
 think forecast first meeting year 1.8 percent fourquarter period. Growth substantially exceeded initial forecast last

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. sake variety let start saying
 everything great District. Agriculture hurting region elsewhere.
 dairy farmers, Cathy Minehan’s District, better others, overall
 agricultural sector weak. Currency depreciations number competing
 countries really hammered apparel manufacturers Carolinas,
 significant layoffs industry. So, holes region.
 But, large, District economy probably robust time
 remember career. Even manufacturing, apart agriculture

 Virginia Carolinas, doldrums long time,

 Elsewhere, consumer sentiment spending remain strong essentially
 across board. good holiday selling season, according anecdotal
 information anyway. lot speculative building Washington region,
 especially around Dulles Airport, several cities District, notably
 Charlotte. Labor markets remain tight except areas mentioned little earlier
 layoffs. State unemployment rates 4 percent four
 six jurisdictions. Generally, picture pretty strong.
 Let make comments national economy context Bank’s
 Humphrey-Hawkins forecast. asked submit forecast based

 usually that. [Laughter] case, projection would misinterpreted
 somebody thought statement think likely actual outcome
 economy year. So, little less ambiguous perhaps informative
 way proceed view would simply assume going
 change policy, done generating forecast year.
 turns out, course, assumption one underlying Greenbook
 projection, use different model derive ours, namely small six-equation
 VAR model. get broadly similar somewhat different results: real GDP
 growth projection 3 percent 2½ percent Greenbook;
 somewhat higher inflation rate 2½ percent. first glance, saying,
 numbers Greenbook look pretty good. 2½ percent CPI
 inflation rate projecting, obviously big improvement
 many years ago, still worries me. really main point want make today.
 Labor Department corrected ½ percentage point 1
 percentage point upward bias CPI usually associated Boskin
 Committee Report results. 2½ percent CPI projection equivalent unbiased
 projection 2 percent, personally believe upper bound
 tolerance range inflation going forward. seems good place
 draw line inflation, given now.
 regard, worth noting also core CPI rate increased 2.2 per
 cent 1997 2.6 percent 1998 consistently measured basis,
 inconsiderable move wrong direction. lower PCE inflation numbers certainly
 comforting degree, enjoyed discussion today.
 fact is--and related Cathy Minehan saying--the CPI still nation’s
 inflation standard. think it, measure inflation, drives people’s
 expectations perceptions aggregate inflation country. now, least
 changes, seems CPI focus on.
 
 2/2-3/99
 
 55
 
 would add two quick final points. First, last fall’s ¾ percentage point
 reduction funds rate done unsettled financial market conditions
 threatened restrain aggregate demand future, negative shock
 really materialize. sure implications captured
 model’s estimation hence forecast summarized. not,
 forecast may understate underestimate potential lagged stimulus could still
 coming months ahead last fall’s easing. could hit economy time
 already full stride. That, least, represents clear upside risk.
 Second, M2 growth last year overshot top target range 4 percentage
 points; correct, biggest overshoot substantial margin since late
 1970s maybe 1980. recognize problem due anomalous factors
 affecting money demand. keep mind money targeting procedure--and
 blast past--still allows base drift. last year’s overshoot
 ratified targeting procedure. big potential monetary impulse still
 move 1999, even able keep M2 growth within whatever
 target range set 1999. So, bottom line, think balance risks outlook
 shifted back upside.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. could say District economy well

 regional economy Philadelphia District remains strong and, anything,

 Looking ahead, business people feel confident outlook 1999,

 MR. BOEHNE. really question, even though might sound like

 NAIRU couldn’t 4 3½ percent? one goes back, example, 1960s

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Chart 3 price stability simulation, Chart 4

 result--converging ¾ percentage point less inflation per year baseline--is
 desired? get Chart 4, presumably would federal funds rate

 MR. KOHN. Right. Chart 3 difference 2 percentage points

 MR. POOLE. Chart 4 built assumption satisfied

 NAIRU lower, we’re satisfied

 add Chart 4 discussion implications policy Chart 4.
 MR. KOHN. Right. Looking back Chart 3, would tighten

 MR. PRELL. simple rule-of-thumb exercise using model 100 basis

 MR. KOHN. Right, that’s lower NAIRU scenario.

 MR. MEYER. think inflation process inflation

 excess demand, moves us dangerous territory monetary policy.

 would cautious prematurely burying concept.

 also surprised hear many people believe special factors--the
 appreciation dollar, health care cost developments, forth, feel
 important recent episode--have immaterial views
 inflation. Declines oil prices $26 $12 per barrel seem quite relevant
 understanding recent inflation experience. So, think keep balance
 this.
 Even productivity growth moved upward, know trend
 know unemployment rate declining. come back story

 still means economy growing trend,
 considerable prospect continue put discipline

 problem believe initial conditions already

 around trend growth, tells asymmetric directive. Growth
 little lower trend would call easing monetary policy, growth
 trend would call tightening monetary policy.
 Mr. Chairman, certainly accept recommendation wait little longer
 asymmetry story. hope concerns reflected

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, happy support recommendation
