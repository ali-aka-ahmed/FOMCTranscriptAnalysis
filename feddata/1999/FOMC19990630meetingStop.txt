 really question whether equity market equilibrium today. equity
 market isn’t equilibrium today, moves back equilibrium brings
 change saving rate. what’s going on?
 MR. KOHN. think it’s part phenomenon. wealth-to-income
 ratio declines couple reasons. One equity prices don’t rise rapidly

 know, modest increases thereafter equity wealth-to-income ratio.
 it’s it’s behavior stock market, it’s fact

 people saving enough current income. We, residents United
 States, buying enough wealth that’s created keep wealth-toincome ratio falling current saving rate. think happens

 also brings current income permanent income. things work
 together raise current saving income. So, flattening stock market,
 leveling growth rate permanent income, catch-up growth rate

 basically leveling growth productivity. think one could look

 Main Street we’re satisfied 25 basis points, things would begin

 recommendation let explain why. view question
 raise fed funds rate. failure would create extraordinarily strong reaction
 markets; think first trade would I’m quite sure second
 trade would people would wonder Federal Reserve policy

 issue really becomes question announcement tilt. agree
 fully--and mentioned yesterday--that financial markets simply

 question is: go establishing would describe

 also agree absolutely certain increase funds

 addition fact would difficult manage, two

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First all, let thank
 extremely provocative remarks. look forward working digesting
 soon transcript available us. much prosaic level, let say
 initially strongly support recommendation. think two sets
 reasons cautious moving aggressively right now. first revolves
 around uncertainties today’s economic situation, regard would make
 couple points. economy could slow spontaneously. fact,
 second quarter relative first quarter. look consumption include
 housing consumption item, represents 70 percent GDP. throw
 capital expenditures, it’s well 80 percent. think number reasons
 great many components could easily grow slowly. Even
 
 6/29-30/99
 
 92
 
 remain high level, rates growth could substantially lower.
 haven’t done far doesn’t necessarily mean can’t won’t.
 Secondly, partly referred to, Mr. Chairman, trends
 recent past could easily extend long time. Extremely strong productivity may
 well long life ahead it. Inflation may stay quiescent been.
 economies rest world stay somewhat sluggish implicitly
 thinking, may happen; would strong impact.
 Lastly, stock market precarious position. It’s
 fragile think shock prone. Investors take chances, concern
 stock market developments could strong impact real economy.
 Another factor play here--and harkens back remarks, Mr.
 Chairman, dialogue Kohn minutes ago--is dynamic
 may set place new policy releasing Committee’s views much
 freely. think first venture announcement tilt May really
 went quite well. markets seemed understand quite accurately accept
 was. interpreted fairly well. Markets moved.

 think, serious misinterpretation overreaction part public.
 avoid that, Committee judicious cautious bill

 events possibly creating substantial unpredictable mischief. Let’s
 remember, course, tighten time feel it’s necessary;

 it, many times, symmetric directive. indicate
 announcement release afternoon. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greenbook forecast,
 far either consensus forecast own, suggests able
 stabilize inflation acceptable rate without multiple tightening moves. Given risk
 higher inflation, 50 basis point tightening year incorporated
 Greenbook forecast would view prudent appropriate. would mean
 25 basis points today another 25 basis points later year, subject
 condition data interim disconfirm need second move. believe
 risks moving direction, given strength economy today,
 initial conditions terms labor market tightness, ability reverse course
 necessary. is, hand, considerable risk nothing.
 another example maximin strategy: Consider worst outcomes various
 policy alternatives select policy least bad outcome. Mr. Chairman,
 talked possibility productivity still accelerating, might
 case. is, expect also means equilibrium real interest rate rising well;
 case seems little damage done modest
 increase interest rates.
 want spend time talking policy rules issue
 operate uncertainty measurement output gap. papers
 prepared meeting were, think, provocative interesting deserve
 comments.
 policy prescription simple Taylor rule would yield
 aggressive near-term tightening one suggested. similar trajectory
 time Greenbook extended forecast. policy called Taylor
 rule would fall two phases. first phase would I’d call reassessment
 releveling phase. is, rule would call immediately reversing least
 easings last fall return prescribed path target funds rate. second
 phase would response changes unemployment rate inflation rate

 6/29-30/99
 
 94
 
 Now, Orphanides et al. work uncertainty output gap suggests
 attenuating, though eliminating, response funds rate changes
 output gap. suggests, therefore, partial return level-based Taylor rule
 prescription, would yield “phase two” increase funds rate response
 higher inflation. conclusion papers policymakers downweight
 response changes output gap face uncertainty
 measurement intuitive sensible. difference,
 emphasized papers, downweighting response output gap
 ignoring output gap altogether. difference uncertainty total

 papers highlight effectively importance flexibility using

 forecast. Sometimes may confidence implement level-based rules;
 sometimes may want cautious along lines change rules. Whether
 we’re prepared aggressive cautious responding changes
 output gap may also depend upon initial conditions, particular relative

 Applying nonlinear rule today’s decisions would imply returning toward,

 staff papers I’ve read long time, think it’s useful many respects. Apart
 particular policy conclusions suggests, think could make even broader

 real time data series see Taylor rule would work those.
 Finally, I’d like point deficiency Taylor rule see it; think
 fundamentally one identified Orphanides paper. rule
 suggests need move real funds rate away fixed constant, given
 historical average, fact output gap inflation gap arises. Larry
 Meyer suggested earlier, even gaps zero, macroeconomic developments
 make necessary real short rates move us follow accommodate
 rate changes. example, one Larry cited earlier--and I’ve made point
 previous meetings--is increase trend productivity growth means real
 short rates need rise. repeat, reason households businesses would
 want borrow perception higher future income order increase
 current consumption investment it’s actually available. rate needs
 rise induce consumers business defer spending fact output
 available. Taylor rule doesn’t give attention kind real business cycle
 reason move rates. allows reaction inflation gaps output gaps.
 bottom line, really enjoyed reading paper think

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. certainly agree move today appropriate.
 far strength action way it’s interpreted, I’d prefer
 without discount rate increases. Since believe stronger action
 appropriate, hope Board consider issue discount rate behalf
 directors anyway.
 Unlike Al Broaddus, though, I’m going disagree issue symmetry.

 MR. BROADDUS. might buy that!

 MR. JORDAN. happy state affairs one collective view

 behavior without asymmetry words. Last fall, opinion
 Committee shifted toward view risks downside, moved

 Committee risks fact balanced. think symmetric

 far announcement symmetry/asymmetry, think Professor Eisenberg

 something nature rather foolish thing do; comes back haunt us.

 That’s doesn’t elicit behavior marketplace would occur

 Imagine absurdity announce afternoon Committee
 voted today raise funds rate ¼ point next meeting August 24 and,
 therefore, plan save airfare travel time show
 we’ve already decided going that. Well, that’s rather absurd.
 think announcing something interpreted market meaning
 already decided raise rates next meeting, think May announcement
 interpreted, gets us undesirable position. tell already don’t want

 changing rapidly downward direction, would prefer enter environment

 get position we’re comfortable risks symmetric soon can.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. think need raise funds rate 25 basis points today.
 seems largely boxed rhetoric ought get

 reasonable economic rationale this, given uncertainty we’re
 facing, “take-back” rationale last fall, financial markets

 several years, 25 may fine. If, hand, become less confident

 situations.
 tilt, think ought go back symmetric directive today.
 need calm things down. need shift public’s emphasis away
 psychoanalyzing Committee back economy; view symmetric
 directive would help that. Announcing tilt, least initial experiment,
 turned cruder instrument think anticipated, largely
 interaction rhetoric. point don’t know enough say much,
 if, raise rates further, therefore shouldn’t box

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation 25 basis point
 increase. would favor asymmetry think correctly reflects
 
 6/29-30/99
 
 103
 
 believe risks outlook policy. would symmetry
 fear first that, itself, doesn’t correctly reflect assessment risks.
 Secondly, also concerned would misinterpreted market. Obviously
 statement accompanying symmetry could clarify things indicate risks
 really symmetrical. going go route, even Jerry Jordan’s
 recommendation becomes attractive me. really begin wonder whether
 referring symmetry accomplishes anything.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support
 recommendation 25 basis point tightening stage. period
 uncertainty weigh data little heavily forecast. think
 data support small move. forecast, 50 basis point increase built in,
 perhaps indicative need move, it’s mandatory today based
 know. think also evidence high wealth-toincome ratio also larger share imports GDP may

 sitting seat meetings ago.
 question tilt, slight preference maintaining
 asymmetric tilt. I’m concerned raise rates go symmetry put
 somewhat hawkish message saying we’re still leaning direction, create
 rather less tendency psychoanalyze 17 18 us thinking.
 Frankly, ideal world would decision, tilt announcement,
 complete silence Committee. going get there, think
 least ought continue process trying help markets understand tilts
 mean. I’m concerned creating another tool form well
 crafted legal/economic document give market something else chew over.
 obviously strong point view, go symmetry well-crafted

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. came
 meeting wanting least discussion 50 basis point increase, got that,
 appreciate much. helpful. Along lines listening you,
 assessment shaded terms issue--the issue degree
 durability productivity improvements we’re trying decipher. So, would go
 25 basis points. move up, think appropriate. represents
 continuation gradualist approach built pretty high degree
 credibility time, served us well.
 Given that, would strongly support symmetric directive
 meeting. believe represents consensus FOMC don’t think
 anticipating next move one two things happens--either get new
 information addresses earlier issues raised, group
 change judgment. either occurs, change rate
 intermeeting period next meeting. think right approach terms
 dealing market information share.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation ¼ point
 tightening. thoughts symmetry mirror Bob Parry’s closely views
 Larry Meyer Al Broaddus expressed earlier. judge sentiment around table,
 certainly own, judgment one 25 basis point tightening probably
 enough deal likely coming. still think probability
 needing tighten fairly high. intellectually honest
 credible go ahead tell people that, rather try back
 symmetric directive.
 also afraid moving back symmetry mutes policy move makes
 timid. two-year-old granddaughter finishes eating says “all done”
 cute hand signal say she’s finished. afraid financial
 markets lenders, builders, others get sense saw need tighten
 tiny threat quit helping us trying lean see
 coming. Also, me, moving back symmetry suggests we’re smart enough
 
 6/29-30/99
 
 105
 
 make one small ¼ point tightening move fine-tune precision don’t think
 have.
 Finally, I’m concerned, despite reminders frequently made
 policy move symmetry, view tell markets “so it”
 decide need move. created new device symmetry/
 asymmetry announcement, think created--either intentionally unintentionally
 --an expectation try hard, perhaps harder past, let people
 know headed. concerned even though data may begin
 nudge us direction additional tightening, may want cycle back
 move asymmetric directive tightening move later. would push
 move later year necessary and--as Larry Meyer reminded us
 said last meeting--will get us period suspect prefer
 meddling markets Y2K situation play. would least
 modest preference asymmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation 25 basis point
 increase federal funds rate. think issue symmetry complicated
 fact language directive refers explicitly intermeeting period.
 sentiment around table seems may may need increase
 intermeeting period next meeting; think that’s way markets going
 interpret symmetry. sentiment around table that, likely not,
 going need increases later year, perhaps next meeting
 sometime later. think problem getting box precise
 wording symmetry clause. it’s confined strictly intermeeting period
 make clear say, seems symmetrical directive
 probably appropriate. don’t think want give firm signal rather
 confident need increase rates next meeting. judgment,
 reading people said around table, confident that.
 would much defer desires want craft directive language

 there’s convincing case CPI 1½ percent year going yield

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, favor ¼ point increase
 fed funds rate. think it’s appropriate economically markets prepared it.
 far question symmetry concerned, issue usually am,
 deep-seated, built-in bias toward symmetry. So, feel way
 time. preference simply assess incoming information act action
 appropriate. want accompany semi-hawkish language
 view prospects, that’s fine me. must admit I’m sure
 market take statement.
 seems it’s shorthand say market simply trying
 psychoanalyze Fed guess what’s going happen next. Another way saying
 that, along lines Bill Poole talked about, they’re looking
 information we’re looking they’re trying piece together understand
 means prospective economic performance, monetary policy actions, on.
 Maybe effort become intense. even that’s true, won’t
 first time lot intensity effort.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. don’t know can’t know horizon.
 Inflation may verge accelerating may be. Certainly strong case
 made is. similarly strong case could made time last
 year time year before. tried enforce speed limit based
 contemporaneous estimates NAIRU last years, would likely
 today inflation 2 percent unemployment near 4 percent. I’d hate
 see us lose nerve point risk bringing experiment premature end.
 I’d rather continue test growth limits new economy unmodified.
 modest tightening, hope accompanied return neutral

 [Laughter] shorter version thing: reasons

 described eloquently ago, would prefer keep foot brake
 continue test limits new economy described. comments led
 believe Committee boxed in, would recommended
 meeting change fed funds rate. Therefore, get box,
 adopt unbiased directive meeting and, Ed Boehne put it, calm things down.
 Longer term may want revisit earlier suggestion stop voting

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. comments
 longer term. First, impressed discussion board
 meeting Chicago Detroit directors gave presentations
 electronic commerce. little differently. divided board ahead time
 groups banking, services, retail, manufacturing--we done background
 paper ahead time well--and organized presentations
 themselves. Many lot work preparing think
 presentations really enlightening. came away discussion,
 things read heard talking people this, feeling
 something profound clearly happening electronic commerce impact
 firms. don’t know significant terms impact economy. It’s
 area learning we’re going continue learn coming
 months years. look forward studying detail helpful
 comments meeting.
 decision today, certainly agree 25 basis point increase.
 tilt, think it’s close call. thought earlier discussion Kohn
 comments, Mr. Chairman, helpful. think somewhere
 full tilt symmetry point. balance, come back point mentioned
 before: credibility--or specifically, credibility--is extremely important
 point it’s extremely high, too. So, would defer question.
 preference would asymmetry. current circumstances think 25 basis
 points tilt misinterpreted unless accompanied strong statement
 
 6/29-30/99
 
 111
 
 strong language testimony. Even then, still may misinterpreted
 “that’s it,” believe Jack Guynn said. So, prefer asymmetric directive
 defer this.
 question tilt itself, think clearly learning
 know use new tool effectively. quote you, Mr. Chairman,
 one area we’re engaged “on-the-job training.” It’s new tool we’re
 new environment. tightened symmetrical directives,
 new. recall mentioning meeting several years ago back 1994
 planning start series tightening moves, great deal difficulty
 signaling intention market time. Clearly, there’s difficulty today
 type signaling. We’ve said going transparent tool.
 go symmetry, view less transparent. That’s personal
 view. mind questions usefulness tilt itself. listening
 discussion around table today, it’s clear wide differences
 among members Committee exactly tilt means. keep
 tool place, think using lot less before, predicted last
 year discussed this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think conversation around room making
 us Jordanian been. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. thought time
 needed take back least portion, all, ease monetary policy
 enacted last fall face chaotic financial markets. Certainly, prospects
 external growth, fact yet seen rise inflation,
 temporary factors keeping bay unwinding give even
 cause think unwind easing monetary policy. question
 today whether tighten much tighten. know there’s great
 deal uncertainty accept point research subject,
 uncertain slowly move, taking time assess
 things. strikes me, others said, rather intuitive.
 Now, Greenbook forecast suggest least 50 75 basis
 points tightening needed year keep lid inflation 2000. Keeping
 
 6/29-30/99
 
 112
 
 lid inflation thereafter require much more, longer-run analyses suggest.
 It’s true analyses done traditional way, using traditional constructs
 models, subject lot uncertainty. incorporate
 estimates output gap; incorporate revision trend productivity;
 also incorporate assumptions NAIRU. people would debate validity
 structure. Certainly, continue accelerating productivity growth,
 estimates output gap NAIRU forth may wrong. time
 uncertainty, certainly seems relying constructs helped us bring
 nearly 20 years better economic conditions--milder cyclical turns, ever lower inflation,
 lower unemployment, sustained growth--has validity. seems appropriate
 look back things helped us create kind environment President
 McDonough referred to, one people working, people
 experience working, benefits growth shared fully all. think
 argument really turns whether want environment continue. want
 continue way extends experience 20 years, need
 careful containing inflation following constructs helped us get
 are.
 So, assuming monetary policy forward-looking even time
 uncertainty, need tighten policy now. agree proposal 25 basis
 points. next question say it. Based analysis
 Greenbook forecast forecast, think likely need more.
 regard, favor keeping asymmetric directive. Jack Guynn outlined
 many reasons think asymmetry makes sense time.
 wonder whether we’re seeing terms market reaction
 we’ve said tilt much reaction change we’ve introduced
 announcing tilt anything else. time, market participants get used
 announcing moving moving next meeting, wonder
 reactions going calm considerably; perhaps get used market
 get used well. view one reasons decided

 members Committee. regard, premium honesty. order
 
 6/29-30/99

 honest feel course future actions be, directive
 asymmetric.
 Finally, reiterate another point believe Jack Guynn mentioned, 25 basis
 points, tilt, hawkish language, suggested, may well create
 bigger market reaction comes out. uncertainty
 we’re using language. Frankly, without asymmetric tilt, think we’re likely
 see market get ahead itself--experience somewhat euphoric increase, thinking
 engaged kind tightening believe people think
 necessary.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. read Committee, we’re
 strongly support 25 basis point increase modestly support symmetry.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. drafts number different
 announcements concerning decision, I’ll read one think closely
 reflects Committee’s views:
 Federal Open Market Committee today voted raise
 target federal funds rate 25 basis points 5 percent. Last fall
 Committee reduced interest rates counter significant seizingup financial markets United States. Since much
 financial strain eased, foreign economies firmed,
 economic activity United States moved forward brisk
 pace. Accordingly, full degree adjustment judged longer
 necessary.
 Labor markets continued tighten recent quarters,
 strengthening productivity growth contained inflationary
 pressures
 .
 Owing uncertain resolution balance conflicting
 forces economy going forward, FOMC chosen adopt
 directive includes predilection near-term policy action.
 Committee, nonetheless, recognizes current dynamic
 environment must especially alert emergence, potential
 emergence, inflationary forces could undermine economic
 growth.
 wording satisfactory?
 MR. BOEHNE. think that’s good.
 SEVERAL. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay.
