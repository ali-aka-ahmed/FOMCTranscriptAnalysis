 Seventh District economy continues expand moderate pace. However,

 Conditions ag sector generally remain depressed, results recent survey

 sector performing well may picking steam. evidence, Purchasing
 Managers’ Surveys Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee indicate expansion
 overall manufacturing activity picked past three months. Motor vehicle
 producers continue experience strong sales. April sales light vehicles

 increases apparent year two ago. sea change, Mike Prell

 One former directors large trucking operation noted firm

 building new stores, including land, risen 50 percent last three years.
 Last time noted prices paid component Chicago Purchasing Managers’

 culprit, 11 21 commodity prices surveyed 50

 regional pricing news leaves quite sensitive data contained
 Friday’s CPI report. Al Broaddus mentioned, course, make
 much single month’s data, though increases appear broadly based. fact,
 biggest concern remains inflation year, rather acceleration core
 inflation expected next year, perhaps higher level forecasted before.
 addition, incoming data remained strong since last meeting raised
 forecast real GDP growth year next; productivity growth remains
 rapid past quarters, projected real growth would
 sustainable. if, somewhat pessimistic staff keeps telling me, trend productivity
 growth picked much Greenbook asserts, could face substantial
 increase inflation end next year. Thus, think risks become tilted
 decidedly upside, think time come reevaluate policy stance.

 Turning national scene, obviously data revealed stronger- thanexpected economy again, causing us revise real GDP forecast upward.
 contour forecast changed much, however. still expect
