 MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. benefit

 perhaps characterize U.S. economy continuing hit “nothin’

 readings wages prices even benign

 won’t get new era program simply extrapolate good
 news--rather predicting, again, economy decelerate
 appreciably inflation pick up. I’ll brief, emphasizing
 key points Greenbook.
 basic thesis still domestic demand growth slow
 enough next several quarters offset lessening drag
 external sector. two key elements story
 familiar--indeed, danger becoming quite shopworn.
 first stocks consumer durables, houses, business
 equipment already growing rapidly that, absent deceleration,
 they’ll get way whack longer-term income output trends.
 second element share prices continue rising anything
 approaching pace past several years, they’ll get way whack
 profit trends. course, interaction two
 elements--a virtuous cycle point, one carry far
 basis unrealistic expectations.
 So, recent signals whether verge
 moderation? Frankly, face it, aren’t many signs
 slowing far household business investment concerned. Real
 expenditures consumer durables appear headed 12
 percent annualized gain first quarter; residential investment appears
 
 3/30/99

 headed 12 percent gain; business equipment outlays
 appear headed for--you guessed it--about 12 percent gain.
 But, let try put little spin numbers. case
 business equipment spending, guess first-quarter growth rate
 considerably 17 percent increase last year, recent
 orders data indicators suggest moderation ahead.
 Meanwhile, consumer durables residential investment, one
 point special factors boosted activity late might

 One intense competition among automakers sparked

 money light trucks probably afford continue
 competition time, seems unlikely would escalate
 pricing battle enough push sales recent elevated pace-­
 especially given capacity constraints. likely, demand
 already pulled forward incentive programs, sales fall
 spring.
 Another special factor mortgage-refinancing wave,
 receding. Pinning effects refinancings spending hasn’t
 proven easy thing do, intuition, anecdote, statistical
 work suggest demand received extra boost refinancings
 stimulated lower interest rates last fall.
 Finally, run-up housing starts recent months likely
 reflected efforts builders satisfy backlog orders
 built surge demand last year--efforts aided mild winter.
 Going forward, tight supplies construction workers could make
 difficult achieve, late, normal seasonal
 pickup activity. builders may even want try, given recent
 hints peaking demand homes. Consequently, projecting

 MS. MINEHAN. Mike, introduction comments implied
 
 forecast reflect way belief “new economy.”
 last three four years seen trend rate productivity growth first go
 less 1 percent--say, 0.7 0.9 percent--and double
 now. Two questions: believer “new economy,” high would
 number be? [Laughter] second, fact productivity growth little
 stable seeing really cyclical, sensitive
 timing inflation increase forecast? Could inflation actually rise ½
 percentage point later year?
 MR. PRELL. I’m sorry, I’m sure caught last part question.
 thinking answering first part lost thread last part.
 MS. MINEHAN. Sorry. second part question is:
 take trend productivity number slightly less one now--let’s
 say 1.7 percent--how sensitive inflation forecast terms timing?
 inflation ½ percentage point something like end 2000.

 factor, think, high credibility low inflation strategy. supports

 understandably, East Asian crisis would significant negative effect
 U.S. economy. certainly negative effects. also
 powerful offsetting effects form big capital inflow helped hold U.S.
 interest rates way helped hold domestic demand up. end

 premature conclusion going forward. regard, mentioned earlier,
 Greenbook projecting significant deterioration net exports year,
 portrayed lot forecasters significant drag U.S.
 growth. Greenbook, deterioration projected accompanied
 modestly stronger dollar which, course, would help keep inflation check.
 think alternative scenario, probably closer John Makin’s point view,

 fortuitous capital inflow United States experienced last year,
 dollar declines. think ample historical precedent scenario.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. preparing today’s

 respect happened, economy date obviously gives little
 evidence domestic demand-driven slowdown. Personal consumption business
 investment spending quite robust. suppose surprising given
 strength employment relative ease access credit consumers

 Moreover, contagion Brazil continues quite mild respect

 “Cats” who, case solved, there. Inflation seems disappeared,

 Therefore, given constellation incoming data uncertainty

 main quibble staff forecast relates upward revision
 estimate trend productivity growth. revision, though small, lowers
 staff inflation forecast perhaps much ¼ percentage point end 2000.
 result, little pessimistic staff inflation outlook 2000
 beyond. key inflation forecast initial conditions--the
 tight labor markets--would make difficult avoid significant increase
 inflation without adjustment policy, even economy slow trend
 immediately.
 put perspective implications initial conditions staff
 forecast, let pose following question: well take advantage
 extraordinary disinflationary forces expansion, given staff forecast
 slightly pessimistic scenario, order lower underlying inflation trend going

 forward? Another way asking question is: degree current
 episode example opportunistic disinflation? Inflation measured core CPI
 3.1 percent 1995 coincidence favorable inflation developments
 impacted economy. much lower inflation expansion
 point help extraordinary disinflationary forces clearly
 important?
 Let’s take staff forecast first. put inflation methodologically
 consistent basis, add 0.6 percentage point estimate 2.5 percent core
 inflation rate year 2000. staff’s forecast says lowered
 underlying inflation rate all. get conclusion use GDP chain
 measure inflation. course, inflation rising end forecast period,
 infer expansion inflation actually increased despite
 extraordinary disinflationary forces work.

 driving outcome? Blessed combination positive supply shocks
