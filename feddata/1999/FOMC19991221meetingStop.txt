 MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 put Greenbook seasonal nutshell, suppose
 would say we’ve brought tidings great joy, maybe great
 comfort.
 broad macro terms, economy performing splendidly.
 Though can’t especially confident point, looks real
 GDP growth current quarter close 5 percent, annual
 rate. so, 1999 would fourth year running growth 4 percent
 more. job gains still strong, we’ve enjoyed three straight
 years average unemployment rates 5 percent. chain index
 GDP prices increased less 2 percent four consecutive
 years.
 Moreover, outlook described baseline forecast almost
 good. GDP growth projected fall little short 4 percent
 mark next two years. unemployment rate expected
 remain near 4 percent GDP price increases 2 percent.
 among upbeat forecasts U.S. economy you’ll find
 today.
 So, we’re right, basis joy pretty clear. You’ve entered

 side story comes in. believe economy may getting
 seriously overheated ways significantly distorted.
 Committee has, course, announced focus mounting
 pressures labor market likely potential source
 deteriorating inflation performance thus cyclical instability. But,
 though there’s near consensus among employers qualified workers
 terribly scarce, official data actually show decelerating wages. I’ll
 make three quick comments dissonance.
 First, continue think wage deceleration year owes
 considerably downside surprise price inflation occurred last
 year oil prices plummeted; view, year’s pickup prices

 certain--compensation form stock stock options. latter
 point underscored stream stories people passing big

 changes price pressures--never especially tight predictable one
 --has become even problematic.
 Given vagaries wage picture interpretation,
 thought proof inflation pudding might eating,
 perhaps simply ask whether there’s evidence prices
 beginning accelerate. would say
 evidence, though may yet compelling.
 Certainly, we’ve seen upturn core PPI crude intermediate
 goods prices. time, helping explain acceleration

 And, course, I’ve noted repeatedly, overall consumer prices

 households’ short-term inflation expectations appear risen

 me, though well might work: markets might say FOMC symmetric,

 however small, market would say FOMC unbiased Y2K and,
 didn’t tell us anything expectations future, maybe

 MR. KOHN. think either approach likely work: symmetry, we’re really
 asymmetric next meeting; asymmetry, we’re really symmetric next
 meeting. It’s question weighing, you’ll pardon expression, balance risks-­
 [laughter]--not respect economy respect market reaction.
 trying point think risk, perhaps small risk, initial headline
 “Fed goes asymmetric” rather “Fed goes asymmetric number

 perfect way this. risk side headline “Fed goes

 question best represents intend clearest way get
 across. thing bothers little asymmetry words
 directive literally say “over intermeeting period,” announcement would literally
 say “but don’t mean it.”
 MR. MEYER. There’s nothing new there! [Laughter]
 MR. KOHN. think either way would work, least hope so. Either way would

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like refer memo
 sent Committee dated December 17, 1999. Let start simply reviewing state
 play, will.
 last meeting principal issues discussed related whether
 wanted two things: (1) change directive language used describe
 Committee’s assessment prospective developments; (2) define precisely
 Chairman’s latitude making intermeeting move. first point, issue
 whether wanted move toward language balance risks describe
 Committee’s view future move away call “symmetry/asymmetry”
 today. consensus, though objecting points view, want
 make move. sent Working Group back consider language
 detailed way, revised language memo starting page 5. one
 point need discuss further.
 second thing asked Working Group consider best
 express Chairman’s latitude intermeeting move. took look language
 suggested made slight adjustments. page 5, section B.
 third question emerged, involving couple recommendations Cathy
 Minehan handle directive wording. page 6. fourth issue
 emerged proceeded expectation would form public
 announcement change January. latter two pages memo describe
 would go announcement, though draft.
 Let also remind November meeting looked nine areas
 strong consensus within Working Group, got sense
 change agreed then. state play.
 Now, would like follows: Though general consensus emerged
 FOMC clear majority Working Group wanted move
 toward language focuses balance risks tied
 legislative goals, people still clearly felt needed make sure
 comfortable decision. first I’d like ask President Poole give

 because, pleasant experience was, don’t look forward repeating next
 year! [Laughter] So, careful thought important here. Then, would like call
 members Working Group give perspectives issue. Also,
 go around others, I’d like hear thoughts balance-of-risks language
 elements memo, including language intermeeting moves,
 Cathy Minehan’s proposals directive language, communicate
 publicly. hope reasonably clear. Bill Poole, let turn you; see Bill
 handed memo.
 MR. POOLE. think enough copies go around you’ll keep passing
 on. wanted put thoughts paper allows state things
 concisely. Working Group’s proposal balance-of-risks language,
 calling Option 1, slightly modified since last discussed it. major
 concern last part involving statement Committee
 views future economic conditions, want focus on. Let go
 points.
 First, think going much easier us agree possible policy action
 statement concerning possible future economic conditions. Second, believe
 Option 1 language implicit Phillips curve analytic framework behind
 view every member Committee comfortable framework. Third,
 think many market view Option 1 language essentially code
 existing tilt language--that, fact, read Committee view future policy.
 important us allow perceptions develop we’re talking code.
 Another issue, point four, would talking economic conditions rather
 future policy action. truly talking economic conditions, take
 Committee vote matter--a statement forecast, will. So, think
 markets tend view language economic conditions really code future
 policy.
 Furthermore, concerned way general public may
 interpret language. think inviting headlines say “Fed sees economic
 weakness ahead” vote directive says see possible economic weakness.
 don’t think going helpful us.
 
 12/21/99
 
 61
 
 I’m also concerned language Option 1 analytical weakness.
 successful preemptive, changing economic conditions see lead
 us take policy action end day create either economic weakness
 inflation. That’s whole idea we’re trying get across: see possibility
 economic conditions that, offset policy action, would generate economic weakness
 inflation. want preempt changes economy don’t want occur.
 So, think language proposed Option 2 really accurate. change
 economic conditions see developing going generate policy action not,
 fact, generate economic weakness inflation.
 Lastly, think majority Working Group overreacted market’s
 response announcement May. explicitly told market would
 disclose tilt Committee wished “to communicate public major shift
 views balance risks likely direction future policy.”
 surprising market reacted first used device said
 would announce tilt something major say. fact, since May, think
 market understood using device much routine basis.
 view responses since May used asymmetric directive
 helpful reflected overreaction.
 So, seven reasons strong preference I’m calling
 Option 2. must say wish straight mind 10 12 weeks ago

 view one mild preference I’m calling Option 2 Option 1.
 I’ve thought it, become concerned Option 1 approach.

 it’s wise desirable Committee confer authority. Obviously, always

 seems gains something like this, either explicitly

 Finally, practical level, today’s technology--we’ve talking

 MR. FERGUSON. I’m terribly comfortable speculating that.
 MR. JORDAN. raise rates take balance risks toward
