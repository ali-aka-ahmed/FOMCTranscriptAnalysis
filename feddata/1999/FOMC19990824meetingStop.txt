 economy gradually return trend growth rates. However, moderation growth

 Meanwhile, factors driving recent rapid expansion demand--high

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s recess coffee.
 [Coffee break]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District economy expanded solid
 pace far year, although disparity across states increased. District payrolls
 expanded 2.4 percent rate first seven months year, 3.1
 percent pace 1998. Employment growth rates fastest growing states--Arizona,
 California, Nevada Utah--averaged 2.5 4.2 percent. five District
 states--Alaska, Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington--employment expanded
 national pace. Despite slower overall growth, District labor markets remain tight.
 Construction services well transportation, communication, public utilities
 continued strongest sectors District’s economy.
 contrast, District manufacturing payrolls declined 1.6 percent pace
 year. Employment reductions occurred durable nondurable sectors.
 durable sector reductions broad-based, although employment declined

 District’s production bulk commodities experiencing largest price declines.
 Turning national economy, 1995 1998 core price inflation measures,
 even consistently measured bases, generally trending downward. decline
 probably reflected favorable supply shocks outweighed strong demand.
 However, several special factors helped well. Since mid-1998 disinflation

 out. halt progress toward goal price stability sounds cautionary note

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, lot change District
 since last meeting. jump bottom line, one exception I’ll mention
 minute, see relatively signs deceleration activity region. last
 meeting, reported consumer spending especially robust May June,

 really outlier. exception, don’t see many signs slowing overall
 activity regional level.
 don’t see many signs national level either. Greenbook points
 widening U.S. current account deficit could produce sizable depreciation dollar,
 potentially inflationary implications. think it’s also possible major
 trading partners could ease monetary policies going forward prevent currencies
 appreciating, could stimulate foreign growth perhaps even beyond
 anticipated. Either developments could increase U.S. net exports least
 moderate rate decline, potentially inflationary consequences given already
 tight labor market conditions United States.
 seems weight risk national outlook still skewed
 upside. time, would certainly acknowledge downside risks,
 specifically possibility sharp decline stock market might scare consumers
 precipitate sudden collapse confidence spending. Obviously, cannot rule
 sharp market correction. even one occurs, reasons thinking
 current situation negative impact event demand
 
 8/24/99

 employment could contained. I’ll mention couple points. First, back 1987
 think saw learned react quickly appropriately contain
 downside impact market break. Also, talking wealth effects
 worth keeping mind physical capital constitutes 30 percent aggregate wealth
 United States human capital constitutes 70 percent. monetary policy
 keeps job market track, think workers still reasonable confidence
 longer-term income prospects, would moderate negative effects spending
 might otherwise come market break.
 Finally, situation bit less precarious precisely Fed
 credibility expected, think quite generally markets, take actions
 needed contain inflation. that, course year least, bond rates
 rising well ahead actual policy actions, preparing market additional
 restraint sense creating continuity--maybe smoothness would better word--of
 monetary policy. think reduce likelihood really sharp market break,
 though doesn’t eliminate it.
 bottom line, Mr. Chairman, downside risks outlook,
 point seem still pretty clearly outweighed upside risks
 potentially costly inflationary implications upside risks.

 One element nobody discussed--I’m sure important could

 indeed case operating domestic profit margins rose second quarter--we
 don’t official data yet evidence points increase, judging
 individual company reports see--certain algebraic conclusions follow. Algebraically
 stable price level rising operating profit margins necessitate decline rate
 change unit costs. Since labor costs 70 percent unit costs indications
 nonlabor cost area suggest modest declines, necessarily follows rate
 increase unit labor costs declined second quarter. indeed precisely
 shows income side evaluation costs prices. I’ve indicated
 previously, look nonfarm business sector income side, estimate
 last four quarters unit costs rose less ½ percent. Unit labor costs
 ¾ percent. growth rate income, course, also significantly stronger

 grant lots arguments statistical discrepancy

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, fully support

 reason domestic economy certainly bear it. worst case scenario

 Another reason--which alluded to, earlier remarks--is

 new economy marred burden interest rate increases based
 demand side considerations without equal consideration given supply side factors.
 productivity growth rate 1.3 percent, even lower, second quarter--a
 period rapid growth hours worked--after averaged almost 4 percent previous
 two quarters. expect see higher productivity growth trend show labor
 supply growth slows. guess true productivity growth trend turn
 much closer 3 percent 1 percent. Wages may fact rise even faster
 unit labor costs may rise, years profit boom years investment
 boom raised capacity faster output, seems higher wages
 appropriate. taught wage-push inflation occur higher wages
 alone without validation monetary expansion. never know
 appropriate rate monetary expansion is, heartening money growth
 decelerated recent months. would prefer rate increase meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. agree recommendation raise funds rate 25 basis

 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. support “C” symmetric, truly symmetric. I’ve never studied
 statistical discrepancy don’t want get question whether ought

 talk makes less worried inflation, hope
 you’re right. [Laughter]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. favor aspects recommendation, Mr. Chairman--that is,
 increase federal funds rate objective symmetric directive. would add

 I’d personally like see progress toward price stability. I, too, would prefer raise

 would prefer symmetric directive part don’t know fast aggregate
 supply continue grow also agree much President Poole

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation rate
 increase, strongly support symmetric directive. say fact
 make ¼ percentage point move, sit back analyze effects, analyze data,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation increase

 issues raised here. looking information
 giving full weight comment probably going move least one
 time, given way operating, sense asymmetrical tilt

 others using tilt directive, certainly understand arguments.
 slightly different perspective this. see it, current operating
 procedures monetary policy works large extent influencing yield curve.
 One important determinants channels influence market expectations
 regarding future policy actions. key point expectations always
 there. sense one could say always market perception tilt one
 direction another tilt, whether use tilt language directive not--and
 do, whether announce not. key issue need keep mind.
 given that, issue see inevitable market perception tilt
 absence tilt gets determined. don’t use symmetric asymmetric language
 directive all--or don’t announce it--then expectations would formed
 largely, think obviously appropriately, Chairman’s public statements.

 One quick final point: mind, asymmetric directive statement

 FOMC action, never interpreted promise. So, going
 use anything like future, need make clear.

 “we’re done” type action. really first choice, though. first choice

 thought increase 25 basis points rates like idea catch-up,
 I’d favor 25 basis points funds rate 50 basis points discount rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. consensus “C” symmetric, 25 basis
