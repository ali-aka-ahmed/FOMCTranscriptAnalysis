 mr. ferguson. tom hoenig.
 mr. hoenig. i’m quit sure sai, roger. start out, i’ve thought
 commun last month, think earlier releas minut
 would provid us opportun cut back statement. indic earlier
 memo us cut back statement, even coupl earlier releas
 minut, would view step back term inform provid. caus
 think forecast submit twice year prepar semiannu report
 monetari polici focu commun outlook. i’d rather
 forecast provid congress report—along relev committe

 minut—be vehicl us put rang view rather risk statement,
 dissatisfi effort commun market
 whomev els. so, sinc we’ve open door option choos here,
 would sai realli would like pare back press releas. i’d try provid sooner
 rather later greater sens varieti valuabl view among committe member
 differ come ultim lead consensu. that’s two cent
 worth.
 mr. ferguson. okai. bob mcteer list last time,
 ned gramlich, bob parri, bill pool. think still dilemma
 last month end discuss 2:00 p.m.
 mr. mcteer. agre cathi statement shorter simpler—
 much so. i’ve long argu, don’t think favor start
 announc bia vote. would recommend bia vote. don’t it,
 we’re nontranspar releas it. it’s fairli obviou wai polici ought
 go meet, think ought go rather noth promis,
 bia vote, like next time. whenev act, peopl outsid
 know pretti much inform do; don’t realli need much
 explan vote wai did. think leav much
 flexibl announc fewer move part, fewer wai make
 mistak leav bia. requir releas minut earlier, fine.
 that’s right me. don’t think even that. i’d sai we’ve found
 recent lengthi press releas announc variou bias serv us
 well prefer go back old system.

 115 133
 
 mr. ferguson. ned gramlich.
 mr. gramlich. i’ll try quick. term write rel formula
 statement move part, know tri last time, happen
 sort difficulti aris. peopl ask, go problem?
 go problem? don’t want clear issu issu.
 statement get complic murkier. so, frankli, don’t think kind
 statement go work.
 second point group think minut panacea. it’s
 separ issu. might get sooner, even do, we’re still go
 issu statement dai meet. world go want bottom line, either
 give it, somebodi els give it. i’d propos, roger suggest,
 treat separ issu deal post-meet statement best can.
 third, mai attract altern option materi roger pass
 out. exactli todai—to issu short statement everi meet. vote
 go forward. happen situat face checker tailor
 differ it’s hard design formula move part work everi
 meet. want give statement, reflect think. that’s type
 statement agre todai—a short statement describ think go
 economi. that, would sai statement short—no
 seven eight sentenc. person would recommend compulsori halfhour period read draft statement think it. shouldn’t rush ram
 through. actual try someth democrat talk it. result
 longer meet, that’s right me. don’t toler meet

 think have. set interest rate influenc
 throughout world economi. mai take us anoth two hour that.
 mr. ferguson. bob parri.
 mr. parri. roger, cathi refer three option lot move
 part. think differ. number move part number thing
 agre differ. on propos languag we’ve actual us year
 never problem with—or least few. agre don’t want
 lot move part, think three option regard.
 seem look three altern.
 mr. ferguson. sai, judgment call, obvious, nineteen
 differ judg. bill, what’s view?
 mr. pool. i’d like see propos that’s pretti close a—i’ll call prime—
 would focu reason polici decis meet would minim
 amount forward-look element. judg risk roughli balanc,
 leav feder fund rate alon. judg risk becom unbalanc
 particular direct, either rais fund rate lower it, risk assess would
 explan took action did. that’s point number on—that think
 could recast along line.
 second, would urg stress-test take actual situat face
 meet of, let’s sai, last five year determin would done regard
 statement meet. mai scenario would want stress
 test addit that. would like see histori rerun, will, see
 statement would look like septemb 1998 whatev propos.
 
 decemb 9, 2003
 
 117 133
 
 mr. ferguson. well, guess i’m go last word
 minut left. here’s i’ve note. heard rang view three option,
 don’t think heard anyon sai let’s stress-test them. mai ultim sai it’s
 complic let’s go new type statement, didn’t hear anyon sai “pleas
 stop process now.” think need continu process, perhap broaden
 stress test littl, make sure pick rang situat know occur
 last five year. i’m sure everi meet on recal
 seri meet inflat look pick seri
 meet look though inflat fall off. long cover wide
 rang circumst, think respond issu rais stress test.
 second thing heard clearli keep tabl two option
 aren’t specif set materi. on simpli cut back press statement
 altogeth minim forward-look aspect it. we’ll includ clearli
 option discuss, there’s stress test that—or littl
 work group regard option.
 i’d sai thing respect focu minut releas earli.
 that’s clearli someth peopl want talk about. leav enough time
 two-dai meet cover that, though it’s slightli independ aspect
 commun polici. alreadi plan discuss expedit minut and,
 said, think requir input board staff think market mai react,
 pro con take step, et cetera. two issu—what
 statement minut—do interact littl. michel warn us time,
 appear step back transpar statement give someth els
 
 decemb 9, 2003

 stead, make differ public reaction. two decis
 interrel degre. sens share bob mcteer’s frustrat bia
 statement—had never vote tilt we’d never disclos it—our problem
 we’ve vote tilt mani year. elimin would lead great market
 constern. so, cours, can’t wind tape back whenev committe
 decid first vote tilt.
 three thing hear. fourth that, ned gramlich said, sens
 length meet relev factor thi. don’t know right answer
 that. would sai it’s certainli someth go consid. ned
 right, think degre is—we’re set interest rate least world’s largest
 complex economi world—the attempt nineteen peopl
 three hour mai manag. mai longer stage
 that. mai decid we’re longer set rate we’re talk economi
 set implic polici futur. we’re set rate, we’re try figur
 best explain it, we’re look forward. that’s lot nineteen peopl
 three hour.
 mr. mcteer. think that’s red her. don’t think anybodi room would
 argu that, choos on option, short meet. there’s argument
 that.
 mr. ferguson. no, i’m suggest on thing mai come
 januari meet gener consensu need start meet littl earlier. don’t
 know. i’m sai that’s part discuss we’re go have. i’m
 put option trade thing.

 119 133
 
 ms. minehan. but, roger, think it’s import recogn us
 favor shorter, simpler statement, length meet noth whatsoev
 prefer. spend ten hour argu polici, i’d happi that.
 mr. ferguson. well, fact it’s 2:00 p.m. [laughter] try filibust
 that. no, sai two issu interchang. mai decid want
 differ length meet independ decid statement.
 issu bubbl decid. now, chairman mai agreement.
 chairman greenspan. let indic good congression
 tradit clock stop 2:00 p.m.
 mr. ferguson. it’s proce.
 chairman greenspan. well, unless somebodi formid import
 issu rais point, meet adjourn.
 end meet
