 first item agenda minutes. usually boilerplate, somebody said
 last night, isn’t morning. discuss proposed addition minutes,
 relates special session last evening. call upon President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, regard first sentence proposed addition,
 seems past we’ve referred objectives fostering economic growth
 price stability long term. would make sense stay language refers
 objectives long term.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know objectives sustainable long-term

 MR. PARRY. No. don’t think that’s meant past we’ve used
 language. think knew couldn’t achieve objectives every instance,
 set long-term objectives.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, maybe I’m splitting hairs. objective
 nature something one seeks. We’re always seeking long-term sustainable growth.
 MR. REINHART. Mr. Chairman, “long-term” could moved end
 sentence.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s I’m trying get at. I’m nitpicker.
 MR. PARRY. No, that’s fine.
 MR. POOLE. There’s language Bluebook page 10 we’ve used long
 time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, could wrong! [Laughter]
 MR. POOLE. There’s something said consistency.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. virtue consistently wrong?
 MR. POOLE. language Bluebook page 10 “directive wording”
 actually broken two parts. second sentence starts “To long-run objectives,”
 refers objectives specified first sentence.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I’m going appoint committee relook
 two sentences! [Laughter] anyone disagree said?
 MR. GRAMLICH. Well, proposing put economic growth price stability

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think ongoing, unchangeable objective seek

 MR. GRAMLICH. Right, think you’re proposing “a fostering sustainable
 economic growth price stability long run,” President Poole points
 language we’ve used now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s standard. know exactly want

 MR. BERNANKE. “fostering” used sense trying create

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. substantive point objective

 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 MR. KOHN. could complicate things reading Federal Reserve Act.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, admit problem wording

 MR. FERGUSON. May raise hand lieu President Minehan?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, want raising hand?
 MR. FERGUSON. know I’m helpful—and agree can’t edit

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There’s also another consideration. Suppose conclude

 “Nonetheless, members recognize going forward could consider changes might

 seem absolutely fine me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seem adequate you?
 MR. MOSKOW. Say again.
 MR. FERGUSON. Michelle, would read it?
 MS. SMITH. Okay. “Nonetheless, members recognize going forward could

 MS. SMITH. “May”?

 kind time frame think might working here?
 MR. STOCKTON. think you’re absolutely right one biggest differences
 forecast consensus forecast optimistic outlook aggregate
 supply. number you, fact, remarked optimistic forecast is. really
 don’t view optimistic gap large diminishes slowly.
 Now, could wrong that. we’re wrong, productivity assumption doesn’t

 necessarily mean wrong significantly output gap going forward, too.
 could well that, we’re wrong underlying productivity, we’ll see faster

 less potential income expectations going forward. honest, think risks
 reasonably balanced around productivity forecast. must say statistical filtering

 MS. MINEHAN. anybody watched economy last several
 decades, it’s hard say forecast 5 percent GDP growth one side

 MR. STOCKTON. Obviously, first possibility could wrong.

 I’m also concerned CEO confidence improving, it’s taking strongly. Though

 Nevertheless, expect seeing increase employment, Greenbook

 Let speak briefly inflation outlook. expect core inflation remain

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. key question meeting
 whether incoming data real economy, market developments, ultimately
 outlook sufficiently changed last meeting warrant change either policy
 tactics. I’ll discuss turn but—not mysterious—have concluded
 midcourse correction seems called meeting.
 First, data, one sees signs economic acceleration indeed
 widespread probably firmer last meeting, important exceptions.
 Households continue basis expansion. Sales consumer durables retail
 sales control category consistent growing economy. important
 many thought household sector might eventually falter. regard,
 take note conversation Dave Stockton Chairman respect questions
 
 September 16, 2003
 
 63 106
 
 impact recent tax cuts. given basic strength economy, also
 believe we’re likely see increases income sufficient support
 expansion going forward.
 However, important question when, all, handoff take place
 households business sector. would say stage household sector
 still bulwark, businesses may initial stages picking portion
 burden. Orders shipments capital goods firmed, anecdotal reports surveys
 become bit upbeat. However, thus far participation businesses
 turnaround uneven. Anecdotal evidence suggests we’re seeing replacement
 investment yet expansion. Similarly, business investment inventories yet pick
 up, one hard pressed, think, support notion drag inventories due
 improvements supply chain management permanent lowering desired
 inventory–sales ratio. believe businesses still face lingering uncertainty sales
 seems weighing decisions respect rebuilding inventories.
 Finally, already much discussed, labor market conditions clearly consistent
 kind well-established firming activity economy experienced
 traditionally. course, issue regard labor market conditions may likely
 firm slowly environment improved structural productivity past may
 necessarily prologue.
 data indicate ongoing still uneven firming, take
 financial markets? conclude financial markets certainly supportive continued
 rapid expansion U.S. economy. Several indicators—including bond issuance, flows
 mutual funds, risk spreads, pricing credit default swaps, valuations high-tech
 
 September 16, 2003

 stocks—indicate risk appetites increased somewhat. Additionally, much-discussed
 backup long rates seem limiting factor turnaround. Indeed, think
 really signal expectation turnaround. However, absence truly robust
 expansion plans part businesses clearly seen relatively lax demand C&I
 loans. commentary banking sector contacts FAC members indicates that,
 most, bankers expect demand replacement investment expansion yet.
 data real economy, therefore, think financial markets painting picture
 improving still uneven economic backdrop outlook.
 Finally, let turn outlook itself. strong quibbles baseline
 forecast. However, note—as President Broaddus Q&A session staff
 report—that since previous Greenbook staff marked real GDP growth
 forecast period also marking unemployment rate next five quarters.
 time, they’ve left inflation rate basically unchanged actually slightly.
 clearly reflection fact taken productivity surprise
 structural productivity increases. also note, however, output gap remains important

 major quibbles staff forecast per se, must say see
 risks sides respect growth outlook. First, think others
 mentioned, there’s fact staff’s forecast seems somewhat Blue Chip

 least weight views optimistic individuals. I’d also observe
 might downside risks around staff’s current forecast. First, fear

 long employment lag, can’t fully rest easy. Lagging employment could threaten
 sustainability consumption, though many point out, argument debatable.
 think less debatable implied output gaps could also pull inflation

 There’s optimistic pessimistic explanation unusual behavior

 said today, lag reflects huge burst productivity, benefit

 potentially pessimistic explanation featured recently J.P.Morgan

 offer little jobless recovery recent years—and recession
 seems broadly like recent one—the downturn 1990-91.
 interesting initially employment inflation followed similar patterns
 1991 2001. recessions lasted eight months according NBER. Employment kept
 falling trough recessions whereas labor productivity rose sharply. earlier
 case, twelve-month growth nonfarm payroll employment hit minimum value, minus
 1.5 percent, May 1991, two months NBER trough date. recent episode,
 employment growth hit minimum value February 2002—also minus 1.5 percent—three
 rather two months trough date. cases also, core inflation virtually flat
 recession itself.
 closely parallel evolutions 1990-91 2001 episodes ended, however,
 shortly recession troughs. particular, rebound employment growth much
 stronger earlier episode. 1990-91, employment growth stabilized eleven months
 trough date; eighteen months trough, employment growth reached
 1 percent annualized. contrast, eighteen months trough current episode,
 employment growth still negative. three years 1991 trough, March 1994,
 employment growth 3 percent annual rate. short, 1990-91 2001 episodes

 MR. GRAMLICH. I’m 0 27 suggesting changes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s true. single last time!
 MR. GRAMLICH. I’m 1 27. last sentence, don’t think need word
 “considerable.” think sentence could written simply something like this: “In

 MR. GRAMLICH. still like sentence better, see point. I’m going
 make big issue that.
 MR. STERN. One 28!
 MS. MINEHAN. who’s counting?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Let continue usual tradition commenting first
 three-part recommendation I’ll talk statement. First, think you’re right
 shouldn’t move funds rate. always influenced chart shows
 current funds rate versus real equilibrium rate, think financial conditions actually
 rather accommodative. Also, change funds rate would surprise markets. don’t
 think move rate. respect balance risks, support
 recommendation stay pretty much tri-partite statement. view worked
 well. added another component recommendation press statement, want
 focus next. think important, Vincent suggested also implied,
 move chronological time economic time going drive policy
 decisions passage months see happening.
 get question want see happen. Obviously, seems right
 talk terms containing disinflationary forces. key economic issue
 worries us, issue continue focus on. rather like addition
 concept fostering containment disinflationary forces. son’s seventh grade
 English teacher probably would ecstatically happy resulting sentence,
 he’s room. like you’ve proposed gives sense ongoing
 process, think give us flexibility start see things coming together.

 is, feel succeeded fostering containment disinflation, might
 time make policy move, decide point reached.
 necessarily beautiful English, good description
 responsible Committee might think changing policy. That’s really want try
 signal time. So, light view nineteen people can’t redraft press statement
 readily sense want move chronological toward economic time
 statement, support three parts tripartite recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. I’m obviously agreement recommendation funds
 rate. Actually, don’t see alternative keeping language risks—the risks
 sustainable economic growth, risks inflation, balance risks—the last
 time. enough changed. Growth clearly little stronger, labor market
 constraints. think would difficult change wording, even though brings mind
 last night’s discussion none language particularly satisfactory right now.
 Nevertheless, don’t see case changing time, one basic points
 last night. last sentence draft ungainly; there’s question it. follow
 logic approach way, meeting two, back away prescribing
 time period move toward mentioning set circumstances—or however want
 characterize it—that would affect future policy course. think sentence probably
 good way that. I’m agreement three parts recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. certainly support recommendation
 keep funds rate is. Let try get wording issue discuss
 
 September 16, 2003
 
 84 106
 
 view substance. First, want talk probability distribution rather
 word “risk” moment. inflation rate view probabilities
 going forward roughly symmetric around average inflation experience last six
 twelve months. believe situation different spring
 noticeable pickup activity. growth, think distribution roughly symmetric
 around consensus forecast. also believe growth modestly consensus
 forecast desirable sustainable. don’t think would cause us problems;
 view economy room run faster rate. don’t regard upside surprise—
 provided it’s outsized surprise—as risk sustainability economic advance.
 agree it’s important try rock boat attempt evolve
 language. preference would work going slightly different direction.
 Given view probabilities, would go balanced risks inflation
 price stability outlook view probabilities less balanced. believe
 that, going forward, risks price stability sides relatively muted. last
 sentence, would say something along lines “maintain accommodative policy
 considerable period expect risks price stability remain muted.”
 makes accommodative policy conditional maintenance low risks price stability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May make suggestion? know, that’s bad
 phraseology statement two meetings now. That’s going. don’t
 think gain much moving direction soon. fact, I’m sure probably
 lose something. keep phraseology mind. That’s bad way say mean.
 MR. POOLE. won’t destroy notes usually meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, given strength economy see, least
 basis recent data, support leaving funds rate 1 percent. However, even
 expected pickup growth, there’s uncomfortably high risk inflation may move
 lower would desirable. Certainly Greenbook, revision productivity, it’s
 clear gap probably greater today thought case past.
 favor retaining current risk assessments, risks balanced growth
 weighted toward downside inflation. want make parenthetic point.

 made easing. particular, one two scenarios seemed indicate easing might
 appropriate something insurance policy—and one can’t see cost.
 would suggest that, indeed perceptible lull economy, ought jump

 MR. KOHN. Right.
 MR. MOSKOW. Right, that’s thought said. I’m saying
 would leave sentence last time; would preference point. think

 would like make comment remarks pace globalization

 hope protectionist sentiments subside. Second, breakdown

 way—and that’s developing countries playing larger role time.
 event, global talks always difficult. view ’05 deadline

 meet ’05 deadline, would counter experience previous global

 fits personal view, don’t know matches sentiment I’ve heard around
 table. broadly, new wording another ad hoc change, that’s going get

 bottom line sooner later, others said, we’re going take
