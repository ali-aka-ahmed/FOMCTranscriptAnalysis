 tempering policy response current readings output inflation. Indeed,
 suggested expectations future inflation—and, particular, inflation

 Finally, page 5, highlight two questions sense two sides
 coin. first question is, think analyzing

 modeling recent Fed behavior? second question is, extent actual
 Fed behavior conform models optimal monetary policy? Let start
 first question. modeling Fed’s decisionmaking process, argue
 Taylor rule incomplete description Fed behavior. However, adding partial
 adjustment policy rule solution; instead, opinion, partial
 adjustment adds another layer misspecification substitutes clearer
 understanding policy process. course, research required

 closely related question focuses modeling underlying motives

 Currently, policymaker “perfect foresight” path Bluebook uses loss

 (1) unemployment rate 1 percentage point natural rate; (2) inflation

 constructed optimal policy path match recent historical path funds

 behavior become aggressive changing funds rate? analysis
 suggests Fed sluggish reacting economic
 developments: likely set funds rate equal desired rate quarter.
 However, questions remain whether desired rate react
 forcefully economic news. Indeed, researchers typically find parameters
 optimal Taylor rule—that is, α β shown page 2—are much larger
 estimated parameters historical Taylor rule. Thus models, even
 trying take account various types uncertainty, recommend much
 vigorous policy responses. raises question, monetary policy

 convinced models capture important factors influencing policy.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Let carry conversation turn little.
 compare optimal rule estimated rule, optimal rule much aggressive.

 That’s guess even amount persistence we’re talking estimated

 Now, that’s case, seems critical dimension designing rule

 we’re trying produce rational expectations equilibrium market comes

 That’s because—this guess now—it much easier private sector

 MR. RUDEBUSCH. think reversals perhaps bit shorter run. Again,
 important point regarding optimal monetary policy way economists usually construct
 it’s quarterly frequency; use quarterly average rates. So, it’s one meeting

 reversals reflected up-and-down pattern meeting meeting. We’re talking
 quarterly average rates. Therefore, point view economic analysis, long

 kind policy changes think conceivable. live world rate

 different world one change could much larger, perhaps 200 300 basis

 MR. SACK. Another point that, aggressive rules would create

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, I’d like ask two questions first paper.

 MR. PARRY. Okay. There’s another point I’d like ask about. First all,

 MR. PARRY. seems little counterintuitive.
 MR. TETLOW. Well, let give one particular example. Suppose two
 models differed degree persistence inflation—your Bank’s random walk model

 shock it, inflation dies quickly. design optimal policy model inflation

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. discussion gone awhile, let
 make points. One I’d remind Brian Sack people sat around table
 October 1979 made argument made—that policy induced volatility

 MR. FERGUSON. Okay, good enough. Thank you. two points.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. couple comments. Starting
 point think Brian made, there’s difference inertia timidity.
 far inertia concerned, find Glenn’s story pretty convincing. that’s interests
 particularly. hand, papers seem least allow possibility that,
 relative sort optimal rule, Committee timid. best
 knowledge, way, reaction function literature going back 1970s
 maybe even seems come conclusion Fed overly timid.
 intuition rather suspicious conclusion reasons people already
 mentioned. Perhaps important one mind that, Taylor rule useful
 approximation, think it’s misspecification omits lot important variables.
 all, actions conditioned things think financial markets
 might react also forecasts sorts variables going picked
 Taylor rule. said that, would admit would feel better
 empirical work brought variables play demonstrated got
 reasonable results. far know don’t that. So, that’s issues.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 
 January 28-29, 2003
 
 47 195
 
 MR. SANTOMERO. First let congratulate Vincent David bringing
 table interesting issue worthwhile discussion. take two things away
 this. first English language funny thing. titles value laden,
 accept times easily, think. I’m taken phrase “optimal rule.” is,
 it’s optimal assuming everyone backward-looking optimal one might think
 perfect modeling sense. “Optimized rule” like better. slight spin
 phrase actually says optimized rule based upon model isn’t necessarily
 optimal formation expectations. true “policy perfect foresight,”
 usually shorten “perfect foresight” equation. isn’t perfect foresight. It’s
 policymaker’s perfect foresight economic agents using perfect foresight,
 therefore construction perfect. It’s perfectly rational even mostly
 rational.
 reason say play games either FRB/US English
 language recognize tend get game here. We’re trying
 defend something called optimal rule. seems close
 therefore shed inertia we’re “there.” fact, “there” may something
 artifact title gave it, therefore little cautious getting
 “there.” subject inertia gradualism timidity? like really
 comes point another value phrase wouldn’t want timid. might want
 gradual, might even want subject inertia, wouldn’t
 want timid. [Laughter] reason raise way reality we’re dealing
 world seem observe act slowly. rationale acting slowly
 actually put table. We’re sure data adjustments.
 
 January 28-29, 2003
 
 48 195
 
 We’re sure exactly potency actions coefficient uncertainty.
 Indeed, we’re little concerned markets’ reaction fragility
 issues. world, it’s surprising would act slowly. fact world
 think see it, may hold steady make move; not, reverse
 action. move closer, world backs rationale action artifact
 data, go far backwards.
 think fact policy behavior symptomatic environment
 uncertainty give credit for. view, actual behavior looks like
 rational response uncertain world dimensions laid out. rather try
 chase optimal rule, suppose reaction we’re probably better job
 optimal rule suggests. data markets seem support notion, Glenn reported.
 would comments.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. thought interesting

 think situations case. short, garnering benefits inertial
 behavior conflict need times act preemptively. Now, one level
 exactly late-breaking news, view it’s appropriate think along lines I’ve
 described.
 Let quickly try illustrate one particular example, that’s reaction
 Russian default fall 1998. One way interpret event subsequent events
 follows. reduced funds rate, recall, 75 basis points three steps 1998.
 markets believed target changes highly persistent seldom quickly
 reversed—certainly attitude then—the 75 basis point change carried longer-term
 rates it. reversed three easings 1999, fairly gradually.
 first change July; another one August another November. Now,
 go back look history, economy really rather strong early 1999, case
 could made reverse course much sooner. didn’t that, left
 reputation inertial policy intact. think one could argue reputation
 helpful cut rates sharply 2001 fight recession then, earlier, cuts
 seen lasting rather temporary. retrospect one ask whether 1999
 might one times reversed course promptly

 taking position. don’t know answer choice would best. I’m
 using case illustration kinds tradeoffs confront relative issue

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That’s you’re prudent—also known risk

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. There’s lot communication markets intended
 fed funds rate itself. One things find striking Committee and, course,
 particularly Chairman really remarkably clear coherent whole variety
 things it’s possible clear coherent. enjoys talking obfuscation,
 that’s fact markets time take away says. believe
 that’s important point. It’s one thing separates success here, think,
 problems central banks predictability we’re talking
 central banks. literature that.
 Let mention something find interesting. Roger talked fact fed
 funds futures market day meeting time right. One things
 Bob Rasche done go back try figure happens. one
 looks particular fed funds contract beginning trading—let’s say starts
 become active three four months advance—that forecast far advance often
 accurate. happens follow day day see information

 consequence new data weak report industrial production employment

 Committee. coherent picture policy process works obtained

 It’s also consequence way Committee—and emphasize particularly
 Chairman—has articulated doing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, it’s late intended comments would repeat
 others said, I’ll fairly brief. One point would note along lines Vice
 Chairman McDonough’s comment modeling human behavior. two models here,
 us probably agree dimension model depending
 circumstances. look models circumstances, find thoughts go
 Chairman’s earlier point Kohn’s. confident enough
 do, act boldly. less confident, act either cautiously

 models trying pick behavior. Since involves human behavior
 small group, we’re going get rather contradictory conflicting outcomes. That’s
 exactly we’ve got here, think, interesting. I’m interested signing
 psychological test, though! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Let make couple different comments. Also time,
 going repeat comments others made. One things found
 interesting reading papers Glenn’s chart page 2, looked different
 rules actual fed funds rate. strikes largest variances among
 different fed funds rates really occur mostly either turn noise
 data. private sector many events occurring, tell
 read situation—and picks Bill Poole said. FOMC
 
 January 28-29, 2003

 great track record persistent—when know we’re trying get
 recessionary period we’re really fighting inflation, whatever direction is—the market
 expects us persevere. keep along paths communication rate
 changes public comments make. views sometimes differ
 around fringes getting consensus turns happen, views Street differ
 well. extent that’s noise, think that’s different issue persistence
 policy course cycle.
 comment relates reacting overreacting. market tends
 overact. chairman early asset liability management committee (ALCO),
 group called fed funds rate administered rate saw always lagging
 behind whatever else going markets. advent derivatives
 hedging instruments, one thing bank ALCO managers hedge
 anything fed funds rate. That’s correlation low compared
 free-moving rates like Libor Treasury yields market indexes moved
 quickly. periods we’re talking about—for example, 1998—some us remember
 traditional hedges actually reversed us; instead negatively correlated,
 positively correlated. fact Fed signaling knew something
 unusual happening caused movements helped view damp overreaction
 marketplace. another element wanting overreact reverse
 fear would build market’s tendency overreact reverse itself.
 think it’s important us persistent, signal unusual events happening,
 communicate well. lessons take away papers.

 whatever reason, leadership providing clear view way would like

 So, question Karen, relates going South America

 pay debts couple years, Uruguay declare default now. might
 add econometric models used Fund analysis conditions probably
 would make United States look potentially bankrupt. Put two cases together. One
 country everything wrong rewarded IMF saying we’ll roll debt.
 poor little country tries everything right—and like rest us isn’t perfect—and
 IMF decides allow pay debts but, effect, requires default.
 Let’s move slightly north Lula da Silva’s Brazil. international community
 saying one nation it’s okay don’t pay debts—and another try like
 devil pay debts aren’t quite perfect, default—why Brazil jump
 hoops pay debts? figure out. question this: anybody

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. sad part it’s exaggerated factual.
 MS. JOHNSON. Yes. Let put one additional fact table try give

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you. Circling back lofty questions, relatively

 one looks chart 3 I’ll call debt burden ratio consumer payments, nearly

 pick up, expectation interest rates increase, migration
 heavier debt burden—depending circumstances, course, including income growth

 MR. SLIFMAN. Well, simplest answer empirically we’ve never actually

 MR. SLIFMAN. I’ll start, others join in. First, let make brief comment
 forecast versus many outsiders. It’s hard know exactly, think one
 main differences forecast many outside forecasts—especially we’re
 talking 2004—is productivity assumption. clearly stronger assumption
 feeds variety ways.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 MR. SLIFMAN. Let go couple issues raised try

 don’t know say terms upside downside risks.
 Now, let briefly comment state local government situation, may.
 clearly possible source restraint forecast, built fiscal restraint
 forecast state local sector. We’ve built lowering growth state

 local government spending levels seeing 1990s—the last time
 went difficulties—and making adjustments tax side well revenue
 streams. we’ve actually put dose fiscal restraint sector, recognizing exactly
 problems you’ve highlighted. think Dave Stockton comments wanted
 make well.
 MR. STOCKTON. Actually, fiscal policy side, see risks
 upside downside. We’ve built less stimulus Democrats proposed
 less Administration proposed. forecast correct, economy

 considerable possibility could get significant dose fiscal stimulus. think
 upside risks associated that.
 structural productivity issue, would mention—as exotic might look—
 statistical filtering models actually would want put even growth did,
 based course productivity past year. Now, models fooled
 early 1990s growth productivity picked up, development interpreted
 bigger step-up structural productivity fact turned case. Indeed, much
 step-up proved cyclical. feel quite comfortable discounted
 evidence. think risks sides that.
 I’d say one thing, too, looking forecast risks associated
 simply terms GDP growth rate way look it. revised
 supply side demand side forecast. fact, projection

 Again, think tried make clear Greenbook, recognize

 extent residual—that is, don’t know

 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 MR. STOCKTON. don’t lot science bring bear here.

 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Twelfth District economy continued
 expand recent weeks modest pace. Consumers turned disappointing
 performance holidays, early numbers January suggest remain
 hesitant price conscious. One retail consultant characterized current environment
 “race bottom,” consumers willing hold get goods cost. Retailers
 responded—offering nearly continuous sales, rebates, financing incentives, price
 guarantees. District businesses also looking bargains, especially real estate
 support services. One commercial landlord said fields daily calls tenants threatening
 move lease rates lowered. contract manager SUN Microsystems reported
 increased pressures lower prices long-term service contracts one-time technical

 Now, let say words state budget crises. genesis crises,
 West elsewhere well, appears overly optimistic revenue expectations
 and, lesser extent, cost overruns. Revenues running well expectations,
 especially large shortfalls states dependent capital gains revenues. cost side,
 Medicaid seems main culprit due rapid increases prescription drug prices

 January 28-29, 2003
 
 105 195
 
 budget shortfalls pose significant challenges state lawmakers,
 economic impact less clear. one thing, estimated budget shortfalls represent difference
 desired spending current revenues. represent budget deficits.
 Therefore, typically overstate tax increases cuts spending required
 balance budget. example, California projected shortfall, least projected
 governor, $35 billion. actually faces deficit $15 billion. another, states usually
 spread pain budget deficits several years, tempering immediate impact state
 spending employment growth. said, real costs large budget
 shortfalls. California’s bond rating downgraded part announcement

 current fiscal crisis equivalent faced state’s severe recession early

 Turning national economy, obviously recent data mixed,
