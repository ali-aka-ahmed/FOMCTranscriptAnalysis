 two explanations, third one, would seem credible context?
 MR. KOS. I’m sure third. way would tend look that,

 evolve going forward based experience markets people talk
 New York?
 MR. KOS. think answer “no”—I don’t view going forward. Certainly,
 there’s lot discussion markets—if one looks going junk bond
 market, example—that low interest rates perception abundant liquidity helped
 support risk assets high-yield bonds equities. don’t know whether that’s
 true, certainly perception. flip side coin that, monetary conditions
 change, markets would risk.
 MR. REINHART. would point out, Governor Ferguson, financial economists refer
 observed equity premiums historically neighborhood 500 600 basis points

 last decade doesn’t put well range last century so. Economists
 hard time understanding pricing equities importantly depends risk

 observing particularly variance historical norm.
 MR. FERGUSON. Okay, thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. page 3 charts juxtapose declining dollar

 hasn’t sharp decline dollar followed expected appreciation dollar

 MR. KOS. Well, that’s excellent question. way tend look
 current account deficit deficit financed somehow. cost financing

 dollar goes down. is, foreigner gets U.S. assets amount local

 that’s least simple model would look this. certain number
 investors willing buy dollars lower exchange rate expectation

 investors different time horizons.
 MR. BERNANKE. It’s puzzle.
 MR. KOS. It’s puzzle absolutely.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think certainly good point. Nonetheless it’s hard
 believe wouldn’t get significant volatility. don’t like 5 percent, try 1 percent,
 I’m sure you’d get lot volatility.
 MS. JOHNSON. Right, said, financing need would much smaller.
 MR. KOS. think that’s good point.

 that. situation reversed, back normal capital posture.

 Second, issues raised last meeting serious, central

 employment growth basically going consistent we’ve seen past.
 Frankly, don’t really much problem view. one certainly hears lot

 MR. STOCKTON. mentioned five-year inflation expectations, part,

 shifted views longer-term inflation objective. seems bit far-fetched
 big change expectations could occurred short period time. we’re
 somewhat skeptical that. Brian also mentioned hedging demands, think
 probably relatively short-lived effect. don’t know whether Brian Madigan Vincent wants
 say that.
 MR. MADIGAN. don’t much add that. would note probably
 mortgage-hedging activities prominent summer play role,
 makes little difficult interpret exact timing movements inflation

 MR. REINHART. point I’d add, President Moskow, difference
 nominal indexed yield inflation compensation includes inflation

 market participants may believe Committee’s views longer-term inflation
 expectations materially different, people markets might little uncertain
 whether that’s case. might well greater uncertainty that, given various

 areas, too. example, education medical care, one never heard

 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 MR. STOCKTON. would note two things think relevant. First, given
 spectacular increases productivity, one assigns even small portion going
 forward increase underlying productivity, that’s still major factor relieving
 cost pressures business side. Second, think special factors
 second half 1990s. inflation outlook we’re showing forecast
 nowhere near benign happened late 1990s, unemployment rate fell

 unemployment rate remains estimate natural rate, think
 getting much deceleration inflation. Part reason relates factors

 subsequently fell—and force contributed disinflation period.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 36 133
 
 although markup less leveling out, one could easily imagine
 going up.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would like start Committee discussion?
 MR. BROADDUS. Could ask one brief question? know we’ve gone
 quite time, quick question Karen building theme. Karen,
 sense weakness dollar may reflect concerns foreign
 exchange markets, especially part foreign investors, U.S. monetary policy
 accommodative? words, sense inflation expectations may
 showing indicators look at?
 MS. JOHNSON. guess I’d say “no” short answer. It’s certainly true
 central banks comment time time sense monetary accommodation.
 central banks different position. example, Bank England
 already raised rates, Reserve Bank Australia raised rates twice. think
 notion international financial circles global economy turned it’s time start
 raising rates—there even time people somehow thought Fed would go
 first—is prevalent. occasionally might hear press worries voiced
 countries that, Fed doesn’t act, act? turns don’t go
 first. Reserve Bank Australia certainly go first, did.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, isn’t mainly issue house-price inflation
 scaring central banks mentioned rather than—
 MS. JOHNSON. Well, that’s certainly piece it, although banks think
 quite legitimately see zero output gap. Australian economy
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 37 133
 
 performed remarkably strongly. need policy rates much closer
 equilibrium do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, discussed notion output gap
 doesn’t make difference there.
 MS. JOHNSON. Well, would use language even don’t. would say
 growing—
 SPEAKER(?). speed limits.
 MS. JOHNSON. various reasons economy growing around 4 percent
 times rather consistently. Now, England, think enormous tension
 housing prices one hand prices other. prices rising. There’s
 sense service sector economy versus manufacturing sector economy. One

 this—that Australian dollar one currencies appreciated

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, move economic discussion?
 President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Seventh District economy continues
 improve. Much uncertainty pervasive earlier year dissipated, many
 business contacts suggest economic growth region still somewhat less robust
 see national numbers.
 holiday shopping season got reasonably good start. retailers said
 sales days following Thanksgiving met expectations. Even old line department
 stores said fared well period. Several contacts noted inventories
 lean retailers trying cut back discounting. consumers still seem
 price sensitive. Many retailers reported us strong post-Thanksgiving sales
 largely reflected purchases deeply discounted merchandise. One national specialty retailer
 sharply cut back discounting noted sales company slowed considerably
 unexpectedly last weeks.
 know, nationally light vehicle sales picked November slightly
 higher automakers’ expectations. generally improving economy, automakers
 raised sales forecasts next year. Friday Chicago Fed hosting annual
 economic outlook symposium, auto industry participants forecasting light vehicle
 sales 16.6 16.9 million units 2004, least 300,000 units
 Greenbook projection. broadly, 35 individuals submitted forecasts 2004 overall
 economy, consensus among generally similar December Blue Chip

 last meeting mentioned waiting manufacturers shift
 cautiously optimistic plain optimistic. seems happening. We’re
 hearing reports strong orders, increasing backlogs, cases even
 firmer prices. example, vast majority participants fab tech trade show held
 Chicago last month said new orders fabricating equipment up. especially
 encouraging given low capacity utilization rates. addition, producers heavy equipment
 variety sectors noted strengthening demand; examples include construction, agricultural
 food processing, drilling, airline service equipment.
 Labor markets continue improve. contacts two large temporary help firms said
 number workers assignment continues rise steadily, also indicated
 increases expectations given strong GDP growth we’ve seen. We’ve
 received preliminary results Manpower’s first-quarter hiring plan survey, index
 improved moderately fourth quarter 2003 first quarter 2004, slightly
 year-ago level. Let note information released publicly
 December 16.
 Turning national outlook, recent data encouraging.
 Employment hours continue improve, although Friday’s report somewhat weaker
 expected. Household sector demand remains solid, last corporate decisionmakers
 become optimistic. confidence appears translating broad-based
 increase spending we’ve waiting for. Firms seem shifting inventory

 think need start preparing markets inevitable rate increases. preference
 start today, perhaps minor changes wording statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Twelfth District economy gained
 momentum recent months, posting solid growth broad range sectors. Consumers
 continue part. Early reports Thanksgiving holiday weekend suggest
 shoppers force spending. Contacts noted retailers approaching
 holiday season leaner inventories, hoping avoid heavy discounting cut
 margins last year.
 District businesses also increased spending entering contracts advertisers,
 marketing firms, support firms. One advertising consultant said that, months
 cutting costs, firms begun turn attention building revenues. improvement
 business conditions good news commercial landlords. Several contacts noted
 pickup number firms renewing rather relinquishing leases. Finally, effects
 sustained economic growth started show labor market. pickup hiring
 broad-based, sectors still shedding jobs. Contacts suggest
 improvement transitory. Many firms say need increase payrolls
 demand grows; nonetheless, plan remain cautious.
 Despite improved economic conditions, state budget troubles continue issue,
 especially California. California lawmakers special session effort
 gain control state budget. First need close $17 billion hole current fiscal
 year. near-term hole filled, legislators still need close $14 billion structural
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 41 133
 
 gap coming fiscal year. governor proposed resolving near-term shortfall
 $15 billion deficit-reduction general-obligation bonds $2 billion spending cuts
 deferrals. wants close longer-term structural gap cap expenditures next year
 rules limiting spending growth future years. governor taking budget plan
 public, campaigning across state. time, State Treasurer Angelides also
 going public, making case governor’s plan. Angelides Democrats
 prefer cover near-term shortfall tax increases intermediate-term borrowing.
 plan closing $14 billion structural gap consists modest reductions spending together
 ongoing deferrals additional loans. Despite vast differences parties,
 heat reach compromise. governor’s proposal requires voter approval,
 legislature need act quickly get proposal March 2, 2004, ballot. Without
 resolution, California cash flow crisis next June fiscal trouble
 time come.
 Turning national economy, recent data better expected again;
 like Greenbook, optimistic economy going forward. expect real
 GDP growth 4 percent quarter average 5 percent next year
 4 percent 2005. Unlike Greenbook, forecast assumes funds rate begin
 move early middle next year. Naturally, growth rates imply rising levels
 resource utilization forecast period. expect unemployment rate fall
 5¼ percent year-end next year 5 percent middle 2005. Still, economy
 considerable slack near term, inflation likely remain subdued, core
 PCE prices rising shade 1 percent next two years.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 42 133
 
 Although inflation forecast last time, seems
 risks same. Specifically, recent data appear reduced risk deflation.
 I’ve already mentioned faster-than-expected output growth; also less concerned
 inflation data earlier. may recall, think even mentioned earlier
 today, core PCE inflation showed zero growth several months first half
 year. case late. Financial market developments point
 direction. instance, dollar obviously falling recently. don’t mean claim
 there’s risk deflation. Continued high productivity growth, example, could exert
 downward pressure prices. However, I’d less worried deflation source.

 large discrepancy. Now, know payroll survey problems picking births

 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. economic news since last
 meeting heartening. odds begun strong sustainable expansion
 risen significantly. rise growth, we’re going see even op-ed
 articles, wire stories, editorials opining Fed needs tighten soon avoid repeat
 1980s-style inflation. Wall Street Journal today editorial along lines. believe
 critics particularly well informed that, Committee, continue
 remain patient choke growth unnecessarily. particular, though course
 vigilant detect change inflation trend, odds inflation rising significantly
 time soon current low level seem small.
 Let make points. First, Street elsewhere lately
 worrying inflation tended point primarily raw materials prices,
 rising, dollar, falling. largely reiterate things
 Dave Stockton said. Board staff’s Monday briefing, believe posted
 electronically, debunked importance raw materials argument quite convincingly
 view. briefing includes graph historical data, shows even large
 movements raw materials prices—which quite common way—appear
 muted effects intermediate goods prices and, important, discernible effects
 final goods inflation. Presumably lack inflationary impact reflects fact raw
 materials small part total costs. another figure briefing showed, unit labor
 costs— which, course, falling rapidly productivity surged wage growth
 slowed—are far important inflation determination materials prices.
 analysis similar raw materials would apply dollar. we’ve
 seeing, large movements dollar major currencies tend translate smaller

 modest part overall price index. short, ultimate effect dollar depreciation
 magnitude seen broad measures core inflation likely quite small
 indeed.
 noted key role unit labor costs inflation. course, unit labor costs
 continue fall recent rate. Indeed, employment picks up, productivity growth
 particular slow markedly. Critics may point decline productivity growth another
 incipient source inflationary pressure. would note prospective productivity
 decline fully incorporated Greenbook forecast us. particular,
 Greenbook forecast assumes productivity growth fall significantly trend 2004
 2005 employment picks up, specifically 1.7 percent 2004 0.5 percent
 2005. Given recent experience, seems entirely possible assumptions
 conservative productivity growth, though decelerating, nevertheless higher
 staff assumed next two years. so, would tend increase risks
 disinflation.
 Finally, although output gaps course hard measure, weight
 evidence continues support believe considerable slack remains economy.
 Let give one bit evidence point. recent New York Times article Chicago
 economist Austan Goolsbee argued rise unemployment rate past two years
 understates degree labor market weakness. reason today large percentage
 job losers, greater fraction past, simply withdraw labor force, example,
 apply Social Security disability benefits. looked data ratio employment

 combination 1980 1981-82 recessions, unemployment rate

 February 1983 3.0 percentage points. decline attributed 1981-82 recession

 2000 comparable occurred deep 1981-82 recession.
 comparison, movement employment-to-population ratio peak trough

 Possibly extent recent decline exaggerated employment

 look risk regard economic growth—if risk assessed
 growth rate—I’d say risk upside. However, look economy’s
 performance relative level potential output, gap significant. many people
 already mentioned, estimate output gap hard come by. Greenbook
 forecast see unemployment continues run relatively high, we’re assuming
 5 percent full employment NAIRU perspective. However, Dave Stockton already
 mentioned, standard deviation 1 percentage point unemployment rate. Many us
 remember late ’90s unemployment got well 5 percent without inflation

 risk assessment would interact first substantive paragraph statement go
 much beyond thinking minutes released, forth.
 believe decision minutes viewed separate issue
 debated Committee whole. don’t necessarily, group seven, add
 particular value process helping think issues involved that.
 context focusing risk assessment, turns
 recommendations came basically three different approaches, flavors will,
 differed three basic respects. One difference involved specificity risk
 assessment given—in particular question whether sense benchmark
 associated it. second thing seemed divide various options
 presented dealt discussion levels changes output gaps
 inflation gaps. mixed them, tried divide neatly. third
 difference specificity regarding length time period. proposals
 favored fairly vague time frame, retained language “foreseeable future.”
 approaches recommended us supported specific time frame references measured terms
 quarters, months, even years. looked three elements basically came
 three archetypes, will, put together various components; that’s
 we’re going focus remainder life working group.
 first page, gives overview, shows three
 types proposals. I’m going ask comment vote them.
 provided see look like, recognizing Committee
 plenty time work language.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 105 133
 
 first proposal—just terms elements talked looking
 detail language—basically merges levels changes. several suggestions
 fell category; merged levels changes alluded benchmarks.
 number people wanted overall risk-assessment sentence. see,
 referring long-run goals price stability long-run goals sustained economic growth,
 time horizon used approach elastic notion foreseeable future.
 proposal represents cluster approaches deal risk assessment. Notice also
 risk-assessment paragraph, that’s we’re going stress option.
 Proposal B somewhat explicit levels addresses first
 paragraph. example references things inflation remaining well
 contained slack remaining considerable. includes discussion levels, that’s
 separate discussion changes. one puts judgment regarding changes
 second paragraph, reflecting certain style seemed come several
 recommendations received. alludes benchmarks overall risk assessment
 somewhat less structured less quantifiable way, terms “long-run sustainable
 pace,” et cetera. uses much specific time frame—the next quarters—than
 elastic concept foreseeable future. proposal reflected another cluster thoughts
 received. Again, see one works primarily risk assessment
 leave clear expectation first paragraph would tend language deals
 levels. that’s handled levels versus changes dilemma.
 third proposal much focused whole statement. explicit
 levels, primarily first substantive paragraph, leaving changes basically
 second paragraph risk assessment. one alludes benchmarks first paragraph.

 doesn’t talk inflation necessarily contained puts
 broader context. proposal moves us, frankly, much direction we’ve never
 traveled. sense radical options considering
 talk forecast. refers second paragraph Committee’s assessment
 risks outlook terms forecast economic growth coming period.
 explicit forecast period—the next two years case—and references
 potential developments might change forecast. really wanted see us
 move direction. would new territory Committee.
 Importantly, go direction proposal C, think really imply
 broader set changes Committee dynamics. say get us talking
 forecasts every meeting take time quite different riskassessment discussion. Committee adopt approach, ought recognize
 likely effect Committee dynamics—that require time look
 statement time think outlook might be. sense
 logical progression we’ve since risk assessment originally intended
 forward-looking tone. puts much weight forward-looking aspect
 involves forecast type statement Committee. Going direction, repeat,
 reflects desire enough Committee members working group thought least
 worth considering.
 broad types statements looking at. would discourage
 getting terribly focused specific set words would ask really think
 whether mixture we’ve put together one might like basis
 discussions.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 107 133
 
 second point I’d like make part time allotted issue today
 intend stress-test various options. combination Reserve Bank Board staff
 look six scenarios we’ve identified, including recent episodes
 proven challenging. goal here, always case, try see various
 types risk assessments stack whatever developments likely occur whatever
 curves think economy might throw us. Again, we’re going prescient
 anybody else, one hopes six scenarios we’ll cover things
 likely happen—or certainly scenarios think likely
 problematic. come back January we’ll results stress tests,
 we’ll see ones seem work ones seem fail certain circumstances.
 Recognizing phone calls letters asking us think
 communication policy broadly, Board’s staff prepare memos dealing
 suggestions expediting release minutes. staff also look
 general going even beyond types statements I’ve outlined today enhancing role
 forecasts, since people suggested approach. Again, something
 working group going give proposal recommendation,
 provided input discussion we’re going January.
 Finally, material going sent everyone advance two-day meeting
 January think there’ll plenty opportunity level setting, will. give
 us chance talk risk assessment statement broadly even expand
 discussion questions interaction minutes forecasting becoming
 fairly normal part Committee dynamics.

 that’s propose. said, stage working group seeking
 specific comments language—though obviously want—but rather
 affirmation process I’ve outlined. seek views whether varieties
 flavors statement I’ve shown would sufficient, think would be,
 give kind thoughtful input allow us focused intelligent
 conversation two-day meeting January. That’s six seven minutes time,
 it’s much go today. Cathy Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Roger. I’m little worried here. would go back
 said earlier. gotten situation where—in terminology used
 before—we lot moving parts statement. None proposals
 presented—without going details them—diminishes moving parts all. It’s
 possible, based brief glance, proposals actually may add moving parts. don’t
 think that’s direction want go. think aiming minimize rather
 maximize number things talk statement release every meeting.
 believe get increasing amounts trouble try expand cover yet keep
 wording short pithy enough—that is, without logic back-and-forth discussion
 went Committee meeting—to press statement meeting
 view, conversation telephone, endeavors
 working group preclude discussion January statement shorter
 sweeter—perhaps confining it. could let

 alternatives amount moving parts—albeit phrased somewhat differently
 focused somewhat differently—will result receiving huge papers topic five days,
 say, two-day meeting. enormous amounts material assimilate anyway,
 give us time discuss proposal perspective might
 well fleshed these. I’m worried we’re going continue along line don’t

 MR. FERGUSON. Okay. Chairman wants speak, want respond

 MR. FERGUSON. No, speak turn. recognized you, definition

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. want support Cathy saying,
 point view somebody figure get consensus group.
 It’s far easier get requisite number members support policy support

 Therefore, far easier get group support actual policy get consensus

 Nonetheless, complex process, want agree Cathy
 reducing number moving parts going important. also avoid like
 plague, Michelle Smith 2:15 p.m. deadline releasing statement press,
 anything extend meetings well beyond ordinarily adjourn. take

 finish time. alternative. go 4:00 p.m. announcement
 let press know well advance changing time plan release
 statement. go later want. lots implications
 whole communications business.
 MR. FERGUSON. Let say couple things. One Committee
 collectively decide trouble it’s worth communicating
 need communicate. conclude none options feels right
 variety reasons. merely say interesting but, looked
 stress test results everything else, Committee think longer want try
 provide anything public statement forward-looking. may reach conclusion
 process reasons substance reasons. may decide like meetings
 last 9 a.m. 1 p.m. nothing precludes, Mr. Chairman, Committee’s
 ultimately deciding whole risk-assessment approach forward-looking approach
 we’ve worked worth candle.
 MS. MINEHAN. we’re likely pored fifty-page paper!
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 111 133
 
 MR. FERGUSON. We’re leaving Committee decide whether
 risk-assessment forward-looking element statement. don’t think
 felt appropriate little subgroup anything say clearly
 option statement. We’re taking option away you.
 follow process first side those—if majority view—who want us try
 work approach. certainly that. nothing taking step precludes
 Committee ultimately deciding doesn’t want go path. agree,
 however, options would imply meeting starts earlier goes later
 currently case, I’m sure Committee wants that.
 one thing notes last meeting four
 members—Governor Bies, Presidents Santomero, Hoenig, McTeer—weren’t able
 speak topic close 2:00 p.m. adjourn. don’t know
 four wants jump stage, call order. also
 Governor Gramlich President Parry indicating today want say something.
 matter courtesy organizational discipline, think owe
 precluded speaking last time opportunity comment today wish. Therefore,
 Governor Bies, President Santomero, President Hoenig, President McTeer, order,
 want say anything please so.
 MS. BIES. Let make couple comments. would hope, make decision

 issue. people read minutes, chance see variety viewpoints

 us willing bend get answer different place, think
 minutes reflect clearly. worry statement may get very, long, like
 idea keeping press release cleaner simpler. I’m looking forward seeing
 practically done minutes perspective.
 Second, personally reluctant go path giving frequent forecasts
 making commitments. mind presumes we’re omniscient
 going occur future think are. also raises questions
 confronted situation spring Iraqi war, couldn’t
 even assess near-term much less longer-term outlook. Presidential elections come up,
 lot things happen. I’m concerned trying give forecast
 outlook regular meeting. Now, might want think Chairman
 communicates Congress twice year testimony monetary policy;
 separately. routinely try forecast every six-week interval find
 problematic. also want say like stress-testing idea. One things
 found relationship falling inflation economic growth—the Phillips
 curve kind tradeoff—got bit whack year. like notion stress testing

 MR. FERGUSON. President Santomero next list.
 MR. SANTOMERO. It’s little hard pick introductory discussion last
 time, let respond I’m seeing me. think idea projecting two
 years continuously forecasting outlook two years ahead going harm
 credibility aid clarifying announcements. must admit don’t see use
 types statements likely sustainable scenario. would one response.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 113 133
 
 Second, question much want cover announcement,
 essentially issue President Minehan suggesting think about, worth
 addressing directly. options A, B, C, option ought alternative
 pare back statement. Maybe best way get questions people
 give input writing you’ve shown us today, determine way
 respond. fact everybody says “C” way go, that’s fine. everybody says “D”
 way go, help Committee group figure do. think
 still lot open questions here.
 third point I’d make relates question time. Chairman noted, it’s
 approaching 2:00 p.m. now. critical decisions, question time need
 discuss becoming issue. Committee may want think that—whether
 want move announcement 4:00 p.m. start meetings 8:00 a.m. ought
 least address timing issue, opportunity talk matters way
 constructive.
 MR. FERGUSON. Tom Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. I’m quite sure say, Roger. started out, I’ve thought
 communications last months, thinking earlier release minutes
 would provide us opportunity cut back statement. indicated earlier
 memo us cutting back statement, even coupled earlier release
 minutes, would viewed step back terms information provide. causes
 think forecasts submit twice year preparation semiannual reports
 monetary policy focus communications outlook. I’d rather
 forecasts provide Congress reports—along relevant Committee
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 114 133
 
 minutes—be vehicle use put range views rather risk statement,
 dissatisfying effort communicate markets
 whomever else. So, since we’ve opened door options choose here,
 would say really would like pare back press release. I’d try provide sooner
 rather later greater sense variety valuable views among Committee members
 differences come ultimately lead consensus. that’s two cents
 worth.
 MR. FERGUSON. Okay. Bob McTeer list last time,
 Ned Gramlich, Bob Parry, Bill Poole. think still dilemma
 last month end discussion 2:00 p.m.
 MR. MCTEER. agree Cathy statement shorter simpler—
 much so. I’ve long argued, don’t think favor started
 announcing bias vote. would recommend bias vote. don’t it,
 we’re nontransparent releasing it. it’s fairly obvious way policy ought
 going meeting, think ought go rather nothing promise,
 bias vote, likely next time. Whenever act, people outside
 know pretty much information do; don’t really need much
 explanation voted way did. think leave much
 flexibility announcements fewer moving parts, fewer ways make
 mistake leave bias. requires releasing minutes earlier, fine.
 That’s right me. don’t think even that. I’d say we’ve found
 recently lengthy press releases announcements various biases served us
 well preferred go back old system.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 115 133
 
 MR. FERGUSON. Ned Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. I’ll try quick. terms writing relatively formulaic
 statement moving parts, know tried last time, happens
 sorts difficulties arise. People ask, going problem?
 going problem? don’t want clear issue issue.
 statement gets complicated murkier. So, frankly, don’t think kind
 statement going work.
 second point group think minutes panacea. It’s
 separate issue. might get sooner, even do, we’re still going
 issue statement day meeting. world going want bottom line, either
 give it, somebody else give it. I’d propose, Roger suggested,
 treat separate issue deal post-meeting statement best can.
 Third, may attractive alternative options material Roger passed
 out. exactly today—to issue short statement every meeting. vote
 go forward. happens situations face checkered tailored
 different it’s hard design formula moving parts work every
 meeting. want give statement, reflective think. That’s type
 statement agreed today—a short statement describes think going
 economy. that, would say statement short—no
 seven eight sentences. personally would recommend compulsory halfhour period read draft statement think it. shouldn’t rush ram
 through. actually try something democratic talk it. result
 longer meetings, that’s right me. don’t tolerance meetings

 think have. setting interest rates influence
 throughout world economy. may take us another two hours that.
 MR. FERGUSON. Bob Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Roger, Cathy referred three options lots moving
 parts. think different. number moving parts number things
 agree different. One proposals language we’ve actually used years
 never problems with—or least few. agree don’t want
 lot moving parts, think three options regard.
 seems look three alternatives.
 MR. FERGUSON. say, judgment call, obviously, nineteen
 different judges. Bill, what’s view?
 MR. POOLE. I’d like see proposal that’s pretty close A—I’ll call prime—
 would focus reasons policy decision meeting would minimal
 amount forward-looking elements. judge risks roughly balanced,
 leave federal funds rate alone. judge risks becoming unbalanced
 particular direction, either raise funds rate lower it, risk assessment would
 explanation took action did. That’s point number one—that think
 could recast along lines.
 Second, would urge stress-testing take actual situations faced
 meetings of, let’s say, last five years determine would done regard
 statement meetings. may scenarios would want stress
 test addition that. would like see history rerun, will, see
 statement would looked like September 1998 whatever proposal.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 117 133
 
 MR. FERGUSON. Well, guess I’m going last words
 minutes left. Here’s I’ve noted. heard range views three options,
 don’t think heard anyone say let’s stress-test them. may ultimately say it’s
 complicated let’s go new type statement, didn’t hear anyone say “please
 stop process now.” think need continue process, perhaps broadening
 stress testing little, make sure pick range situations know occurred
 last five years. I’m sure every meeting one recall
 series meetings inflation looked picking series
 meetings looked though inflation falling off. long cover wide
 range circumstances, think respond issues raised stress testing.
 second thing heard clearly keep table two options
 aren’t specifically set material. One simply cut back press statement
 altogether minimize forward-looking aspects it. we’ll include clearly
 option discussed, there’s stress testing that—or little
 working group regard option.
 I’d say thing respect focus minutes released early.
 That’s clearly something people want talk about. leave enough time
 two-day meeting cover that, though it’s slightly independent aspect
 communications policy. already planned discuss expediting minutes and,
 said, think requires input Board staff think market may react,
 pros cons taking step, et cetera. two issues—what
 statement minutes—do interact little. Michelle warned us times,
 appear stepping back transparency statement giving something else

 stead, make difference public reaction. two decisions
 interrelated degree. sense share Bob McTeer’s frustration bias
 statement—had never voted tilt we’d never disclose it—our problem
 we’ve voted tilt many years. eliminating would lead great market
 consternation. So, course, can’t wind tape back whenever Committee
 decided first vote tilt.
 three things hear. fourth that, Ned Gramlich said, sense
 length meetings relevant factor this. don’t know right answer
 that. would say it’s certainly something going consider. Ned
 right, think degree is—we’re setting interest rates least world’s largest
 complex economy world—the attempt nineteen people
 three hours may manage. may longer stage
 that. may decide we’re longer setting rates we’re talking economy
 setting implications policy future. We’re setting rates, we’re trying figure
 best explain it, we’re looking forward. That’s lot nineteen people
 three hours.
 MR. MCTEER. think that’s red herring. don’t think anybody room would
 argue that, choose one options, short meetings. There’s argument
 that.
 MR. FERGUSON. No, I’m suggesting one things may come
 January meeting general consensus need start meetings little earlier. don’t
 know. I’m saying that’s part discussion we’re going have. I’m
 putting option traded things.
 
 December 9, 2003
 
 119 133
 
 MS. MINEHAN. But, Roger, think it’s important recognize us
 favor shorter, simpler statement, length meeting nothing whatsoever
 preference. spend ten hours arguing policy, I’d happy that.
 MR. FERGUSON. Well, fact it’s 2:00 p.m. [Laughter] trying filibuster
 that. No, say two issues interchangeable. may decide want
 different length meeting independent decide statement.
 issue bubbled decided. Now, Chairman may agreement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let indicate good congressional
 tradition clock stopped 2:00 p.m.
 MR. FERGUSON. It’s proceed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, unless somebody formidably important
 issues raise point, meeting adjourned.
