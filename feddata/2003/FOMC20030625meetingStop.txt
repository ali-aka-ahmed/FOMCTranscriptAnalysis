 Chairman mentioned word “Japan.” Prior remarks, heard two briefings lasted
 forty-five minutes hour, issue Japan come up. I’d like know,
 recognizing Japan severe problems banking system

 policies we’re talking about. Perhaps started late, perhaps communication wasn’t

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Let try link discussion situation point
 Roger raising Japan think Japanese experience provide
 important lessons. don’t data front me, early ’90s money stock
 actually fell Japan several years running. Japan made mistake time
 early 1930s, Federal Reserve many others thought policy
 becoming easier interest rates going when, fact, central bank
 pulling liquidity system. Certainly one important lesson early ’30s
 United States elsewhere early ’90s Japan pay attention
 aggregates extreme circumstances.
 Second, another key feature Japanese environment, although much recent
 months, important binding exchange rate constraint. Japan never felt
 comfortable pursuing policy provide liquidity might consequence allowing
 yen depreciate substantially dollar. think widely understood

 29 211
 
 Japanese society, probably lot informal ways Japan ensuring
 currency depreciate applicable environment. that’s type
 price constraint, will, prevented Japanese going far might
 otherwise gone pursuing quantitative target.
 think it’s important realize basic point can’t fix price
 quantity. price—the federal funds rate—gets zero, view really
 don’t choice concentrate quantity force lot liquidity
 system. fact, there’s rather interesting symmetry situation. inflation rate
 relatively high, also turns interest rates give misleading indications
 confusion much rates driven changes inflation expectations. Countries
 gotten inflationary problems great difficulty running policy terms

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. came pretty much
 regard four questions—so I’ll attenuate remarks—but let briefly explain why.
 We’re conversation, least perspective, concerns
 possibility deflation. ask might concerned deflation, exhibit 1
 one answer—the Depression. may consensus causes Great
 Depression, people usually cite crisis banking, inappropriate monetary policy, wage
 stickiness collusion labor market, maybe Smoot-Hawley Act. None

 go policies, serious resource misallocations trying preserve dying
 uncompetitive industries, forth. Again, case Depression,
 conditions seem largely absent economy today.
 third possible reason come concern today
 disappointment rate growth economy. Depending time period one
 selects, economy growing 1½ 2½ 3 percent last group quarters.
 suspicion that, growing 4 5 percent more, wouldn’t
 concerned—even price indexes going rate 1 percent so, plus minus—about
 possibility deflation. judgment right, we’re really concerned
 pace economic growth. seems involved in, least
 moment, fairly traditional exercise economic stimulus effort boost
 aggregate demand. suggests primary focus
 incremental policy changes, any.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would agree that,

 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Bob!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree presentations
 we’ve heard three background memos prepared discussion
 excellent. enjoyed reading papers took lot away them. Vincent, Dino,
 David, want say think memo colleagues really fleshed
 issues.
 took away three main points background memos. First, money markets
 adapt low interest rates involves costs, costs bearing far
 push rates contemplate approaches deal persistent
 disinflation, fact get something like that. Second, evidence 1930s presented
 Athanasios’s excellent memo think clearly suggested construe
 evidence indication monetary policy ineffective zero bound nominal
 interest rates. Third, 1940s succeed enforcing 2½ percent ceiling
 government bond yields partly commitment keeping expected short rates low
 1947 large-scale purchases long bonds thereafter. interesting
 points, enjoyed reading memorandums.
 
 June 24-25, 2003
 
 34 211
 
 respect strategy tactics going forward—trying apply
 lessons history even looking beyond them—I recognize may able address
 disinflation inducing significant additional reductions long-term interest rates
 whether explicitly target not. That’s people seem thinking
 next step. I’d like add new dimension discussion bond rates, like
 short rates, also subject zero bound point, ultimately would put limit
 policy channel disinflation persisted deflation began threaten us. I’d like talk
 I’ll refer “what next” issue couple minutes. issue is,
 think monetary stimulus get point long-
 short-term interest rate policies essentially immobilized?
 Now, agree lot people—although I’m sure many people around
 table here—that odds face situation small may exceedingly small.
 that, it’s tempting conclude plenty time really don’t need
 think discuss yet. words, we’ll cross bridge get it.
 would argue it’s useful actually urgent think kinds
 options now. I’m building point making, Cathy, confronting deflation
 like confronting inflation involves credibility problem. That’s essence me.
 Moreover, unlike inflation, credibility problem dealing deflation compounded
 zero bound nominal interest rates. raises least possibility interest rate
 policy alone can’t deter deflation even we’re willing drive short- long-term interest
 rates zero.
 current situation—I'm going talk current policy use
 framework situation—if funds rate get closer zero, possibility

 deflation potential create deflation expectations actual deflation simply
 people may doubt use monetary policy combat deflation effectively
 zero bound. concern waiting say think would deliver
 monetary stimulus rates fall zero could circumstances lead public
 conclude can’t it. people think can’t deliver, would risk creating
 credibility deficit could make much difficult deal situation fact
 arises try use different types policies deal it. that’s think it’s
 essential begin talk consider now. I’m talking developing
 detailed strategy least putting something table.
 So, next? Well, common sense tells us, pointed already,
 point determined expansion monetary base effective deflation
 zero bound. case, could eliminate taxes, government
 could permanently finance operations money creation alone. next step
 use referred quantitative policies discussion. principle, think
 can’t denied would work. practice, though, lot obstacles creating
 credibility kinds policies. Let mention them.
 particular, bang buck quantitative policy zero bound point
 anybody’s guess. could quite weak practice. don’t know. least
 possibility might expand balance sheet enormously—well beyond normal
 steady-state size—to effective. Further, since short-term government securities perfect
 substitutes base zero bound, probably would accomplish
 expansion purchases longer-term securities, first government securities
 private securities. that, already mentioned, would require us exit
 
 June 24-25, 2003
 
 36 211
 
 strategy draining large quantities monetary base deflation broken—if
 fact earlier increase base substantially. Since would selling long-term
 bonds back public volume normal 3 4 percent rates, purchased
 rates near zero, could face substantial capital loss. Conceivably, really unusual
 situation, could insufficient assets portfolio bring base back down.
 latter situation, would presumably arrangement Treasury
 recapitalize us short-term government debt allow us complete draining operations.
 Let quickly recapitulate key points I’ve tried make here. first that,

 lot don’t understand, would like know ever

 would address important issues Al Broaddus raised.
 one question immediately came mind course Vincent’s

 add reserves one segment Treasury market drain other.
 wondering could without undermining effectiveness really
 trying accomplish, given way arbitrage operates people move along curve,

 MR. REINHART. think short answer every confidence Dino,
 [laughter] may transactions large size. One could imagine, instance,
 Committee calling ceiling five-year note yield—one would hope would

 calling 1 percentage point federal funds target. would mean Dino would

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. I, too, going echo comments others, couple
 points I’d like make. One that, I’m worried money market funds,
 say, concerned—putting supervisory hat—that we’re telling everybody make sure
 understand credit exposures. point, interest rates could get low

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let first start context,
 agree Gary Stern others context this—as think you’ve
 indicated—is reigniting economic growth. We’ll talk tomorrow,
 shouldn’t lose track point President Stern raised—namely, economy

 MR. FERGUSON. We’ll split difference call island magistrate would
 say. Let proceed evidence, might. First, evidence supporting sense
 things looking better, I’d say number straws wind support
 assessment. They’ve talked today. Retail sales grew respectably May,
 labor markets appear stabilizing, data we’ve received new existing
 home sales certainly sign continued robustness sector. It’s surprising
 household sector seems reasonably strong underlying fundamentals sector
 look strong. Real disposable income improved number reasons; stock market
 obviously contributed positively household balance sheets; mentioned earlier,
 ongoing opportunities refinancing. consumer confidence seems, balance,
 firming somewhat. one moves household sector look industrial side
 economy, straws wind. IP stabilized, number people
 said, survey data Reserve Bank regional surveys ISM give sense
 perhaps firming manufacturing sector. Finally important, we’ve
 already noted, financial conditions quite consistent turning. Equity prices up;
 risk spreads down; Vincent Dino indicated yesterday, forwardlooking indicators risk also suggest improvement. number reasons
 bit cautious optimism. would put emphasis “cautious.” doesn’t seem
 yet type self-reinforcing improvement we’d need see decide

 Let also go bits evidence perhaps disprove case. First, would
 say it’s really clear financial markets telling us. Normally could look

 forward-looking tell us something real economy. listened
 discussion yesterday thought myself, seemed question
 markets’ assessment real economy. someone said yesterday, part seems
 driving fixed-income markets search yield expectation interest rates
 remain low. Neither necessarily indicates market sees real economy improving.
 one looks equity markets, heard yesterday—which consistent I’ve
 heard I’m thinking general—is seeing data corporate sector
 getting worse may stabilizing. recent data certainly consistent
 rapid turnaround. bit question whether not, someone said earlier,
 may looking mirror. least question whether financial conditions

 sure they’re yet indicative growth.
 second reason I’d somewhat cautious relates fact spent lot time

 CEOs talked said issues

 I’d put question mark outlook corporate sector particularly investment
 side that.
 third area concern I’d consumer sector. many
 fundamentals look good, fact unemployment rate staying relatively high job
 creation relatively muted least risk weighing household sector
 past. I’m sure will, might.
 one puts two sides together adds stimulus pipeline
 monetary fiscal policy, see staff came baseline forecast, I’m
 going quibble strongly that. believe risks forecast

 Nevertheless, even take forecast given look past next
 quarters, see number things happening. One output gap still closes relatively
 slowly. Second, unemployment rate hangs NAIRU next year. Third,
 core PCE even adjustment stays would consider low end

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions Vincent?
 MR. GRAMLICH. Yesterday number people raised question, “If zero isn’t
 really lower bound, is?” think general feeling don’t know
 lower bound it’s 75 basis points. went funds rate 75 basis

 we’re going go?
 MR. REINHART. think risk moving balance current
 circumstances would interpreted funds rate low Committee really
 wanted go. Given misperception 75 basis points might bottom end

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.

 MR. PARRY. two questions, Vincent. First, look middle chart

 MR. REINHART. case 25 basis points would get easy policy
 as, say, first half last year.

 MR. REINHART. it’s also case sense forecast going forward
 probably positive year ago even May.
 MR. PARRY. Okay. Second, want raise issue, wrong time,
 come back it. exhibit 5 bottom left-hand corner, panel entitled “For today’s
 choice” says growth rate risks balanced. issue want raise point
 relates word “sustainable” shows adjective statement. really think
 way used last time wrong. checked we’ve used past, think
 different. seems problem could fixed easily using word
 “acceptable.” may focused point seems narrow some, don’t think
 “sustainable” right word last time, can’t see would right time.
 don’t know you’ve given thought come conclusion it, wanted
 mention it. talk later?
 MR. REINHART. One thing learned people read different things
 word “sustainable.” think members would view words “sustainable growth”
 saying growth rate potential.
 MR. PARRY. May exactly meant.
 
 June 24-25, 2003
 
 137 211
 
 MR. REINHART. Whereas think others felt word “sustainable” also
 includes level concept it. is, economy well level potential,
 growth rate could sustain next several quarters actually higher
 potential.
 MR. PARRY. Well, seems it’s little problematic view one way one month
 different way another month.
 MR. REINHART. think word ambiguous. that’s one reason would like
 point put Committee’s agenda discussion communication policy.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Maybe going wait discussion communication.
 One things struggled read Bluebook wording— see
 exhibit 5 bottom left box—is part inflation risks downside.
 worried disinflation, see significant risk, worried
 inflation road. inflation around 3 percent, we’d worried risk
 rise inflation. Risk always implies something could worst outcome
 rather direction. Given regard inflation, I’m wondering
 imply concern inflation’s moving one direction rather risk
 going down. Getting back Governor Bernanke’s comments, communicate
 views inflation important. we’re unusual situation, think directional
 words might better word “risk.”
 MR. REINHART. proposal proposal Bluebook trying

 means choice 50 25 basis points. Given fiscal stimulus

 50 basis points may bit much. I’ve listened discussion today thought
 it, must say would like bit cushion. things unfold

 Working risk assessment way you’ve outlined seems quite consistent last

 there’s possibility another 25 beyond that. addressing questions could punt

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t survey members rather get
 discussion right now, obviously don’t need today—
 MR. MOSKOW. No, I’m talking longer term.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. understand. It’s critical question ought
 proceed get communication issues straightened out. We’ve moved forward since
 last meeting, apparently effectively, that’s end game. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. Like several others,
 torn 25 50 basis points. put well, huge stimulus
 coming tax package that’s take effect, accordance traditional
 economic theory, provide impetus get economic growth projected
 Greenbook. reason I’m comfortable cut 25 rather 50 basis
 points right now.
 support President Moskow’s direction thinking regarding talk
 things. moment, world CEOs everybody else worried risks,
 even imply opportunity growth 4 5 percent seen risk seems
 best choice words. might want find better words convey message way
 encourage see growth necessary get economic performance
 potential use excess capacity human resources. think it’s time look
 try address comments Governor Bernanke made.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Mr. Chairman, also support recommendation 25 basis
 point cut. reason support need address disinflation risk. statement

 risk, intermeeting period validated concerns way strengthen
 public’s conviction would act today. called attention risk, think
 obligated follow rhetoric action. others said, uncharted territories
 contain risks would wise avoid, think action help us avoid
 risks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. also support parts recommendation. seems that,
 accordance signaled May, easing appropriate. consistent
 pipeline, particularly fiscal stimulus, ¼ point move seems appropriate. think we’ve
 also set high threshold terms responsibility communicate,
 view ought look question carefully. joined Fed

 intense focus every word Fed, become incrementalist
 terms change manner communicate. believe ought think
 carefully that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation well
 reasoning. I’d like follow briefly answer President Poole. wonder
 might give thought whether would make sense tactically say publicly
 willing lower federal funds rate zero necessary. realize cost
 that, see two advantages. First, might allow us defer gracefully longer
 period issue might run room. is, question comes up,

 could say, well, we’re still 100 basis points away that. Second, think would
 beneficial effect expectations would longer feeling market
 reached end rope. Obviously, we’re going put thought that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree longer forestall threshold
 move nontraditional means, better are. indicated yesterday,
 think serious problems move rates down, money market mutual funds
 big issue. ephemeral short-term financial intermediaries come go
 rapidly. trickier questions, questions raised papers
 underlying proposals discussions yesterday. think they, too, minor relative
 risk would take altering basic procedures. Yes, notion
 room move rates may one issues address Humphrey-Hawkins
 testimony without necessarily going far. least knock presumption
 75 basis point limit lot people brought up. think could without
 breaking much crockery, may put way. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. agree recommendation Governor Bernanke’s
 suggestion now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. support recommendation, too. Along Bob Parry Al
 Broaddus, certainly see theory behind getting ahead lower rates inflation
 high output gap trying stem tide economy actually falls deflation.
 personally think reduction 25 basis points advantages. think it’s normal
 way operate environment signs growth. Granted, large
 degree that’s forecast, things looking last time met.
 
 June 24-25, 2003

 view environment, I’m much favor 25 basis points. 25 basis point
 move would also tend moderate bit degree people might believe
 going constrained future actions need take them. believe also
 consistent looking disinflation rather deflation concern right now.
 would agree Governor Bernanke communication we’re operating
 normal still 100 basis points go appropriate. need indicate
 there’s lot stimulus environment signs pickup economic
 activity. way handle situation stage, terms actions
 communicate actions.
 Finally, task force approach communication may good way proceeding.
 also thought, given papers received yesterday, going
 opportunity group discuss communication issues—and maybe even January. find
 extraordinarily complex. discussion somewhat like one yesterday would
 helpful setting basis think issues. want, could
 follow task force look detail come
 recommendations. don’t think immediate, crying need decisions here—at least
 hope don’t. believe there’s time look thoughtfully move forward
 measured way.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. certainly agenda future
 meeting. majority clearly favor 25 basis point reduction retaining, exactly
 similar words, balance risk assessment put May 6 statement. Would
 read appropriate words?
