 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. May make comment? think general Street

 going first rather statesmanlike—especially since didn’t pay anything
 including CAC. Brazilians went next, there’s big question whether less high
 quality borrowers would pay premium CAC. think real answer

 well, positive aspect financial markets. I’m wondering little that. People
 tell reduction credit spreads due fact there’s lot money
 chasing good deals. one looks continuing pace corporate
 downgrades declining volume corporate bond issuance C&I loans, question
 arises whether favorable aspect financial markets may giving
 credit for. I’m wondering credit spreads might widen start narrow again.
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, that’s always possibility. It’s view, however,
 basic health corporate balance sheet improved improved quite noticeably
 last year so. We’ve seen decline default rates. We’ve certainly seen significant
 drop-off interest share cash flow, aided low interest rate environment. Whatever
 cause recent decline spreads, obviously reducing cost capital
 businesses. Now, indicated remarks, businesses don’t reasonable projects
 available decline spreads might provide stimulus investment spending
 we’re anticipating. we’re fairly confident helping reduce cost

 Intermediation taking place, creditworthy borrowers continue fund

 Looking ahead policy discussion, would observe interest rates

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Let begin summarizing broad view. Eleventh District
 showing signs stabilizing modest job growth recently, better
 continued job losses national level. real economy continues soften national
 level, consumer sentiment improved. Spreads narrowed, profits turned up, oil
 prices declined, stock market rebounded. Looking real economy,
 easing seems warranted, timing might bad financial markets
 signaling rebound may coming soon without additional stimulus. Moreover,
 markets expecting easing today, reaction surprise could well
 perverse. Market participants might believe Fed knows something don’t.
 Turning back Eleventh District, economy appears bottomed
 showing early and, hope, sustainable signs expanding sluggish pace. Texas
 experienced positive employment growth last two quarters, better
 nation’s loss jobs, indicated earlier. Job growth 0.7 percent annual rate.
 last two quarters, job gains concentrated construction, financial services, education
 health services government sector. Despite high energy prices
 period, energy sector shedding jobs rapid clip. Though Texas
 positive job growth, unemployment rate risen sharply nearly percentage point
 national rate.
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 42 115
 
 bright spots beginning emerge, though. high-tech industry may finally
 showing signs life. Job losses slowed profitability orders showing
 signs improvement. positive side, drilling natural gas continued register
 gains energy industry confident strong natural gas prices going
 go away soon. bad news side, demand gas outstripping ability bring
 new production, gas prices expected remain well historical norms
 several years. Oil prices expected fall further, energy prices overall fall
 proportionately natural gas oil prices expected decoupled next
 years. Another bright spot comes temporary employment industry area,
 experienced job surge annual rate 12 percent first quarter, contrast
 Michael reported bigger picture. Finally, Beige Book contacts report
 retail, auto, restaurant sales begun revive depressed war
 Iraq.
 negative side, downsizing airline operations continuing,
 employment reductions expected. wage reductions roughly 25 percent airline
 employees experiencing adding deflationary pressures high-tech sector
 District.
 Turning national economy, I’m inclined agree staff forecast
 second half year likely outcome. six months since we’ve lowered
 rates real fed funds rate last rate cut. Monetary policy less
 stimulative, economy probably less sensitive Fed stimulus year
 ago. Although federal government stimulus expected increase near future,
 political process may provide less stimulus we’ve anticipating. delayed clarity
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 43 115
 
 exactly contained fiscal package means spending sensitive
 tax code likely continue deferred. short, may getting lot less stimulus
 monetary fiscal policy think. addition, state local fiscal
 situation reinforces conclusion.
 look downside risks economy, I’m increasingly concerned
 economy underperforming Greenbook forecast. outlook economic growth
 rest world continually revised months end. Also, business
 balance sheets undergone considerable repair, there’s way go balance sheets
 line economic realities last couple years. applies broad swath
 businesses, industries airlines telecom undergoing enormous
 structural adjustments.
 overall see risks forecast lying primarily downside. Given
 low inflation fallen possibility shortfall current economic forecasts, could
 support easing monetary policy meeting. said earlier, financial markets
 signaling better times ahead, easing today could unsettle markets. think waiting
 order. feel risks weighted downside, I’d rather say
 reintroducing bias statement today’s meeting.

 Let turn national scene. broad contours economic forecast
 changed little since last meeting. Like Greenbook, expect modest growth
 second quarter followed rebound trend growth second half greater
 trend growth next year. reasons outlined others Greenbook—monetary

 pick up. context I’m aware recent news, others indicated,
 relatively disappointing. That’s partly reason, understand, taking
 position move insurance. Also, don’t necessarily think
 probabilities deflation high Dave outlined—depending model, one get
 much lower probabilities—the fact matter accelerating inflation near-term

 Well, one answer fiscal policy form increased defense spending tax reduction,

 government spending accounts 12 percent real GDP—almost much business

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. preparation FOMC meeting
 obviously seems appropriate make judgments three different forecasting issues.
 first whether baseline forecast reasonable acceptable. second
 forecast evolved period time, either meetings even going back
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 60 115
 
 little time. third risks around baseline. let tell
 I, least, look three issues.
 first, I’d argue Greenbook baseline forecast may well reasonable.
 Certainly end military phase Iraqi war, financial conditions clearly
 improved, others already indicated. Equity prices rising. Risk spreads
 narrowed somewhat, though still relatively wide historical standards. Reductions
 oil prices, expected, become clearer, we’ve seen improvement consumer
 confidence small uptick corporate profits. developments would argue
 might well consistent basic contours baseline forecast.
 Taking baseline least reasonable outlook stage, second part
 first question is, acceptable? answer resounding “no”! don’t think
 baseline growth outcome sufficient. output gap envisioned baseline persists
 several quarters; closed forecast period. Unemployment rates remain well
 reasonable well-performing U.S. economy. addition, composition
 GDP growth issue. least near term, acceleration GDP growth heavily
 dependent government defense spending, indeed, private demand noticeably weaker
 one would like. Importantly, others mentioned, inflation prospects offered
 baseline concern. context price stability targets recognizing
 uncertainty measurement, also judge inflation outlook verging unattractive.
 point want make slight distinction explain nature concern.
 question mind deflation per se. It’s certainly question going back
 experience ’30s. really much question disinflation,
 troubling number reasons. One reason implications effectiveness
 
 May 6, 2003

 monetary policy. second vulnerability already weak economy additional
 shock might emerge either internal external sources.
 Also, would say price inflation drop even lower currently forecast
 increases possibility think self-fulfilling negative ramifications
 households businesses. I’d argue even baseline reasonable—as believe
 is— don’t think it’s necessarily acceptable vigilant regard.
 second issue one thinks terms forecasts exactly forecast
 evolved. David already pointed prepared remarks, significant
 downward revisions staff’s forecast since March. think Cathy compared
 projections year ago. went back September 2002 Greenbook looked
 one Greenbook forecasts since then. one exception, GDP outlook
 marked time. also marking rate inflation.
 clearly reflects fact data coming weaker weaker every one
 successive periods, least undermine degree confidence one
 might Greenbook forecast.

 triumph hope experience reality.
 
 May 6, 2003

 Let go third question, involves issue risks. would say
 risks sense balanced, think cautious assessment.
 order see upside risks respect baseline forecast, think two things
 emerge soon. One tentative nature various
 conversations many us business people turn quickly revelation
 great deal pent-up demand either business fixed investment inventory. don’t see
 that’s going come structural side investment whatsoever, reasons
 several Presidents already indicated. think President Poole, President Pianalto,
 perhaps someone else raised question whether investment another firm’s excess
 capacity ends positive respect economy whole. it’s possible
 argue upside risk real side economy, would say it’s
 fairly tentative argument.
 think reasons concerned downside risks real
 economy. One conditions accommodative one might think. context

 indeed market expecting little us terms policy action today,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Let add two points discussion. first fiscal policy.
 going key week respect fiscal policy tax writing
 committees House Senate meet week. seems many
 momentum shifted House, part House committee chairman
 exhibited perhaps strongest thought leadership maybe sagacious political
 leadership well. must say he’s also dealing friendly accommodative
 budget restraints.
 Senate probably meet also may make effort cram President’s
 dividend exclusion proposal legislation way within limitations
 budget restraints. seems likely that, instead President’s proposal respect
 dividends, may come cap tax rate dividends drop tax rate
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 64 115
 
 capital gains. Many Congress find palatable dividend exclusion,
 terms ability explain doing. would also clear way
 acceleration previously enacted tax cuts. might note last Wednesday
 Chairman, response questions House Banking Committee, made real effort try
 distinguish tax cuts stimulate capital spending tax cuts stimulate
 consumption. would say don’t see discussion reflected
 deliberations either side.
 trying read political tea leaves, seems people sense White
 House would willing accept tax package number north $350 billion—and
 could north $450 billion, would better. know week
 respect tax policy know today.
 point relates banking industry, interestingly little change
 reported last two meetings. saw throughout 2002 gradual decline
 asset quality, 2003 remained stable. consumer side,
 postwar bounce, part wartime decline significant extent
 consumer area. hearing anecdotally—from members Federal Advisory Council
 meeting last Friday number people—the first hints plans expansion
 indications business people think time might right expand. seems likely
 another area there’s difference data measure
 anecdotal information picking up, ex parte numbers read.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Relative previous meetings,
 considerably discussion inflation disinflation meeting. I’m gratified
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 65 115
 
 think considerations central policy analysis
 point. Let add points discussion.
 Disentangling persistent temporary changes rate inflation difficult,
 measurement issues cloud picture further. Nevertheless, best guess underlying
 inflation declining recently. Comparing year ending March 2003 year
 ending March 2002, Greenbook notes inflation measured core CPI fallen
 2.4 1.7 percent. past six months measure barely 1.0 percent
 annual rate. Inflation measured chain version core CPI fallen
 1.8 percent last year 1.2 percent year. Data past six months available.
 Inflation measured core PCE deflator stable 1.5 percent past two
 years, Greenbook notes stability largely result increases nonmarket
 imputed prices. Excluding nonmarket prices, core PCE inflation fell 1.3 percent year
 ending March 2002 0.9 percent year ending March 2003, averaged 0.2 percent
 past six months. course, given nominal funds rate, disinflation amounts de
 facto tightening monetary policy.
 monetary policy works lag, principle concerned
 forecast future inflation rather past inflation. Forecasting inflation tricky,
 though worth pointing several well-known academic studies found
 Greenbook’s forecasts inflation better made private sector. staff
 estimates core PCE inflation 1.0 percent 2004, owing largely fact
 even growth nearly 4 percent second half year 2004,
 economy would still considerable slack well next year.
 
 May 6, 2003
 
 66 115
 
 course, always upside downside risks staff forecast.
 However, loss function respect inflation forecast error asymmetric.
 1 percentage point undershoot inflation forecast, would bring us brink
 outright deflation, would much costly 1 percentage point overshoot,
 undesirable latter might be. short, first time many decades risks
 inflation objective decidedly downward. Given risks employment also seem
 downward, appears prima facie case easing policy. tend agree
 conclusion, barring exceptionally strong near-term turnaround economy, hope
 Committee adopt posture leaning toward ease.
 would like add important caveat, however. chance hit zero
 bound constraint point, though large, certainly negligible. response
 President Guynn’s earlier remarks, way, believe zero bound constraint policy
 major risk deflationary environment—one could real costs would inhibit
 ability stabilize economy. generally, noted Governors Kohn Ferguson,
 deflation puts floor real interest rate therefore destabilize distort capital
 markets. Theoretically risk zero bound increases urgency preemptive
 easing. However, also seems important plan might proceed
 seamlessly standard rate-cutting nonstandard operations operations
 become necessary. me, along lines suggested President Hoenig,
 argument delaying easing point, it. delay would give Committee
 chance think easing action fits broader strategy may involve—though
 hope not—nonstandard policy operations. Thank you.

 going suggest something slightly different. Let throw table

 MR. SANTOMERO. concur decision support it. like idea
 splitting two sentences. wordsmith, I’d argue “taken together”
 sentence doesn’t need there. Let markets put together indicate
 believe conditions relate sustainable growth inflation. put two
 together, sense trying summarize view risks, we’re giving code
 words market. preference eliminate sentence, go either way.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. support statement. like fact we’ve broken two
 risks explicitly this. could voted reduction funds rate target today
 I’m looking much market moved fed funds futures rates since last
 meeting. market pricing rate cut; it’s matter when.
 side while, I’m inclined believe market would upset
 easing action today. go along recommendation wait see
 future information develops. look forward discussion next meeting. indicated
 earlier, I’d like see us think strategy signals want
 send move lower inflation world haven’t experienced long time.
 think help us improve communication considered carefully
 long-term plan get low inflation period. another plastic surgery
 swan.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Based reading Greenbook options presented
 Bluebook, would supported easing today. persuaded, however, timing
 question support recommendation. would like add one point executive

 sentiment, building comments made Chairman, Vice Chairman McDonough,
 Governor Bies. markets still reward executives outperform peers. look back
 1991-92 environment, significant amount downsizing going on,
 downsizing complete two options available achieve growth—to
 expand merger expand additional investment. seems time
 seen great deal improvement efficiency timing investment decisions, say
 nothing decisions terms investments make. margin
 error timing even tighter 1991-92. coming back Vice Chairman
 McDonough’s comment psychology, psychology seems right businesses
 make new investments, think pickup investment could quite rapid. view
 anything point disturb would wrong.
 respect statement, eighteen months ago first joined Committee
 thought would pretty easy improve statements making. didn’t take
 long realize every change made parsed carefully, second meeting
 conscious desirability changing words necessary. However,
 business world, windows opportunity. opined risk assessment
 last meeting gives us opportunity time make changes, changes seem
 appropriate. support statement also manner we’ve
 altered statement.

 would point may decapitate swan point. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s called oranges sausages.
 MR. FERGUSON. could always vote loss function.
 MR. BERNANKE. People suggested that, Governor Ferguson.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think good case could made easing
 policy today. likely scenario economy next year leaves
 significant excess capacity place. low inflation economy weakened state,
 believe erring side ease likely would entail little cost whereas erring
 side inaction could significantly costly. cost inaction could especially
 large within range deflation zero bound. Finally, believe
 preemptive served us well past. Quite frankly, recollection correct, times
 acting preemptive manner involved surprising markets, don’t think we’ve
 suffered result that.
 also would say third paragraph helpful me. Let make comments.
 never thought talked upside downside risks terms
 commenting sustainable growth. always meant risks forecast growth—
 saw either upside downside risks projection growth, sustainable
 growth, think different concept. Also last two sentences help bit

 point clearly issues think ought focused on, particularly
 we’re still interested acting preemptive way. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, think decision policy today close call.
 could easily supported easing today. said earlier remarks, think
 fairly dramatic improvement financial sector offers us enough promise it’s worthwhile
 wait see bit longer. bias statement, I’ve long-time skeptic
 benefits bias statement. regard, think Roger generous
 accepting sole paternity! since agrees it’s prettiest baby he’s ever seen, seems
 we’re missing good opportunity, put it, bury whole concept

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. supportive policy recommendation, support
 unbundling two risks. I’m also pleased statement acknowledges concern
 deflation indicating substantial fall inflation would unwelcome. However, share
 views expressed others “taken together” sentence, rebundles
 risks. concerned cause markets focus fact we’ve changed
 balance risks toward weakness. preference sentence
 statement. However, support statement it’s written. I, too, look forward

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.

 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation make policy change
 today. actually came thinking—and said somebody break—that worst
 worlds would take action today go back balance risk statement
 kind ended here. think Al Broaddus maybe Kohn made point
 quite vivid mind—that need convey positive sense outlook.
 throw bit cold water way statement structured I, like several others—I’m
 still thinking speak—believe might better strike last sentence
 blend two risks. know can’t abandon statement without preparing public
 it. I’m smart enough don’t enough time think whether
 simply drop sentence. I’m afraid undo we’re trying today,
 bothers good deal.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, could associate preference
 eliminating sentence?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. general willingness desire that?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. don’t share view because, take
 sentence, effect divorce previous form statement

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, think would mistake pull out.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. it’s consensus—. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, definitely agree policy

 MR. FERGUSON. were?
 MR. MOSKOW. certainly was, along Bob Parry Bill McDonough.
 MR. PARRY. it’s baby! [Laughter]
 MR. MOSKOW. think language obsolete now. There’s question needs
 changed. need eliminate wording risks. would preferred

 subcommittee appointed come back Committee

 Second, think elevates concern disinflation significantly. preference would
 be—and mind option would least risk influencing markets—to go back

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s difficult make judgment. Basically,
 sole purpose exactly market expects, find one-half
 primary dealers responded recent survey expected FOMC adopt neutral
 statement. half evenly divided expecting assessment tilted
 toward weakness expecting continued deferral assessment. So, views
 same. think we’re running people commented.
 MR. GUYNN. postscript allowable, Mr. Chairman? rebut, want
 make point seems enough uneasiness hybrid statement I’m
 uncomfortable Vincent’s notion might wait next January talk
 this. wonder can’t find way get back fundamental discussion wording
 press statements suspect issue we’re struggling us
 while. We’re going problem meeting meeting don’t tackle June
 least fairly quickly. would lobby quick attention it.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, agree that. would like associate
 President Moskow’s thoughts appointing subcommittee rather waiting get
 staff memos forth January. Put group together sooner rather later, let’s get
 it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seems reasonable. Would read appropriate
