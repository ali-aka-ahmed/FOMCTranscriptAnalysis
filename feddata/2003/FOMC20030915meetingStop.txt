 Committee’s procedures rather tomorrow’s meeting policy choice.
 Since February 4, 1994, Committee’s discussion communications
 private sector centered announcements actions. I’d note first
 releases explicitly billed statements Chairman explaining
 Committee’s action. mid-1994, though, distinction disappeared.

 First, process respect important role discussion meeting.
 circulate single prospective draft announcement several proposed alternatives
 isolate limited number current features economy members

 might stifle discussion. time, hard imagine nineteen
 people around Committee table could constructively edit draft release

 Part worry, second point, Committee seemed
 want complicate forging consensus policy action. words

 third observation might want take opportunity

 settle stripped-down announcement hard compromise
 anything specific might represent admission Committee unable
 use potentially important instrument disposal.
 Fourth, Committee surely wants avoid mistakes. experience,
 drafting press release shares similarity juggling chainsaws,
 mostly spend time worrying go wrong counting
 digits you’re done. less time greater number last-minute
 changes, likely mistakes.
 Fifth, almost goes without saying, everyone want preserve
 confidentiality Committee’s decision release. would raised

 try keep things simple could, basic data used federal
 funds futures market. I’ve plotted daily quote business day closest fifteenth
 last month quarter contemporaneous forecast futures market indicated
 trading contract three months ahead. March 15, let’s say,
 contract March current, actual, rate. there’s futures rate March 15
 June contract. Okay? red dots show market anticipating threemonth-ahead horizon. black line shows I’m calling actual change. It’s
 difference current month’s contract—let’s say March contract quoted
 March 15—and June contract quoted June 15.
 fairly clear time market predicts rate change

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m surprised correlation good is.
 MR. POOLE. It’s three-month horizon.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. understand that, actually would expected
 wider scattering chart shows.
 MR. POOLE. think reason scatter narrow reflects fact
 lot observations much going market doesn’t expect much, any,
 changing. first part 1997 period, rate stayed narrow band
 while. Obviously, 1991-92 period quite different, 1994, although market
 anticipated rate changes ’94 FOMC started move funds rate. fact,
 rate changes outran market anticipated fair amount. Remember,
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 21 78
 
 charted changes. last year so, market expected us change rate
 much, although couple occasions good bit market
 anticipated.
 read Dave Lindsey’s history FOMC communications, struck
 historical experience going well back. Dave covered long period,
 began issue policy statement; hints future direction policy given
 times—primarily Chairman speeches testimony. instances FOMC got
 tangled setting expectations marketplace future
 policy moves likely be. biggest difficulties expectations
 realized tended put Committee box sense
 made sort commitment circumstances changed following didn’t
 seem wisest thing do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody jump discussion. I’ll give
 initial response President Poole’s observations. think you’re describing way markets
 work raising question whether information helps markets. Let give example
 something dissimilar markets we’re dealing with, namely long-term crude oil
 futures markets. futures markets interesting sense largely anchored
 long-term equilibrium price crude oil six seven years out. price essentially
 reflects conventional knowledge technology time long would take
 bring new sources oil market. example, markets currently saying
 equilibrium price $23 barrel thereabouts. done, look futures
 markets, contracts anchored $20, $21, $22 area.
 consequence, irrespective short-term price, those—especially small, independent
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 22 78
 
 drillers—who make judgments whether fact drill. take long
 time drill, essentially sell forward market whatever amount oil think
 get. futures price facilitates decisionmaking involved particular time.
 one thing crude oil futures markets awful forecasters.
 find project market poorly sorts events affect market occur
 interim. mean value functioning crude oil market?
 would say contrary. actually affect future; essentially distribute demand
 supply spot markets future—even though forecasting capability
 poor and, indeed, far less accurate predictive capability fed funds futures
 market depicted chart.
 think value, even incremental, communicating manner
 markets understand thinking. mentioned 1997 period fact
 nothing happened respect funds rate then. Well, fact nothing happened
 important. basically say economy going dull next several months
 federal funds rate likely change profoundly important statement
 believe it. say something going change involves much risk saying
 change ability look make judgment limited. may
 consider data indicate poor correlation. think fact quadrants correct
 essentially communicating information market previously.
 regard, think service market endeavoring communicate—as poorly
 it—the general expectation balance risks among Committee members.
 MR. POOLE. regard anchoring expectations, absolutely agree respect
 long-term inflation rate. think anchoring expectations critically important.
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 23 78
 
 you’ve yet convince anchoring expectations number basis points federal
 funds rate going move period relatively months constructive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, instructive, correlation would
 random distribution would negative. Remember, it’s negative.
 MR. POOLE. No, don’t draw conclusion even didn’t say anything
 probable direction federal funds rate, market would understanding
 economy likely evolve. example, there’s lot persistence real GDP
 employment changes. market understanding probabilities
 economy going go and, therefore, interest rates going go. And, course,
 that’s built term structure interest rates moment time. also
 extensive volume literature—and Governor Bernanke help this—on exactly
 expectations model term structure interest rates works. Clearly, term
 structure reflects market expectations rates going go. true
 1994 would independent anything might said that. I’m
 concerned want expectations respond incoming information
 accurately possible.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree said. Take given
 availability factual information economy ongoing phenomenon
 market responding fairly sophisticated way. question is, superimpose
 view outlook, harm, irrelevant, good? order
 determine would create sort scatter diagram. data points wrong
 quadrants, certainly stop we’re harm. wholly random
 distribution, I’d say we’re harm we’re good, we’re wasting

 time. I’m submitting evidence you’re adducing evening strikes confirmation
 that, may adding great deal, adding something. positive
 correlation, seems reasonably certain enough observations
 correlation significantly different zero. correct?
 MR. POOLE. Yes, course.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. take evidence making contribution

 evidence already built make statement. grant part what’s
 built expectation statement be, strike
 indication harm. conservative judging this, would
 say evidence suggest harm marketplace
 consequence actions.
 MR. POOLE. would say providing guidance thinking direction

 providing guidance likely level federal funds rate next meeting one
 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, hope we‘re trying that. would agree
 that. trying communicate we’re going next
 meeting; believe action needs taken, might well now.
 MR. POOLE. I’m trying sharpen distinction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. that’s conclusion you’re reaching, I’m side
 argument.

 MR. BERNANKE. also agree that, Bill. technical distinction you’re

 big question releasing minutes early announcing policy decision
 without commentary, thinking lot, believe market would view
 major step backward transparency. That’s because, that, we’d announce
 day meeting decided would gap of, let’s say, two
 weeks issued minutes. would happen two weeks? Right
 blackout period goes end first week meeting. Would
 extend blackout period another week give speeches time?
 information us, market participants would look speeches very, carefully.
 think announcing decision releasing minutes earlier could lead lot

 Actually, sense conversation, see it, seem going
 direction Vincent’s option 4 table. involves putting language Bluebook
 matches exactly wording would voting meeting, certainly agree with.
 think current Bluebook already takes useful steps direction,
 helpful preparation tomorrow’s meeting. Also standardizing language risk
 assessment is, Roger phrased it, good direction go in. However, would look
 carefully language. think make changes language we’re
 using stress-test language whole series different economic

 view, would useful exercise us.
 Let mention problems language thinking
 carefully. First, there’s point economic growth. way Bluebook worded
 says, “. . . Committee believes risks outlook sustainable economic growth
 next quarters weighted toward downside, balanced, weighted toward
 upside.” would serious concerns saying “weighted toward upside”
 regard sustainable economic growth. ought explain type situation much
 useful way, think ways that. don’t particularly like phrase
 “weighted toward upside.” get situation—sometime future, hope—
 would call risk assessment sort, I’d like find better wording. Also,
 talk risk assessment say, “against background long-term goals
 price stability sustainable economic growth,” describe risks sustainable
 economic growth. don’t use words “price stability”; shift term

 “inflation.” think carefully that—whether really want talk risks
 price stability opposed risks outlook inflation. think that’s question
 discuss group.
 part option 4 that, substantive change contemplated,
 would communicated Committee meeting would time
 think it. think that’s line conversation wording
 Bluebook, agree strongly. process standpoint, much
 better Committee terms operations.
 final point would make term “foreseeable future.” actually define
 specifically year 2000. said although “foreseeable future” “intended
 cover interval extending beyond next FOMC meeting,” concept necessarily
 elastic. [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. could clearer!
 MR. MOSKOW. clearly refers elastic period goes beyond next FOMC

 release time people longer interested them. seems
 accurate representation discussed meeting, ought try get
 they’re still relevant. view would better job providing
 description conveying nuances going meeting anything else
 could do. would urge anything strongly, would earlier release
 minutes. personally believe whatever added resources would take accomplish
 would probably well worth it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May interrupt one second?
 MR. STERN. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s interesting point, need factual
 information. event move minutes up, concern expressed here—
 think Jack raised issue—is start edit minutes now.
 May ask show hands this? would probably editing
 currently do, would please raise hand? would
 amount? presume nobody would less! [Secretary’s note: expressed opinion
 equally divided whether would probably edit minutes intensively
 change current practices. Several members expressed opinion.]
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 54 78
 
 Now, saw people’s current intentions. interesting
 question because, Jack right, could difficult produce minutes quickly.
 hadn’t thought that. always struck moving forward publication
 minutes strictly staff resource question. earlier release date indeed makes
 difficult us produce minutes—not physically them, getting members
 agree content minutes especially accurately reflect meeting’s
 discussion—then think real problem.
 MR. STERN. could be. Jack right, won’t take fishing again!
 [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Continue.
 MR. STERN. couple concerns, one Michael expressed.
 don’t know means say “the risks economic growth weighted toward upside.”
 Presumably mean higher growth could lead higher inflation. ought
 captured inflation statement. Now, maybe meaning intended. so,
 must say it’s obvious would be. stay language
 here, sooner later it’s going come back haunt us. I’m concerned
 connotation word “risks.”
 final thought response one questions Vincent raised: sum
 risks inflation price stability risks real outlook? I’m little
 uncomfortable that. We’ve it, don’t think caused serious
 problems yet. Ned others raised concerns previous
 meetings, logically I’m sure best possible approaches.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree that. Eventually, we’ll run trouble
 issues. moment, though. We’re okay basic point

 MR. STERN. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m glad called
 because, longer meeting goes, balls air we’re going
 unstable equilibrium! First off, process I’m status quo man. think system
 pretty good. fix up, guess puts somewhere
 alternatives 4 5. would like leave minutes alone. one suggestion I’ve heard
 think could improve process put statement Bluebook. think that’s
 good idea. could done without cost, ought start soon possible.
 Indeed, already done meeting.

 statement itself, view “considerable period” sentence special addition
 appropriate conditions time. Although general ought fairly
 formulaic approach statement, time time statements like useful. hope
 don’t put position could never them. know we’re going
 take sentence point—presumably fairly soon—and we’ll deal
 that. thought statement work. basically favor fairly
 formulaic this, think every something less
 standardized.
 “sustainable economic growth” sentence, may interpretation
 economic growth create imbalances, that’s sentence reads way
 it’s written. says, “The Committee perceives upside downside risks
 attainment sustainable growth next quarters roughly equal.” It’s entirely
 speed limits size output gap. may think sentence means
 something else, isn’t sentence says; think better. I’d
 convert output gap type sentence.
 I’ll make one comment, inflation targeting. raises
 whole new set issues, think shouldn’t talk maybe meeting
 January. raise one issue here, however, I’m sure it’s us
 announce inflation target—even soft range—on own. think might well go
 Congress that. make shudder but, hand, may
 interpreting charter little aggressively set inflation target. see
 clear target range could help us, raises huge new set complications,
 think really put subject off. Thank you.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Put category also members don’t think need
 make major change. Like lot people, I’ve spent good deal time thinking
 might done differently past communication. I’ve thought
 recent communication, seemed March/May/June time frame went
 succession two-part statements one-part statement finally three-part
 statement. remember clearly one themes running May meeting
 didn’t want surprise market. happened exactly opposite—the market
 surprised us. feel Steve McQueen movie! may remember one
 started chased cleverly found chaser. seemed
 bind June meeting following dictum—if
 acted way would pleased market—it would run contrary
 policy views people room. seemed found perfect storm.
 time talking possible need use unconventional operational
 means made major changes statement. time also economy
 beginning respond stimulus marketplace. think situation
 much anomaly, view overreact manner
 communication received.
 Keeping theme—and recognizing January we’re going continue
 discussing topic—I would hope make major changes
 next time talk communication issues. want make sure continue
 incrementalists subject. terms part deliberation looking
 alternative methods communicating, would tend support option 4.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree President Hoenig President
 Poole well it’s difficult us talk future. actually I’m fairly
 comfortable we’ve gotten. terms balance risks sentence, view
 useful get three-part assessment. think gave important information
 market said concerned inflation falling low, believe
 helped market interpret actions predict actions better. terms
 President Poole’s chart, looks problems occurred
 making post-meeting announcements. real misses ’91 ’92, started
 issuing statements. don’t see deterioration predictability federal funds rate
 since started announcing tilts assessment balance risks. markets
 pretty much gotten direction right. think fairly satisfied results depicted
 chart period since started announcing. don’t think supports notion
 providing balance risks tilt hasn’t useful. don’t see chart all.
 think summing part statement useful. I’ve said before, it’s part
 risk-management type strategy you’ve talked about, Mr. Chairman. third
 sentence give us opportunity tell market we’re implementing strategy
 we’re worried foreseeable future—that elastic concept.
 “considerable period” sentence different matter. make semicommitment policy future period time, uncomfortable getting
 that. comfortable point thought was, effect, kind
 nontraditional policy. funds rate 1 percent. People worried
 disinflation, important, particularly low interest rate, markets
 
 September 15, 2003

 understand little better doing. share everyone else’s concern that, going
 forward, predicting time dimension regard policy actions part
 regular process. don’t think needs be. part unusual situation.
 agree dialogue President Parry, Mr. Chairman, regarding
 balance risks statement. believe formulaic, think Vince’s suggestion
 putting Bluebook helpful. also agree President Moskow need
 clarify language. happen disagree statements “sustainable
 growth” means. think changes output gap, President Parry wanted,
 even though wasn’t interpreting actual statement way. completely agree
 need start figuring mean language make clear rest
 world make clear ourselves. [Laughter] That’s something needs happen
 sooner rather later. issues could come back haunt us many meetings go
 by, think need work January meeting. think I’ll stop there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, I’ve always thought sustaining meant selfsustaining—in words, situation gears working perpetual motion.
 That’s closer “imbalances” interpretation, would suspect. never thought
 terms two alternatives gentlemen mentioned. always thought meant selfsustaining.
 MR. KOHN. proves point needing clarify it!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m little puzzled it.
 MS. MINEHAN. It’s market doesn’t know mean! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. English language wonderfully elastic. President
 Poole.

 MR. POOLE. point don’t think come yet fact we’re talking
 number different audiences. regard political accountability—talking
 Congress general public—I think fine, believe current publication
 schedule minutes fully serves audience. terms talking markets, Cathy
 Jamie mentioned traders, I’d certainly like draw distinction traders
 portfolio managers. traders make money reading tea leaves, hot tips,
 understanding little nuances. really want know thinking
 federal funds rate next meeting possibility intermeeting changes rate.
 don’t much care underlying reasons.
 speak point Gary talked about, moving release minutes,
 think argument we’d really speaking traders trying
 divine going next meeting. care policy action rather
 underlying rationale policy. actually think there’s real advantage
 separating minutes, well logistic issues we’ve talked about,
 specific meeting apply. allows minutes interpreted
 care trying understand reasons underlying policy action
 took particular meeting forecast action we’re going take next.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s interesting point.
 MR. POOLE. would also emphasize we’ve used words “formulaic”
 “boilerplate” discussion. words negative connotations, obviously.
 we’re talking standard language standard meaning. want sure
 don’t convey negative connotations. think that’s quite important.
 
 September 15, 2003

 view, separating balance risks inflation part growth part
 important, agree Mike really need stress-test language. think we’re
 going problem point saying real growth high unemployment
 rate low. make sure know we’re going get
 point we’re concerned undue pressures resources—or however want phrase
 it.
 lot misgivings third sentence. forget exact terminology,
 use words “on balance,” think market reads simply hint
 we’re going next meeting. would like take out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Let make couple comments. points
 covered, want highlight ones hit rather hard thought them. First,
 think happened regard communications last couple
 months, think part problem uncharted waters. hadn’t
 inflation rates low. hadn’t wars possibility war intervening
 economic process time. sat around table, lot Knightian
 uncertainty. heard today, one learn. people learned Fed
 likely do, market adapted. Whatever come communication policy, think
 realize times like we’ve we’re probably going get
 box we’ve put into. times demand different type communication.
 market sees things aren’t normal, may need use something
 standard type communication.
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 62 78
 
 become uncomfortable moving direction giving forecast,
 point also made. really think need talk
 moment come decision—that’s important point—without going
 kind commitment sense term. reason, think move
 publication minutes. reason come conclusion relates Cathy
 talked about, us go give speeches meetings. market
 observers do? read words people around table happen give speeches
 economy try divine Committee whole thinking.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. speeches scheduled three months advance.
 MS. BIES. market’s interpretation based words selected number
 around table happen speaking engagements talk economic
 situation. minutes give better representation diversity views well
 consensus lay different views felt way did. think
 minutes released market getting full representation got
 consensus dominant consensus may been. would prefer moving
 minutes. also agree comments made language. would
 like see us move standard wording. also would like us think hard putting
 plain English. words, economic growth, say, indicate see accelerating
 still see large gap unused resources economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sounds like forecast me.
 MS. BIES. Well, it’s see today. reflects got conclusion
 regarding policy. I’d prefer that, rather say risks risks down—
 think read many different ways depending economy happens
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 63 78
 
 be. It’s first difference inflation growth rates, inflation 1 percent
 going inflation 1 percent going disinflation, we’d get different reactions.
 think standard words, need consider different sides. wording
 plain English, might take care last sentence capacity issues
 developments see economy would tied together. Maybe would get us
 awkward final sentence. still trouble last sentence.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let get clarification. clarifying language
 use straight declarative sentences, think we’d making statements think
 going happen see risk.
 MS. BIES. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. impression is, may mistaken this,
 act writing declarative sentences forces take position stipulating something
 quite specific. Falling back probabilistic Bayesian type language seems fuzzying
 statements, that’s exactly we’re trying create sense
 probabilities certainties. don’t think there’s question clear language superior
 Bayesian language, clear without inadvertently making forecast?
 MS. BIES. Well, it’s going difficult. lesson took last
 months using standard risk-assessment language times like this, we’re going
 turn direction economy, sends confusing signals.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let make request. Take last statement
 one we’re going use tomorrow rewrite them. Take look I’m curious
 would it.
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 64 78
 
 MS. BIES. Well, that’s agreed suggestion made earlier
 trying test proposed language different circumstances.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s exactly reason ask.
 MS. BIES. Yes, think that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Take shot see come with.
 MS. BIES. Okay. main comments had.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, I’ve always confused Bayesian things
 seems people still try figure probability something happening
 already happened, trouble with! [Laughter] Since many probably
 would like see Dallas Cowboys get beaten tonight, I’ll brief. I’m Cathy
 Jamie, basically said didn’t think major problem certainly
 one worth throwing baby bath water. view, misunderstandings—
 especially big ones—about trying communicate rare. Frankly, recent one
 first recall. market may learn may learn it,
 market may come conclusion ten pinks red make. problem may
 surface anytime soon.
 know position last couple years, going make
 changes communication practices, would favor letting policy decisions speak
 themselves. Market participants observers understand context
 circumstances we’re make decisions. don’t think lot explanation
 took particular action necessary. keep things simple possible
 moving parts possible. Ideally, would like vote bias.
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 65 78
 
 would report it, would one less thing get wrong. that’s
 movement away transparency, think offset moving release
 minutes earlier date.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. offer comment several
 hours ago Mr. Parry spoke, I’m rather glad didn’t point would
 said Vincent laid impossible task us. far could tell,
 asking us figure communicate, fashion
 communicate, change current communications. figured would take
 days least hours had. However, seem come fairly close
 convergence number interesting think valuable points. let throw
 views them.
 First all, think Parry contribution say let’s try get simple
 standardized let’s make work. think that’s right approach. move away
 term “boilerplate” even term “standard,” we’ll still problem explaining
 exactly mean words use think attach subtle nuances them.
 don’t think make statements clear need allow unexpected
 events go forward. terms assessment, think keep simple. I,
 too, problem balance statement. individual elements think
 need wordsmithing. I’m sure words we’re using exactly right, whether
 we’re talking sustainable growth price stability. view, making assessment
 balance two risks involves trying add things virtually impossible
 add up. tell people that, net, here’s want really
 
 September 15, 2003

 risks balanced add up. think part statement needs work
 going forward.
 terms whether need change word “risk” “odds”
 thing, thesaurus works Word Perfect programs. change “odds,” we’ll put
 “odds,” we’ll circle it, we’ll say it’s Fed-speak risks. think
 recognize recent experience involved unusual circumstance, notably environment
 lot changing. People unclear saying part
 dynamic changes markets time trying say it.
 would quite cautious deal minutes moving
 release. view questions whether want four-week blackout period
 we’re waiting minutes come whether working
 minutes real time. tricky issues, think cautious moving
 direction there.
 got middle fourth subject, inflation targeting, wasn’t even
 list. I’d happy talk that, nearly everyone wants see Dallas
 Cowboys get beat up! I’m going forgo comments moment say
 think come long way toward convergence views issues.
 comments thus far suggest need take subtle steps make massive changes.
 gets us something like option number 4 4½, think that’s reasonable place be.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like support Washington
 consensus, option number 4. Broadly speaking, think form statement rather good.
 particular think breaking output inflation risks useful step,
 
 September 15, 2003

 although fine-tuning there. agree process
 improvement via Bluebook get everyone’s input bit earlier get information
 little earlier.
 I’m responsible anyone confusion phrase “considerable period,”
 let say word that. Governor Kohn put exactly right, think. words
 “considerable period” part nonstandard monetary policy. get close
 zero bound, run traditional tools, way influence interest rates
 manipulating expectations. it’s very, nonstandard unusual way address
 monetary policy. certainly mind advocating approach.
 We’re now, hope—and seems case—no longer great risk deflation zero
 bound. certainly hope that’s case. imagine reference kinds
 considerations disappear statement. let warn that, reach
 zero bound again, would well advised consider using statements sort
 may become tool, auxiliary tool.
 Let say something minutes. don’t think President Guynn’s comment
 minutes taking undue importance context eliminating press statement.
 think would keep statement central means communication. moving
 minutes would fact useful document does, President Moskow suggested,
 contain lot useful information. would require kind additional blackout
 period. One argument made moving minutes release
 would create unnecessary market impact. experience is—and think correct view
 —that market effects Fed actions, speeches, less continuous.
 There’s singular impact. count one thinks moving minutes would
 
 September 15, 2003

 relatively effective easy way increase transparency provide
 information market. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. last two meetings even
 reading transcripts last two meetings, spent lot time talking
 need improve communications, expected supporting major changes way
 communicate. getting material Vincent also reading Dave Lindsey’s
 paper, found camp wanting make minor changes we’re
 currently. believe statement announces action gives
 reasons action. think continue language balance risks,
 improvements recommended Presidents Stern
 Moskow. noted reading minutes August meeting language
 action clearer statement, brought mind comment Governor
 Bies maybe could clearer language. wording minutes still
 risk information it, statement little clearer me. think suggestions
 made providing draft language advance Bluebook
 tying language press release help make statements clearer.
 also agree several colleagues, however, stop short hinting
 future policy refrain either deliberately inadvertently signaling markets
 next move likely be. would want us stop short trying manage
 expectations future policy actions.
 Finally, regard minutes, came thinking good idea release
 minutes earlier. listening comments tonight, especially concern
 
 September 15, 2003
 
 69 78
 
 could readily reverse decision return current practice, think issue
 requires little thought make move. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, thank much. We’ve gone around table,
 must say impression substantive issues put table
 expected and, indeed, potentially conclusions. think it’s fairly evident
 generally two schools emerging. One de minimis alternative,
 gather without objection, making language directive conform exactly
 language statement. something everyone could acquiesce to, would
 strike way solve one immediate problem. thank President San
 Francisco Bank.
 Also, believe covered issue relationship statement
 minutes productive manner—identifying possible tradeoffs alternatives
 like. Finally, issue raised side table stress-testing
 important one. Tomorrow continuity previous
 meetings. agree point Mike Moskow raised—that begin
 observe economy starting heat up, language isn’t going work.
 sure, communication agenda topic scheduled January meeting, say
 that’s late. think ought ask staff indeed stress-test language—
 tomorrow’s meeting meeting thereafter—so we’ll get knowledge
 alternatives might exit current situation various scenarios. never
 thought term “stress-test,” certain analogy we’re looking here,
 think actually works.

 conjunction that, ought mentioned Susan, example. hope
 find words probabilistic character—which always
 confusing average person—and yet avoid forecast. That’s going tricky problem,
 I’m sure resolvable. view—and turn outs I’m wrong, that’s
 better—is can’t get away probabilistic language indeed that’s
 kind world live. Trying make deterministic world Bayesian world
 isn’t doable.
 Therefore, think ought implement soon proposal get

 quickly possible, try formulate actual phraseologies might use
 economic conditions evolve event certain developments marketplace. We’re
 presuming given, possibility error, long output gap stays open
 rate inflation fall. Well, I’ve said many you, remember well people held
 view even strongly late 1960s; years later
 realized wrong, nobody could explain possible inflation rising
 large gap remaining. Indeed, stagflation something conceivable

 recognize that, firmly believe understand way economy growing,
