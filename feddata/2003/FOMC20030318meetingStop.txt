 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Incidentally, I’ve always presumed GSEs could
 essentially construct whatever duration gap wanted issue cost
 it. Since Freddie tends much narrower gap Fannie, correct presume
 willing pay insurance premium create gap whereas Fannie not?
 MR. KOS. Yes, think that’s good interpretation, believe that’s analysis
 market made. Interestingly though, one would thought,
 case, Freddie would rewarded higher PE equities, one doesn’t see that.
 One could argue prudent protecting risk little better,
 showing way investors assessing equities.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, aren’t factors determine size

 say it’s probably price expectations demand liquidity, obviously it’s
 difficult issue parse.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. see spread synthetic
 benchmark ten-year issues going significantly, suggests liquidity improving.
 MR. KOS. Yes, that’s interesting point, I’ve asked that. One explanation

 MR. BERNANKE. don’t survey data information long-term

 MS. JOHNSON. No, nothing would go far enough answer question.
 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you.
 MR. KOS. interesting one sense, though, curve pulled down.
 Interest rates lower, spreads come in; yet economy really seem

 much evidence weakness goes beyond Iraq. Although contacts

 concerned people markets didn’t hear discussion may

 uncertainties produce problems we’re trying solve. That’s one concern have.
 second concern relates issue heightened surveillance. think markets
 understand we’re always job. Therefore, concern people may look
 think we’re likely something response event fact event falls short
