 something like result likely? course, it’s accompanied well trend growth

 MR. STOCKTON. think rubber meets road. fact,
 following models quite closely here, underlying assumption structural labor

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, Tenth District economy continues improve,

 Overall, expect growth end next year 4 percent, little better

 Greenbook explicitly, appreciate putting there. case, it’s obviously
 encouraging projection, we’ve noted already discussion.
 it’s important note that, third quarter, firms met stepped-up demand
 continued high productivity growth actually slightly lower aggregate hours worked

 one might call employment gap actually widened since aggregate hours need

 there’s tension divergence, whatever right word is, narrowing output gap
 widening employment gap third quarter that’s going resolved one way
 another.
 I’m really looking we’ve talking little different way.
 Greenbook resolves divergence assuming recent exceptionally high productivity
 growth reflects extraordinary reluctance firms hire rehire workers. Greenbook
 projection assumes factor starts abate next year productivity growth slowing
 dramatically firms begin hire aggressively meet rising demands. Demand grows

 there’s alternative resolution that’s worth considering, guess one

 things: (1) assess economy risks outlook, (2) decide policy implications,

 one hopes—I’ll try brief first two.
 assessment economy, it’s clear third fourth quarters seem
 extremely robust. One recognizes obviously, Ned Gramlich mentioned, pattern
 particularly respect real PCE growth slow little September. doesn’t
 leave great concern. think overall pattern PCE growth still well

 fourth quarters likely robust. Fortunately, also appears sources
 turnaround seem broadening somewhat. industrial sector starting show
 signs strength. Industrial production appears expanded third quarter, it’s
 possible capacity utilization also starting firm somewhat. I’d say labor market,
 biggest question mark we’ve dealing with, seem giving early
 signs stabilizing. haven’t talked much room today September
 jobs data came out, got quite bit attention press, shouldn’t forget
 news positive. Similarly, revisions job declines July August
 right direction consistent gradual bottoming labor market. four-week

 leads second issue, one assesses future. regard
 understand generally feel reasonably comfortable logic Greenbook forecast.
 Greenbook assumes step-up productivity continue, though hasn’t taken
 increases recently permanent. stimulative policies plus assumptions
 multiplier accelerator effects result economy grows 5 percent per year,
 creates jobs wealth, unemployment rate falling gradually. President
 Broaddus said, Greenbook forecast certainly easy love. Dallas

 Let talk risks associated forecast. think it’s easy see
 risks downside, Cathy pointed out. One risks much

 certainly worried it. seem think may really sign slower growth
 Greenbook forecast suggests. recently meeting real estate roundtable,
 across board group quite subdued. anecdotal information suggests
 staff forecast bit hopeful many people, least many real world,
 stage. Add fact Greenbook forecast already Blue Chip
 consensus, seems concern downside risks warranted.
 upside, though, think one must say rarely stage expansion
 economy seen kind fiscal monetary stimulus—with interest rates extremely low,
 
 October 28, 2003

 prices stable, dollar coming off, productivity increasing, financial conditions turning,

 potential around forecast. I’d say even around relatively optimistic forecast,
 love may fleeting, risks relatively balanced.

 interesting contrast results used forward-looking rule.
 particular, forward-looking Taylor rule implies much slower tightening process. Indeed
 according projection, funds rate reach 1.50 percent end 2004 rather

 Greenbook forecast horizon doesn’t permit projection 2005, though, couldn’t

 forward-looking rule puts high weight inflation expectations, course, using
 Greenbook forecast low inflation rate expected forecast period.
 that’s mechanical reason.

 Second, come background consulting, one first things learned

 Fed “too secretive”; surprising 5 percent said Fed provided much

 wrongly—put wording together. worked well far I’m concerned.
 special circumstances came up, made changes wording. served
 purpose fallout that. ought go back earlier language
 starting point—not language we’re using, put together ad hoc piece-bypiece, back base. Let’s think see need modify
 language. makes sense, I’d keep structure close earlier version possible
 move forward. would try figure wording today choose among several
 options. don’t feel comfortable them. I’d feel reasonably comfortable

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.

 MR. FERGUSON. think that’s true.
 MR. POOLE. I’m uncomfortable view policy

 That’s believe providing hints causes problems helps. I’m
 saying that’s something need discuss.
 MR. FERGUSON. Right.

 get comfortable that. I’ve spent lot time career arguing price

 target—or let say firmer inflation anchor—I could comfortable something
 like Ned’s proposed language. think could work. That’s alternatives
 us.
 agree Jack Tom need think carefully. need take

 satisfactory then. point would add that, make decision,

 we’ve made changes past. may want release extended press statement

 That’s am.

 we’re going say make something different. markets going

 Governor Gramlich’s wording appeals me. Also, suspect Federal Reserve Act

 think make lot changes. That’s component Gramlich memo
 find particularly appealing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. goes far beyond said.
 MR. OLSON. he?

 105 126
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. specific numbers. voted instructions
 Federal Reserve Bank New York used exactly kind language you’re
 talking about. fact happens issue agree. use sort
 language. think Ned trying get something specific that. He’s trying
 put hard numbers get something conclusive vague notion maximum
 sustainable growth. agreed number was, could it. that’s
 going happen.
 MR. OLSON. guess didn’t read way.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ned, misinterpreting said?
 MR. GRAMLICH. think so.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, tell I’ve said wrong.
 MR. GRAMLICH. don’t see anything commits us specific goal
 either inflation side unemployment side. actually replaces statement

 could avoid giving specific numerical targets.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, question whether fact real world

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, withdraw negative comment. President
 Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. I’ll make different negative comment then, Mr. Chairman.
 concerned maximum sustainable employment objective. don’t really mean
 it’s objective—obviously agree it’s statute—but would put
 statement. find difficult envision circumstance would ever want say
 publicly economic growth proceed next quarters rate
 consistent attainment maximum sustainable employment latter falling short

 puts us awkward position, quite frankly. think term “growth” served us well

 Theoretically, judgment, earlier publication minutes ideal solution

 MR. PARRY. address issue whether would get kind
 product now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, that’s correct. That’s issue. Nevertheless,
 minutes bad now. think describe conceptually doing.
 MR. REINHART. Mr. Chairman, answer President Moskow’s question, would
 make one observation. Bank England model approach, get
 minutes two weeks. also advantage everybody policy group
 building, sit devote half-day editing minutes line line.
 original assumption regard January discussion communications we’d
 issue statement behind us then. intention talk January
 early release minutes expanded use central tendency forecast. forecast
 would big role process forecast appears minutes
 minutes earlier, forecast be, too. staff preparing two documents related
 that. Right communication agenda rather crowded, guidance
 sequencing would helpful.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. could find way group members
 constant alignment similarly minded people, group could assign one person
 representative editing committee. could small group people sitting
 around editing. wouldn’t suggest that’s happen.
 MR. REINHART. think next Secretary, Mr. Chairman, challenge.

 MR. POOLE. Would proposal statement meeting even
 change policy? Would let everything ride publish minutes? we’re going

 MR. MOSKOW. would drop balance risk part statement

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We’d stipulate action took.
 MR. POOLE. Well, that’s easy, there’s explanation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There’s going explanation, two three sentences.
