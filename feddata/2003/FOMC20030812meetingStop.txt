 Greenbook alternative scenario indicates, outcome would obviously put

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll divide review intermeeting
 period two sections. One would describe know, say
 happened. second think, interpret data. First, know?
 others said, data real economy intermeeting period quite
 mixed. labor market continues disappoint, fall latest reading private
 payroll employment shortening workweek. However, many types economic
 data admittedly positive. output side, manufacturing activity seemed
 climb bit toward end second quarter least holding early part

 negatives well.
 financial markets? I’d say there’s perhaps bit bifurcation there.
 Equities turned respectable performance since last meeting. S&P
 basically unchanged, Nasdaq 2 percent, may well reflect
 positive earnings surprises improved outlook. we’ve discussed, however, fixedincome markets much less even run since last meeting, intermeeting
 increases two-year ten-year yields quite dramatic historical standards.
 Importantly, real yields measured TIPS rose significantly less nominal yields
 Treasury securities, suggests increase anticipated compensation inflation.
 Similarly, Governor Kohn already indicated, market expectations monetary policy
 intermeeting period also showed clear upward shift outlook interest rates.
 Now, outlining facts relatively easy. hard part, obviously, us try
 interpret them. regard, think three important questions. first is,
 facts consistent staff forecast outside forecasts gradually improving growth,
 particularly growth starting third quarter? interpretation facts
 seem consistent judgment economy experience much-expected
 turnaround second half year. Admittedly, course, growth still forecast,
 seems that, since last meeting, odds growth occurring certainly
 picked substantially. Even much-discussed run-up fixed-income yields, put
 
 August 12, 2003

 broader context going back May 5, day May FOMC meeting, seem
 outsized.
 second question is, data internally consistent? answer, always
 case, “no, not.” Inconsistencies questions think still abound. First
 foremost, job growth sluggish? sign uncertainty part businesses?
 hand negative side good productivity story? That’s hard
 answer; think it’s probably little both. view, productivity numbers reign

 it’s partly wife telling forty years don’t communicate

 find hard issue address. First, statement expressed
 reservations adding balancing output risk inflation risk. I’ve
 always problem. Second, think phrase “the probability, though minor,
 unwelcome substantial fall inflation” may served us well couple months ago,
 probability substantial fall gets minor, sentence going
 changed. I’m sure that. third problem time change
 anything paragraph, even comma, huge market reaction. way market
 reacts even minor inflections say scares me. think that’s real problem
 trying communicate honest think.
 Along many you, share reluctance pre-commit future policy course.
 However, I’m side Governors Bernanke Kohn feeling probably

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Could reflect opposite concern? statement last time said
 something along lines wording: probability, though minor, unwelcome fall
 inflation exceeds rise inflation. Therefore, believe that, balance, risk
 inflation becoming undesirably low likely predominant concern foreseeable
 future. we’ve added third sentence talks disinflation also
 mentions warding unwelcome disinflation considerable period. I’m wondering
 whether that’s veering little much toward commitment side need ought
 point. would happy stayed less way worded last

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. remember it’s combination wording that’s almost

 MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, may speak this? see others want comment

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Go ahead.
 MR. FERGUSON. sense last sentence, Cathy, it’s actually rather
 important, given we’ve seen terms changes fed funds futures. It’s think

 I’m sure period time is. read last sentence last paragraph

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’d like hear rest you. agree
 Governor Ferguson slight variations way say this. could say,
 example, “in circumstances Committee believes” rather “the Committee judges.”
 alternative perhaps bit softer; “judges” may stronger word. important
 issue, I’d like hear views one way this.
 Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. I’ll suggest compromise. lot people word counts
 statements—count often particular word used. think convey Roger’s sense
 message last sentence cut use word “disinflation” one,
 dropping “aimed raising” way “disinflation.” words, Roger wants
 convey policy accommodation maintained considerable period,
 without words without raising word count disinflation. first point
 offer compromise. Second, actually like sentence, procedurally would
 upset waited next time, really think implications,
 include it. first preference would drop phrase mentioned, second
 choice would hold next time.
 MR. HOENIG. balance, think would preferable drop last sentence
 change statement, gets attention, expectations change.

 repeat said before, we’re signaling everyone policy hold. terms
 policy announcements implications, think safer course, full
 discussion communication issues September meeting. recognize last

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t wish imply monetary policy report

 MR. HOENIG. No, I’m suggesting are. I’m saying
 wording tend bring point forcefully.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Cathy, understand you’re saying, you’re recommending
 simply drop last sentence?
 MS. MINEHAN. would go long way.
 MR. POOLE. would associate position—whether it’s yours.
 MS. MINEHAN. is.
 MR. POOLE. Dropping last sentence would good idea view. read
 next-to-the-last sentence pretty clear signal we’re going hold foreseeable
 future concern possible decline inflation. Making statement
 very, terse, dropping last sentence does, seems send signal we’re
 going stand are—that we’re satisfied current stance policy that’s
 we’re going be. think making statement terse sends
 message.
 MR. PARRY. That’s last time.

 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 MR. MCTEER. Look got us!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don.
 MR. KOHN. Actually, rather like last sentence variation it, though
 recognize involves bit risk. also recognize, think people around
 table would acknowledge, built markets think going
 happen. That’s say tell exactly what’s going happen, I’m little
 concerned disconnect think reaction function
 actually is. difference inflation pressures see coming inflation
 pressures see coming. think it’s worth taking risk change statement make
 point. thought taking sentence Chairman’s testimony, though agree gets
 much attention emphasis statement here, good way that.
 statement testimony retaining balance risks
 last time—even better economic data we’ve had—emphasizes judgment,
 little different market judgment. market wants stay seeing
 statement us, that’s fine; it’s clear market participants understand
 thinking is, think would help—
 MS. MINEHAN. doesn’t “foreseeable future” context
 taking third sentence?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’ve listening conversation, tell
 something point last sentence essentially repeating sentence
 immediately preceding it.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right.

 MR. KOHN. emphasizes it, think.

 minority group, whether they’re currently voting members nonvoting, think we’d
 probably wise leave discuss matters fully September. Governor
 Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. would appeal Committee retain sentence
 view makes big difference. think addition sentence go way
 bringing policy expectations market toward heard around table entire
 meeting today. beneficial effect United States economy,
 ultimate goal Committee. understand due process fairness considerations would
 militate toward going bureaucratic way issue agenda September.
 given ultimate objective helping economy, think right thing leave
 suppressed, shortened, version statement; would appeal Committee
 leave in.
 MR. BROADDUS. weigh this, tend opposite point view
 Governor Bernanke. support Cathy’s position lot reasons already
 stated. don’t think going buy us much. don’t think need it, given
 language preceding sentence. Also, I’m little concerned criticized,
 maybe unfairly, trying manipulate markets, think putting sentence going
 revive sentiment. don’t really need that. going talk topic
 next time. tradeoffs favor pretty strongly putting time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 
 August 12, 2003

 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, I’m sort split last sentence. think final sentence
 second paragraph pricing power really good addition, like lot. part
 last sentence troubles phrase “without ultimately stoking inflationary
 pressures,” haven’t talked about. phrase makes uncomfortable. light
 admonition humble, say maintain accommodative stance “for
 considerable period without ultimately . . .” sounds like extreme position. would suggest
 might want end sentence putting period word “period.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. used there. Let tell alternatives
 seem coming to. would say two choices. Either drop sentence
 completely, say, “In circumstances, Committee believes policy
 accommodation maintained considerable period.” hate ask vote, it’s
 way I’m going get real sense group. One alternative leave
 truncated version; drop entirely. stipulate that, unless get significant
 vote favor putting in, would recommend drop bring discussion—
 particular sentence basic process—next time. May see show hands?
 MR. PARRY. Could read again, please?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. fact, let read whole last paragraph. think
 that’s better way it. “The Committee perceives upside downside risks

 discussion.

 way intermeeting discussion.
