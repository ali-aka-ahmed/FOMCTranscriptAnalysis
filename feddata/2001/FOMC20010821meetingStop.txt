 economy changed significantly since report June, reports seem
 somewhat pessimistic before, least near future. Overall activity
 remained quite sluggish disappointing many businesses expected,
 least hoped, evidence upturn would visible now. expected
 improvement economy seems future met June. fact,
 business people talk expect significant recovery manufacturing next

 Manufacturing weakest link year now. key

 overall production remains weak. light vehicle industry somewhat exception;
 average inventories good shape. Production nationally trending

 mentioned earlier. far year, substantial incentives needed keep light vehicle

 firms still attempting reduce costs cautious

 gypsum wallboard industry also plagued over-capacity despite fact robust

 One piece good news came paper industry demand cardboard

 retailers continue lower sales expectations fall winter.
 housing markets remain relatively robust, although contacts skeptical

 Things quite rosy nonresidential construction side. Office vacancy

 large firms leases coming renewal consistently cutting back office space
 requirements. trends visible nationwide well, significant adverse
 impact office furniture industry concentrated western Michigan. industry
 expects see sharpest drop shipments since records first tallied early ’70s.
 Since slowdown began, labor markets eased somewhat
 nation whole. District employers still reporting it’s less difficult hire
 retain workers areas wage pressures subsided further. Total payroll

 correction, great surprise, drags still. world economic outlook looks even
 bleak, political financial tensions threatening exacerbate situation further.
 Although housing somehow continues levitate, recent auto sales may hinting

 MS. MINEHAN. actually me!
 MR. BROADDUS. that’s fair question. answer would give

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, stage preliminarily statement
