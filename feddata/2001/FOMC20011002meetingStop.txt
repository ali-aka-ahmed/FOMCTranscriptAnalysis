 what’s going District economy. Much written report

 consumer spending first days following attacks essentially stopped
 tracks. reports large retailers District suggest sales bounced back
 quite quickly. Now, I’m talking big-ticket items. exclusive autos
 homes forth. activity malls--at discount stores even department

 restaurants District surprisingly busy, least last couple weeks.
 Housing activity, sound, remains sound. reported last

 was, course, major expansion airport way project
 slowed put hold. don’t think situation go long unless
 people prepared let project rust sits there. lot
 cancellations prospective conventions. September October big
 convention months Minneapolis, matters good deal. hotels running
 low occupancy rates travel-related businesses similarly affected.
 airports I’ve least quiet, although Northwest Airlines
 reported improvement future bookings. I’m sure exactly make
 that, airline people seem somewhat surprised what’s coming pike.
 Obviously, business community opinion general aggressive
 action fiscal side monetary policy side appropriate here. don’t
 go far door hear somebody business community offer
 opinion. One development wake this, lost one medium-sized
 brokerage firm involved ill-advised securities lending transaction.
 far national economy concerned, thinking outlook
 listening staff discussion, key word obviously uncertainty. happen
 think near-term outlook weakness projected Greenbook,
 wouldn’t put much stock forecast. many people already said,
 we’re environment really don’t know lot about. Normally,
 
 10/2/01
 
 42
 
 uncertainty goes up, implies need policy caution avoid
 significant errors. current situation fairly certain--or least
 opinion--that downside risks magnified inflation risks
 diminished. event though, I’m sure economic policy going key
 relatively near-term future. think need tranquility home success
 abroad.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, economy Tenth District, like

 England suggest regional economy slowed, possibly increasing rate,

 value manufactured exports declined, especially computers electronics,
 consumer business confidence fell substantially. data almost entirely
 predate tragic events September 11th.
 feel developments region since time therefore
 relies anecdotal sources science. certainly understand Dave Stockton’s
 comment desire speak less little science one’s side,
 feel compelled explore anecdotal reports heard. Bank
 benefit hearing attended two regularly scheduled advisory
 committee meetings--our small business academic advisory councils--and two
 regularly scheduled bankers’ forums, took place September 11th.
 addition, tragedy, spoke personally several Bank’s
 directors outside regular meetings CEOs several large manufacturing

 calls Beige Book contacts. Several themes emerged interactions.
 First, economic activity across wide sample firms industries
 slowing even advance September 11th, though news bad. strong
 dollar slowing demand contributed problems many regional manufacturers,
