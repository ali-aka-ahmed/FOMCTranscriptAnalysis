 10- 30-year yields target fed funds rate first time
 since May 2000.
 chart bottom panel depicts fact
 Treasury yield curve phenomenon. U.S. swap curve steepened
 substantially well since last December, U.K. Canadian
 yield curves, although lesser amount. euro-area swap curve
 remained less unchanged, although also steepened last
 day two.
 Moving third page taking somewhat longer-term perspective,
 shown 2- 30-year spread January 1989 March

 policy. sharp steepening curve –50 +150 basis points

 bottom panel shows, despite steepening backup yields,

 bottom panel, red line depicts Treasury’s general balance
 April 2nd May 11th year. Treasury’s general balance
 topped $70 billion early May, remained comfortably
 TT&L capacity. Therefore, able avoid large reserve
 drains associated buildup Treasury’s Fed balance
 become norm last years. fact, looked back historical
 data found first time least 15 years general
 balance exceed TT&L capacity therefore spill onto
 Fed. two reasons this. One Treasury made
 efficient use cash management bills; secondly, Treasury St.
 Louis Fed successfully campaigned banks bring additional collateral
 TT&L program thus raise capacity.
 Finally, last page thought would give Committee quick
 update outright operations. almost year since
 established single-issue limits SOMA holdings. top panel
 shows, we’ve increase outright operations. blue portions
 bars represent net portfolio expansion. gray portions represent
 amount purchased offset effects redeemed securities.
 see, 2000 redemptions relatively infrequent.
 sharp reduction size auctions combined single-issue
 limits, SOMA redemptions basically every month. 2000
 2001 date, well projection rest year, 50
 percent outright purchases offset effects redemptions.
 bottom panel depicts number outright operations Desk

 operations stayed 6 higher. scale Desk’s activity
 growing time size market shrinking, placing
 somewhat burden outright operations. looking
 coming weeks ways ease pressure outright operations,
 one likely ways expanded use long-term repos.

 Mr. Chairman, foreign exchange operations

 glad take questions.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Dino?
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.

 MR. PARRY. question Dino Kohn. shown page 2
 Dino’s handout, yields 10-year 30-year Treasury bonds actually hit low point
 roughly time March FOMC meeting and, course, moved since then. It’s
 rather interesting since time March Greenbook forecast--and also think
 private forecasts--has become little pessimistic economy’s prospects, least
 shorter term. mean movement rates really due reevaluation
 longer-run expectations inflation?
 MR. KOS. Especially recently, steepening yield curve,
 chatter markets possible explanation. don’t know forecasts
 inflation actually rising. least reading research commentary, haven’t
 seen people raising expectations inflation. may they’re using
 explanation explain steepening yield curve otherwise can’t quite explain.
 MR. PARRY. Well, usually two reasons. answer implied one,
 decline funds rate raises prospects economy recover.
 possibility inflation could become concern.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. third, may fact relevant here.
 Since March meeting, one listens discussions coming Treasury White
 House, presumption eliminating Treasury debt becoming less vocal
 attenuated. Hence, reduction yields attributable scarcity premium clearly
 changed. doesn’t eliminate possibility increased inflation premiums. Indeed, see
 TIPS yields.
 MR. PARRY. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. may involved issue know.
 
 5
 
 5/15/01
 
 MR. KOHN. think interesting disparity intermeeting
 period views markets views economists. markets seem
 become optimistic economy going potential recovery,
 whereas economists--not economists building, Wall Street
 well--have become little less optimistic. market built bottom federal funds
 rate somewhere 3.75 4 percent. market participants even sure
 you’ll need extra 25 basis points move 3.75 percent, 50 basis
 points today. one looks forecasts economists, many funds rate
 going least 3.75 percent; see FOMC stopping 4 percent.
 many 3.75, many 3.50, low 3 percent. think difference
 market participants economists opened quite bit intermeeting period.
 believe market view encouraged certain extent earnings reports
 businesses, least worse downward revised expectations already
 built in. They’ve reacted little, saw last Friday, viewed positive
 news sales consumer confidence. seem looking plus side
 news change instead minus side, they’ve raised estimate low
 funds rate. think rise rates reflects real factors inflation expectations,
 would perfectly consistent economy going stronger. Particularly look
 TIPS spreads, markets built decline inflation especially gloomy
 economic prospects, they’ve taken decline out. I’m sure really
 expecting inflation rise here, think they’ve taken previously saw
 good odds decline.

 staff’s off-the-run synthetic yield measure April last year came way
 down.
 MR. KOHN. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We’re back was.
 MR. PARRY. course, Greenbook forecast would suggest price
 pressures, anything, likely little less.
 MR. KOHN. Right, that’s part disparity we’re talking about.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you.

 24th month, remain silent then.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation generally.
 may, let make additional comments indicate way I’ve thinking this.
 said earlier made economic statement, believe it’s important put
 context. context I’m thinking amount overall leeway
 real federal funds rate. seems me, given outlook today, certainly move
 real funds rate zero. realize differences opinion inflation
 expectations, Michigan survey, example, saying one-year-ahead inflation
 expectations 3 percent. that’s case, nominal funds rate currently 4-1/2
 percent, real funds rate something like 1-1/2 percent. know one argue
 that’s right, don’t lot downside leeway left.
 reflecting ought today, found helpful look economic
 situation last time real funds rate zero--which roughly September ’92
 September ’93--and compare current situation. earlier period, inflation
 3 percent drifting down, long rates coming down, running
 financial headwinds. unemployment rate 7 percent, higher today. trend
 productivity growth still weak; got late 1990s. Government
 deficit--remember those?--was still problem talk tax increase deal
 it.
 Today different situation. Inflation 3 percent
 drifting up, long rates rising. Lending institutions well capitalized,
 
 5/15/01
 
 84
 
 we’re looking financial headwinds experiencing then. unemployment rate
 drifting up, 4-1/2 percent still relatively low level. may advantage
 couple additional points trend productivity budget surplus people
 talking tax reduction. zero real funds rate policy earlier period
 worked well, think. view helped lay solid financial monetary foundation
 fine economic performance late 1990s. comparison two
 periods suggests overall economy bottom now, zero real funds rate
 might low context leeway target mentioned earlier. think that’s important.
 case, led think decision morning following way.
 Though guess one thought seriously 75 basis point alternative
 Bluebook, clearly, background I’ve tried lay out, would much.
 could push real rate lower would want economy hit bottom
 began turn up. side argument, believe case could made
 reduction 25 basis points today. there’s big part thinks ought
 making case! obviously would disappoint expectations. would risk prolonging
 time economy gets bottom might make bottom deeper need
 be. process elimination come are, 50 basis points right move
 today.
 really key point reduce funds rate amount, we’re
 going reduce leeway--based way I’m looking it--significantly further.
 might differ bit. reduced leeway, think ought
 careful respect expectations foster we’re going here.
 view, would helpful signal markets there’s limit process
 
 85
 
 5/15/01
 
 may closing it. could go symmetric balanced risk statement; think case
 could made that. drop rate 50 basis points keep asymmetric risk
 statement--which is, course, expected--at minimum would hope press release
 language would suggest may closing limit easing process. believe
 begin get idea built in, within context going long run.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. agree recommendations, Mr. Chairman.
 would like associate closely everything President Broaddus said.
 could supported move 50 basis points balanced risk statement; could
 supported 25 basis points statement risks continue weighted toward economic
 weakness. could supported argued for--although Al much better job would
 have--either one positions.
 think critical, though, going send signal, send
 message Committee various speeches. way denigrating
 efforts regard, Mr. Chairman, want send message Committee
 believe important fact send Committee. would reiterate -CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. actually suggesting send June.
 MS. MINEHAN. Instead now?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 MS. MINEHAN. Well, think Al Broaddus point, may worthwhile
 statement put today say something limits far go one
 direction.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, believe would prudent cut rate
 support proposed reduction 50 basis points. meeting also prefer retain

 close point seriously re-examine stance. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation 50
 basis point cut asymmetric directive toward economic weakness. think it’s important
 start getting word out, suggested comments Al Broaddus Cathy
 Minehan. Let make several points. One start indicating 250 basis
 points ease may enough--that take time cuts impact
 economy. make clear may decide ease time-but waiting watching monitoring carefully--and also inflation concern
 longer term. could put statement today. Or, recommendation start talking
 speech May 24th put statement June fine me.
 think that’s reasonable way proceed going forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. concur recommendation, Mr. Chairman. However,
 given view economic outlook, think would useful us try telegraph
 message indicates we’re getting close end process. druthers, I’d
 probably go 25 basis points today tilt toward economic weakness indicate
 would prepared respond indications weakness. go 50 point,
 
 5/15/01
 
 87
 
 believe it’s still necessary leave tilt. Nonetheless, view would useful least
 include wording press release indicates indeed eased lot.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. I’d like amplify
 couple aspects position. regard April 18th rate cut, expressed
 reservations, haven’t changed view that. rate cut fact.
 Committee action indicated several things. First all, suggested great sense urgency.
 press statement released time action indicated great deal concern weak
 investment. view practically announcement another 50 basis point cut
 meeting. That’s way market interpreted it; fed funds market quickly bid high
 probability another 50 basis points meeting. Since April 18th, seen weak
 employment report, industrial production down, we’ve heard lots news weak
 investment layoffs. think 50 basis points today reflects
 said going would make sense surprise markets one direction
 April 18th surprise direction May 15th. view it’s critical
 50 basis points today. time comes move funds rate up, it’s going make
 difference whether start rate 4 percent 4-1/4 percent; we’re going face
 essentially kinds issues. consistent think need cut rate 50
 basis points today, feel strongly that.
 terms future, would say couple things. First all, developed
 balance risk language, tried make statement outlook economy
 outlook policy. might want remind people that. might
 want remind that, given lags policy, might still see economic weakness
 
 5/15/01
 
 88
 
 ahead necessarily interpret mean would call additional policy
 easing. Secondly, would like put outlook rates coming months way. don’t
 know sure whether rate cuts required. think probabilities less
 even next rate change going down. We’re uncertain situation,
 believe would mistake say know sure easing process come
 end. all, gave lots reasons outlook could weaker
 best guess. don’t think say easing process necessarily end.
 view say believe less equal probability next
 rate change don’t know future going develop.
 would take sense try impart marketplace something
 could come along quickly wipe away suggestion process end.
 Things could happen abroad wherever. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. share many general sentiments
 Presidents Broaddus Minehan expressed. fact, think could go bit make
 reasonable case ought pause today. given tide, won’t belabor issue.
 Nevertheless, key issue lag question. It’s certainly well acknowledged
 lag actions effects economy. point we’re going
 remind market participants, probably relatively forceful way, lags.
 point we’re going take pause, probably well altogether convincing
 evidence economy stabilizing improving. think day is, here,
 far away. consequence, believe need quite cautious stage.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 
 89
 
 5/15/01
 
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation. would
 add concerned overt comment today possible ending easing
 process might well bit premature two reasons. First, would premature
 downside probabilities we’re concerned materialize; do, could
 problem said that. Second, release asymmetric tilt--as think
 it’s honest thing say now--then coupled strong
 statement ending process could send market confusing message
 counterproductive impact.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation
 50 basis point easing today statement risks remain unbalanced toward economic
 weakness. hand, could also joined Presidents Minehan Broaddus
 supporting case slowing pace easing today moving 25 basis points.
 might effective way signaling sentiment need move
 toward cautious monetary policy may far ending easing cycle.
 importantly, Mr. Chairman, agree believe really
 important issue, prospect may near point--and perhaps
 move point--where cautious easing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree recommendation.
 I’m fortunate speaking order agree four people
 spoke prior say. First, think President Poole absolutely right remind us
 language balance risks economy clearly tried get
 
 90
 
 5/15/01
 
 away predicting might terms policy. happen think today
 balance risks toward side and, therefore, current language
 retained. agree President Stern always risk overshooting.
 sense also join Governor Meyer I, too, don’t know future going be,
 don’t think try signal one way other. great uncertainty,
 agree Governor Kelley say, shouldn’t try send message
 future press statement future unknown. Contrary fact
 use words “foreseeable future” statement, actually foreseeable. [Laughter]
 don’t know suggested use words! seriously, don’t think
 try signal much statement. finally, point honestly
 disagree you, Mr. Chairman. certainly feel free present
 views upcoming speech, would concerned emerges perception
 speeches trying anything yet. desire, suspect, make clear
 inflation concern. don’t want markets think aren’t concerned it.
 given prevailing degree uncertainty, I’d prefer press statement speak
 get back together another statement speaks itself.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Mark Anthony said burst Cleopatra’s bedroom, I’m
 make speech. agree recommendations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Careful, sir! Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Bob, that’s tough act follow! [Laughter] planning

 MR. MCTEER. You’re going let comment discourage you, though!
 
 91
 
 5/15/01
 
 MR. GRAMLICH. First, support recommendations, Mr. Chairman.
 time, agree many others around table can’t continue ease monetary
 policy large steps. see wall looming there. don’t see quite yet, said
 earlier, it’s aware it. lags mindful
 that.
 press statement, think views closest Mike Kelley’s. It’s soon
 go balanced risk statement. view--if makes sense--we
 relatively unobtrusive statement today.
 last comment want make lot us found Bluebook exercise
 real funds rate computed various ways useful, would like propose
 others continue provide analysis. view it’s good way think
 monetary policy. keep looking it, we’ll get used we’ll get sense
 ought wandering gray band wandering gray
 band. So, would propose staff keep exercise.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I’m comfortable comments Al, Cathy,
 Tony, Gary. actually would prefer come today’s meeting clear signal
 slowed pace easing--not we’ve stopped easing we’ve slowed
 pace. read announcement intermeeting action month ago signaling
 clearly going move another 50 basis points today. I, too, thought could
 give signal coming today’s meeting concluded could change
 balanced risk statement. seems 25 basis point easing would cleaner,
 preferable action. would call fewer words press statement cause less confusion
 
 5/15/01
 
 92
 
 approaches suggested. I’m sure go five 50 basis
 point easing moves cold turkey withdrawal easing process. So, view
 25 basis point easing today would clean way get different trajectory reasons
 discussed around table may need that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, think pull back throttle today.
 past four one-half months we’ve moved policy aggressive way easier
 position. view additional 50 basis point cut move us overly accommodative
 position. We’ve added significant liquidity market. let work
 far cautious moves. think opportunity 25
 basis point move asymmetric risk statement today give signal you’re
 suggesting. I’m view 25 basis point cut, retention statement
 risk weighted weakness output, now. certainly agree risk
 weaker growth continues dominate risk inflation now. lot easing
 train. additional 25 basis points would continue easing; wouldn’t stop easing
 process. policy, know, works lag. Thus relative risks shifted since
 last meeting--though point predominant risk inflation,
 think appropriate reduce rates. preferred approach would take us less aggressive
 trajectory prepare market acting either direction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. think disappointing market--not
 already built market--is bad thing, think it’s inevitable. stopped

 percent. didn’t. stopped tightening last spring said going raise
 rate 7-1/2 8 percent. didn’t. think there’s going another time
 disappoint market’s expectations. I’m afraid message seen old
 message: another 50 basis points, another balance risks statement toward economic weakness,
 FOMC come back thing June. I’d happier
 change 1/4 point reduction today. we’re going that, think Bob
 McTeer’s idea Board consider taking discount rate 1/4 point might
 least send different message meeting rather relying speeches change
 expectation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. seeming majority cut 50 basis
 points statement risks asymmetric toward economic weakness. Could read
 appropriate statement?
 MR. GILLUM. Yes, Mr. Chairman. reading page 14 Bluebook.
 directive wording is: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial
 conditions foster price stability promote sustainable growth output.
 long-run objectives, Committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets
 consistent reducing federal funds rate average around 4 percent.” balance

 MR. BROADDUS. think statement drafted likely build

 5/15/01
 MR. GUYNN. I’ll echo that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May comments everybody, please?
 Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Actually, think would good idea. also would like see
 two parts statement adjusted. I’d suggest last part second paragraph,
 reads “threatens keep pace economic activity unacceptably weak,” toned
 bit. could say factors “continue weigh economy” something like
 that. proposed wording seems little sharp. perhaps could add reference-maybe sentence says reduction excess inventories seems well advanced--to
 fact consumption housing expenditures held reasonably well. might
 also note considerable easing last half year begin support economic
 growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, considering European
 Central Bank managed completely confuse market hurt credibility
 recently, think trying say things essentially contradictory--or easily
 interpreted way--has avoided. wish give signal easing moves
 likely over, balance risks statement becomes questionable--even though know
 balance risks statement future economic activity. market would
 clearly believe trying ways--trying say one hand might
 ease economy might weak, hand might finished

 you, assume seeking achieve.

 large signal received statement, we’ve
 removed notion intermeeting move. going sound big gong. say
 easing moves may slow may over. minimum Committee slowed

 interpreted. interpreted allow market read it. preferable
 trying give two signals--one says yes says no--and winding

 responsibilities. Also, given view us have--particularly you, Mr. Chairman,
 I, too, guess--about downside risks, last thing want central bank
 looks confused. want downside risks, confused central bank surely bring them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. First, pick point President McDonough made,
 think another signal fact list Reserve Banks requesting discount rate
 decrease incomplete one; interpreted feeling within Committee.
 earlier comments suggested indicate market weren’t going
 move again, think reasons stated counterproductive, rather
 moved 250 basis points. neutral statement conveys fact.
 interpreted indication feel taken substantial steps. That’s
 way think could constructively amend statement, that’s call.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. two suggestions. First, take second third

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. suggestions along lines President Minehan’s. would
 shorten statement.
 MS. MINEHAN. Considerably!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. guess come side, seems

 believe statement fairly accurate description discussion would keep
 much is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, I’d like support Governor Meyer, particularly
 softening statement end second paragraph. believe “threatens keep
 pace economic activity unacceptably weak” bit stronger wording need use.
 think language suggested, “continues weigh economy” accurate
 adequate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, language draft previous
 statement, know.
 MR. MEYER. Well, think would good different statement. That’s
 good reason change it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. comments stage? Governor Gramlich.

 MR. GRAMLICH. basically support statement. might note
 actually three changes previous statement, remember it. First, dropped
 “alert” sentence. Secondly, Tony mentioned, fewer Banks listed put
 discount rate reduction. third, unlike last statement, one least mentions word

 draft. Perhaps could make changes adjectives last sentence
 second paragraph. But, said before, I’d like keep statement fairly unobtrusive
 generally pattern recent statements. changed important ways
 already.
