 consistent argument involving erosion budget surplus. Would
 offer view that?
 
 11/6/01
 
 26
 
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Sure. I’d say two things. One, think longer-run budget
 outlook accompanying fiscal policy underlie outlook factors influencing
 long-term interest rates. look implied one-year forward rate, currently showing
 rates rising levels prevailing January--though you’re right, huge
 amount. However, news received since January--this enormous contraction
 capital spending--would factor working depress view equilibrium
 real interest rates might going period. So, view, seen effect
 fiscal policy structure interest rates certainly factor interpreting
 happened. It’s quite clear models--and think there’s reasonably sound economic
 theory view--that equilibrium long-term real interest rates would related long-run

 Looking ahead, recession forecast deep Greenbook’s. projected

 far national economy concerned, data come since last

 0.4 percent could lot worse may revised lower, Friday’s negative jobs report
 makes clear economy headed toward eventually defined recession.
 That’s really side issue. key question policy, others already indicated,
 severe depth duration. Comparing current situation historical
 experience suggests reasons believe especially deep
 prolonged. First, almost everyone already observed, monetary policy eased steadily since
 first year presently accommodative. Second, significant government private
 sector spending stimulus put place recent tax cut, government
 spending programs likely. Security investment, rebuilding, insurance payment flows

 likely bolster spending. Admittedly, types expenditures lead productivity
 increases. I’m especially worried need keep personal income
 moving near term business fixed investment recovers. added spending
 help, really form stop-gap income maintenance. Third, economy received major
 shock September 11th, banking financial sectors sound proved largely
 resilient. examiners tell us banks continue lend prudently that,
 deterioration loan portfolios occurred, losses especially worrisome point.
 Unlike financial situation previous economic contractions, it’s hard argue
 financial system weakness reduced credit availability contributed likely contribute

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, economy Tenth District really

 Let mention energy industry. eased since last meeting.
 District’s rig count 25 percent decreased level July, steep fall

 agriculture, prices dropped cattle industry, know, partly
 drop-off restaurant demand September 11th attacks also large
 inventory feed lines. Crop prices also weak, although there’s reason little
 optimism storage levels high year ago. Overall, business
 conditions District generally poor.
 Turning national economy, would agree say recession.
 outlook, forecast differs ways Greenbook, would say
 terms outcome it’s matter degree, substance. context, though, think it’s
 important look two time frames. One immediate future--that is, fourth quarter--which

 intermediate term--the first half next year second half--where outlook

 significant amount stimulus already play, economy recover first

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Overall underlying economic
 conditions District worsened somewhat since meeting five weeks ago.
 slight rebound initial decline activity saw September 11th,
 underlying trend still downward tilt contacts acknowledge good deal pessimism
 regarding rest year. October business outlook survey gave us first data
 District since September 11th. Prior attacks, manufacturing region appeared
 stabilizing. longer case. index current activity took sharp downturn
 
 11/6/01
 
 47
 
 October, indicating manufacturing activity continued contract District much
 faster pace prior months. Indeed, index levels saw beginning
 year. striking consistency across indices. New orders, shipments,
 employment indices fell sharply October. Manufacturers’ capital spending plans remained
 weak.
 October survey asked special questions try gauge effects
 September 11th attacks. First, asked firm attacks affected shipments
 new orders. Half firms reported shipments unaffected. 40 percent reported
 decrease 10 percent said significant one. results new orders
 troubling, since 50 percent firms reported decrease orders, suggesting activity
 continue weak coming months. also repeated question previous
 month’s survey asking firms expected see turnaround. results indicate
 many respondents putting rebound future past.
 good news, however, 75 percent respondents still expect see
 turnaround second half next year.
 economic indicators District weak. Payroll employment
 three states declined third quarter unemployment rate increased. likely go
 higher subsequent months, given current pace layoffs. Retail sales District
 running last year’s pace. Zero percent financing boosted motor vehicle sales
 region, many others indicated Districts, dealers expect sales decline later
 year since incentives pulling sales forward well generating new sales. Indeed, dealers
 report us limiting orders factories. Retail sales goods
 services risen recent weeks regained levels seen terrorist attacks.
 
 11/6/01

 Finally, construction activity District, one better-performing sectors
 downturn, eased somewhat. Homebuilders District generally report steady demand
 new homes, softening demand higher-priced housing. Nonresidential
 construction activity begun fall off.
 national level, events September11th aftermath significantly
 weakened near-term outlook economy. Even attacks, economy
 sluggish many us forecasted earlier year. initial estimate shows contraction
 GDP growth third quarter, surprise. forecasts, including own,
 see sharp contraction fourth quarter. Typically longer-run outlook least certain,
 days economists feel certain long-run prospects economy
 medium-term. Assuming shocks, see pickup activity next year, driven
 aggressive monetary fiscal stimulus. difficulty, course, determining pickup
 occur whether monetary stimulus help ensure better outcome.
 outlook similar Greenbook’s, although rebounds much stronger
 historically one forecasting. addition, Philadelphia staff analysis suggests
 forecasters typically underpredict response output growth expansionary monetary
 policy. Nonetheless, incoming data certainly point continued economic weakness near
 term one could easily argue current period represents break past history.
 October NAPM survey, like Bank’s business outlook survey, indicates manufacturing
 continue struggle. Labor market indicators point accelerated job losses. sizable drop
 consumer confidence suggests continued weakness consumer spending. surge October
 auto sales drew sales future, vehicle sales likely fall future months.
 
 11/6/01

 Nevertheless, auto sales data illustrate stimulative effect interest rate declines even
 times increased uncertainty unease.
 leave us? response devastating events September 11th,
 Committee’s focus appropriately turned immediate term acted swiftly
 significantly. fed funds rate 100 basis points lower September 10th. Two
 months passed since attack. certainly want underestimate amount
 weakness seeing economy expect see coming months. I’m
 sufficiently unsure timing strength forecasted recovery, even given sizable
 monetary stimulus already applied economy, would support easing action.
 However, seems incumbent upon us begin shift focus back medium
 longer term. doing, would acknowledge significant amount monetary fiscal
 policy stimulus applied economy. almost every measure, monetary policy
 quite accommodative fiscal stimulus way. Focusing medium
 longer term would help us prepare markets public time Committee
 decides rate cuts needed. would also shift focus monetary
 fiscal policy. would give us flexibility going forward gather additional data

 financial markets, particularly equity markets futures markets--and perhaps even

 However, buried within potentially positive signs negative ones,

 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. important theme last meeting
 uncertainty. meeting reasonably close September 11th still hard sort
 data. It’s easier sorting now. paraphrase Murphy’s Law, almost everything
 could go down, did. It’s pretty hard find sources strength today’s economy.

 employment, NAPM survey, durable goods orders, consumer confidence, industrial production,
 commodity prices, foreign demand growth, list. seems especially

 Many commentators arguing happened interest rates
 cut, monetary policy must impotent. Perhaps I’m preaching choir here, since
 think it’s relevant decision, let spend minute taking argument. sure,
 monetary policy fighting powerful downward forces year, far powerful
 think us imagined start year. Policy easings may curative

 clearly seems held spending housing consumer durables, especially autos. It’s
 possible even positive effect investment, though it’s obviously hard make
 case given powerful downward impact capital overhang.
 agree critics theoretical empirical questions
 ways monetary policy allegedly stimulates economy. One suspect channel
 
 11/6/01

 currency values, perhaps raises expected profits perhaps conditions might
 become even weaker economies.
 suspect channel involves wealth effect. seems doubt
 rise future productivity raise equity values consumption, people try consume
 future anticipated income front. whether falling interest rates rising relative
 house prices, raise computed net worth, also raise consumption always
 matter theoretical ambiguity.
 monetary policy perhaps potent believe, still powerful
 impacts, still used fight downward movements, still effective maintaining
 spending year. face powerful downward momentum seems come
 day’s economic news, think choice use instrument emphatically
 can.
 Finally, let say one word reversibility, something
 worried. Much Greenbook recovery hinges additional fiscal stimulus, somewhat
 doubt political reasons perhaps even economically treacherous. It’s much
 stretch say world recovery hinges U.S. recovery, hinges fiscal policy,
 hinges politics. exaggeration, admit, much. It’s easy
 imagine slow recovery world give us plenty time reverse

 Although fiscal actions consideration discussed earlier several around

 quite attractive tempting. However, given present environment extremely low capacity

 Beyond whatever level capital spending occur regardless events, great many firms,
 especially smaller ones constitute half nation’s production, likely

 Larger stronger companies maneuvering room managing capital

 MR. HOENIG. May ask one question? 50 basis point move,
 opinion going affect markets’ expectations going forward? expectations
 completely revised instead 75 basis points ease horizon
 talk another 75 basis points would go larger cut?
 MR. KOHN. think move 50 basis points relatively small effect
 market expectations. all, markets already built two-thirds probability 50
 basis point cut. don’t put much weight precise measurement probability,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. good news

 Let also address Tom’s question. I’ve little trouble
 changes 50, 25, even 75 basis points aren’t huge. Tom points out, there’s
 argument getting funds rate down, don’t get down? way would rationalize
 we’re sense speaking code here. We’ve
 operating procedure 50 points viewed big change Fed
 responsive. move 25 basis points viewed little change Fed
 responsive. Seventy-five basis points language we’ve never used. think it’s particularly

 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation, although certainly

 certainly said many occasions--and said thing--we believe U.S.
 economy essentially undiminished long-run prospects. question, suppose,
 long-run prospects materialize. believe coming 2008 2010, that’s long
 time away. seems tenor views around table may very,

 difficult period--one clear analog history, yet one date
 absolute level decline activity mild. apparently projecting considerable
 risk steeper decline come. So, really want reduction funds rate translate
 declines longer-term interest rates, think need change bit tone say

 prospects economy sound essentially undiminished say that.
 
 11/6/01
 
 85
 
 also need say something along lines--I don’t know word this--that ahead us,
 calendar quarters maybe even years, significant risk economy could require

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let comment that. First all, seriously

 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, know mean. don’t think time
 sounding quite negative security.
 MR. FERGUSON. Well, could say “appropriate” “necessary” diversion
 resources enhance security something along lines suggest well understood
 resources used way?
 MR. KELLEY. think word “necessary” good.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, don’t say “necessary diversion
 resources”?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes, it.
 MR. PARRY. “reallocation resources”?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, “necessary” addresses issue Cathy raising.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. turns positive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. adequate?
 MR. GRAMLICH. Well, let first comment broader point I’ll also talk
 words used. Continuing Bill McDonough’s whistling wind argument, think
 also show recognize phenomenon, whether call reallocation

 diversion resources. think actually tie there. “Necessary” fine me.
 Also, there’s double clause “and protect disruptions.” might need
 that. lot words devoted sentence could stripped down. view
 recognize productivity comes back, also
 diversion resources occurring. Otherwise message doesn’t look real.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would feel better said: “The necessary diversion
 resources enhance security likely detract advances productivity time”?
 MR. KOHN. “necessary reallocation resources”? think
 somebody’s suggestion. sounds little better.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Okay.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That’s better.
 MS. MINEHAN. economic slowdown produces reduction
 productivity.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, reference structural productivity. might
 note estimate productivity third quarter going coming tomorrow.
 don’t know precise number going be, it’s going show strong productivity
 quarter. subtracted September 11th problem, would supportive fact
 structural changes productivity last four five years.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. it’s cyclical productivity we’re talking about.
 MS. MINEHAN. No, realize that.
 MR. JORDAN. Mr. Chairman, could offer slightly different perspective? may
 consistent bothering Cathy. last clause clear statement productivity growth

 good. might think everybody around table might think that. hypothetically,
 suppose 20 years ago substituted term “to enhance security” phrase “to clean
 air water”? vast majority people believe whatever done
 country enhance security good. tone statement somehow suggest
 really unfortunate country this, think undesirable.
 MS. MINEHAN. That’s point exactly. stated much better did. 
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree that. That’s words “necessary 
 
 reallocation”-MS. MINEHAN. don’t think takes away negative tenor.
 MS. JOHNSON. Pardon me, it’s measurement issue, isn’t it? GDP doesn’t
 measure increased security; doesn’t give better security positive weight. way get
 word “measurement” here?
 SPEAKER(?). Measured productivity.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, may it.
 MS. MINEHAN. We’re trying get across sophisticated concept here.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, measured productivity. think key question far
 statement goes is: want leave “and protect production disruptions”?
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, right.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. don’t think need that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sentence long. Let read see whether
 need phrase. “Although necessary…” want say “reallocation”
 “diversion”?
 SEVERAL. “Reallocation.”
 
 11/6/01
 
 96
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. “Reallocation” positive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. “Although necessary reallocation resources
 enhance security likely detract measured advances productivity time, longterm prospects productivity growth economy remain favorable become
 evident unusual forces restraining demand abate.”
 MS. MINEHAN. keep “advances productivity” say “measured
 productivity”?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. first reference measured productivity. second
 one true productivity growth would leave word “measured” out.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes.
 MS. MINEHAN. one could argue, along lines President Jordan did,
 actual productivity U.S. economy better might looked
 overhead expenditures clean air clean water. reallocation resources may turn
 terrible development.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let tell problem is. we’re going get
 this, we’ve got serious problem, whether fact we’re measuring efficiency
 improvements quality standard living.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Environmental types controls increase
 efficiency. improve quality life. Measured productivity efficiency.
 MS. MINEHAN. improved quality life could make overall labor force
 efficient.
 
 11/6/01
 
 97
 
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s conceivable, that’s measured.
 One way looking lot activities basically don’t benefit us
 sense protective. big chunk medical expenditures falls category; depends
 whether expense preventive curative purposes. I’m trying get
 involves serious conceptual problem.
 MS. MINEHAN. know.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t want get that.
 MS. MINEHAN. No, don’t. also don’t think want come
 statement could interpreted negatively. Granted, zillion different sophisticated
 arguments one make statement true. still think public interpretation
 negative regard security.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say “the appropriate reallocation resources”?
 made statement testimony Congress much way. got positive responses.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Absolutely. dispute major premise here,
 it’s negative. don’t find negative Federal Reserve say investment
 security good thing, view we’re saying. absolutely fail see that’s
 negative.
 MS. MINEHAN. Well, maybe it’s interpretation. think investment security
 good thing right now. That’s need.
 MR. REINHART. Mr. Chairman, wanted appear neutral, verb
 “detracts” may also seem negative.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 
 11/6/01
 
 98
 
 
 MR. REINHART. instead said “is likely slow advance measured
 productivity” think would pretty much go direction neutrality.
 MR. BROADDUS. think that’s good. I’d suggest language “may restrain
 advances productivity,” shorter less awkward.
 MS. MINEHAN. “may restrain advances near-term measurements
 productivity.”
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. You’re roll, Al! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s it.
 MR. PARRY. “May restrain advances?”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, context don’t really need measured. Let
 reread it. “Although the”--do want say necessary appropriate?
 SPEAKER(?). “Appropriate.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. “Although appropriate reallocation resources
 enhance security may restrain advances productivity time, long-term prospects” etc.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Great.
 MS. MINEHAN. That’s shorter.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think it.
 SPEAKER(?). right!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. May ask question? second paragraph, third line,
 phrase “for foreseeable future” new statement?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, it’s part boilerplate.
 MR. MOSKOW. previous statements?
 
 11/6/01
 
 99
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh yes, it’s part boilerplate. 
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We’ve statements since 
 
 Ferguson Committee came it.
 MR. MEYER. It’s slightly different location statement, always use it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay?
 MR. MOSKOW. Fine.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, may suggest Committee reconsider using word
 “necessary” describe reallocation resources rather “appropriate”? Several people
 suggested “necessary” course discussion think may little better there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think that’s good suggestion. okay
 everybody?
 SEVERAL. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. didn’t think could rewrite press statement
 Committee, did! next meeting December 11, 2001. adjourn lunch.
 END MEETING
