 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Kos.
 MR. KOS. I’ll referring package colored charts

 U.S. short-term interest rates continued decline

 concludes presentation, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. extraordinarily effective, gentlemen. think
 ought pleased coordinated well.
 Let raise questions myself. You’ve raised basic conceptual problems
 think major concern expressed relates fact input data adjusted
 intensity use one form another. You’re working capital stock you’re using
 depreciation important component weights used aggregate capital stocks get
 capital services. You’re all, however, using gross product constant dollars measured
 BEA. Yet know, statistical discrepancy underwent dramatic widening
 protracted period reverse. result, real gross income grew significantly faster
 real gross product period productivity growth accelerating. Many
 conclusions come analysis affected using product-side data rather
 income-side figures. know gross domestic income gross domestic product
 conceptually identical, we’re dealing strictly measurement questions. importantly,
 weight argument data possibly marginally superior product
 
 6/26-27/01
 
 21
 
 side, superiority indeed marginal. Therefore, robust conclusions issues nature,
 least judgment, come data income product
 sides effectively independent types measures used.
 Even get beyond question, also problem
 aware, namely implicit gross product--and fact gross income--data
 structural issues. particular, industry productivity estimates cross-classifications
 industry, corporate versus noncorporate, squeeze data effectively
 produce significant numerical howls, may coin awful metaphor. analysis
 indicates, others, actual declines real output per hour past decades
 significant areas economy, health services, legal services, repair services.
 However, gross product originating data nominal terms areas
 particularly line, suggesting indeed looking important biases
 price indices. course, crucial question whether biases whether
 biases changing. we’re terribly certain.
 cross-classification legal form organization suggests locus
 measurement problem noncorporate sector. So, look productivity
 nonfinancial corporate sector, growth rate shift see pre-1973 post-1973
 period actually significantly less nonfarm business sector. Let’s look
 averages. example, let’s take 1967 l973, strong productivity era,
 compare 1974-1995 period. see table shown Charlie Steindel,
 decline nonfinancial corporate productivity two periods lot smaller
 nonfarm business. Indeed, true manufacturing. obvious inference

 crux whole problem number questions arise respect

 judgment, might useful rerun whole exercise using income-side data
 perhaps substitute unreliable price measures system.
 example, know, people analyze select segments medical services area,
 every study almost invariably shows long-term deflation unit medical costs. use
 aggregate price measures, costs go up. Indeed, one tries infer movement

 price decline. So, lot basic data adjustments called for, order make consistent

 stretch state knowledge terribly far, think it’s useful know raw material
 put system. example, suspect spent good deal time
 capital input data, we’d come lot problems you’re raising, Jeff, Dan
 raising well.
 ultimate question, however, really boils systems work
 forecasting real GDP. truth matter pretty well. you’re concluding
 sense system noise there’s something there. Now, aggregate size

 sure retrospective view anywhere near set numbers shows. Anyway,
 I’ve said piece.
 MR. STRUCKMEYER. Mr. Chairman, may respond?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. means.
 MR. STRUCKMEYER. couple comments. personally like Jeff’s last
 chart. rather viewing vice staff’s approach, think virtue. I’d
 point Okun’s law chart, last exhibit, Chart 5. we’ve used approach
 last year so, really haven’t far forecasts unemployment
 rate. Indeed, use gross domestic income concept Okun’s law, estimated
 similar way way we’ve done potential output product side, Okun’s law fits

 two methods haven’t diverged greatly. may diverge turning points, suggest.
 That’s something haven’t looked so. rate, think method
 served us pretty good stead last year helping us understand really
 going economy keeping inflation output forecasts track
 developments.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Sandy, let ask this. vaguely recall
 used employ Okun’s law estimate potential. start direction work
 backwards, it’s going generate particular relationship.
 MR. STRUCKMEYER. Well, iterative process. [Laughter]
 
 6/26-27/01
 
 24
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. appreciate your-MR. SICHEL. Mr. Chairman, let add one thing income-side numbers.
 addition material presented, done analysis using gross domestic
 income data. tell would produce Chart 3, shows labor
 productivity growth picked 1.5 percent earlier 1973-95 period 2.8 percent
 1995-2000 period, pickup 1.3 percentage points. rerun using gross domestic
 income, pickup would 0.3 percentage point more. So, Chairman said,
 may preference product side wouldn’t strong. one went
 income side, would bit pickup multifactor productivity explain. Indeed,
 Council Economic Advisers way decompositions analysis
 typically average income side product side looking numbers, taking
 agnostic view correct.
 MR. STOCKTON. Mr. Chairman, may make one comment Jeff’s picture
 well? Jeff hinted remarks, doesn’t actually show chart,
 techniques used--and indeed used last summer--were techniques

 errors. fact observing forecasts considerable period

 almost certainly would result kind pattern. recognized, Sandy said,

 investment forecast going create series would move around great deal.
 don’t take movement estimates we’ve seen thus far last year
 necessarily defeat basic approach. proving variable, like forecast,

 indeed reflects record. hand, don’t think necessarily requires us
 put “eyes only” never show anybody. fact, feel quite comfortable
 explaining defending pattern errors Committee people outside
 Committee well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, maybe problem we’re using term
 “productivity” explain you’re explaining use structural model
 forecast certain internal variables determinants level output relatively
 short run. words one uses explain probably really relevant. fact, it’s quite
 conceivable you’re really quite different Jeff doing--that two

 he’s calculating it. measuring phenomenon. You’re measuring
 different phenomenon. It’s almost though 10-year moving average

 MR. STOCKTON. think recognize that.
 MR. FUHRER. that.
 MR. STOCKTON. Also, kinds questions one might want address
 various analyses different. remember President Minehan asking early process

 thinking sense higher frequency notion structural. tried adjust

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. might add parenthetically often show negative
 numbers multifactor productivity. truly mean knowledge form

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, even cyclically adjust it, still get
 negative numbers. would call errors plus knowledge rather way around.
 MR. FUHRER. risk--maybe Chairman speaks me,
 keep mouth shut leave well enough alone--I want try clarify one point.
 don’t think we’re actually far different concept productivity
 might suggesting. would operational matter use simple long-run linear trends
 figure structural productivity. fact, reason believe productivity growth

 absolutely right. question short periods, impute productivity surges
 structural investment bursts may deliver capital services way
 model says would. there’s scope applying judgment adjust
 estimates, I’m applying judgment little differently way Board staff well.
 don’t think we’re quite different terms notion structural productivity.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let raise one final question, really gets
 issue capital stock. capital stock numbers heavily influenced decisions
 spending capitalized expensed written off. Security analysts
 apparently believe writing items increases market value firm. world
 mean capital stock produces income future or,
 extension, productivity future? Therefore, write-offs issue given
 way tabulate capital deepening, effectively eliminating capital stock
 number items written off. Brynjolfsson, example, huge numbers
 applies capital stock grounds items written concurrently
 thus add value firm later date. sure, capital depreciate fast.
 Average depreciation rates lot faster. Nonetheless, capital stock growing
 never quite catch up, get shift multifactor productivity capital
 deepening. Obviously labor productivity invariant relation that. again,
 matter projection purposes. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, I’d like offer couple comments

 28
 
 least, bottom line confidence interval around current estimate
 projection structural productivity growth fairly wide. can’t say papers
 actually narrowed any. Still, it’s useful sense
 numbers constructed, appreciate work.
 might say, though, think it’s worth keeping mind first
 presumably series discussions special topics. sense substitute
 discussions used money targets. began deemphasize money
 targets, usually got discussion longer-term strategy monetary policy
 so-called “Humphrey-Hawkins” meetings. judgment that’s tradition ought
 keep. spirit, think it’s appropriate try draw discussion best

 Now, respect monetary policy strategy, longer set explicit money
 supply targets yet adopted definite substitute that. given
 public commitment long-term price stability, think us implicit target
 ceiling inflation carry around back minds--at least do--and it’s probably
 something like 2 percent core PCE. seems key question
 Committee is: implications changing trend productivity growth rates

 productivity growth doesn’t matter trend productivity growth sustainable
 long-term rate economic growth consistent price stability.
 
 6/26-27/01

 Knowledge trend productivity growth important, least think
 many people, terms giving us estimated range equilibrium real funds rate
 point time, given whatever situation face. We’ve talked many times before:
 higher productivity growth rate, hence faster expected growth future income,
 businesses households going borrow money try bring
 expected higher future income forward; hence higher equilibrium real rate needs
 make people business firms patient wait actual higher income arises.
 staff producing estimates equilibrium real interest rates used formulating
 short-term monetary policy settings. think useful, brings
 question. I’d interested staff ’s estimate much range equilibrium real rates
 change response particular increase trend productivity growth.
 specific, estimates long run much range equilibrium real rates
 needs rise trend productivity growth increases by, say, percentage point? seems
 one basic practical questions need answer help us conducting
 monetary policy.
 MR. KOHN. papers you’ve received years,
 Bluebook time, think hints that. model’s estimates effect
 trend productivity growth r*, real federal funds rate, one-for-one
 big effects demand. supply effects equity prices, expected income,
 expected earnings significant impact demand consumption investment.

 reduction productivity growth. reflected certain extent Charts 6 7

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s question declining output per

 MR. POOLE. One issues try study productivity sector-by­
 sector basis lies difficulties identifying inputs outputs sector sector. think
 Denison’s position one go aggregate level rather try specify
 productivity sector sector; latter ends losing game difficulties
 relating one sector another.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, that’s partially true staff
 addressed question input-output analysis found many measurement
 anomalies industries primarily sell final users. noted earlier, example, one
 problem industries health services; bulk output industry goes
 
 6/26-27/01
 
 32

 way go it--when disaggregate data, really tells something.
 MR. POOLE. I’m getting problem taking aggregate productivity

 MR. POOLE. Right, it’s telling us measures outputs inputs strange.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, actually think different issue we’re

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, I'd like ask authors comment paper
 received John Fernald Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. seems
 inclusion adjustment costs theoretically justifiable inclusion. terms paper,
 certainly results decidedly optimistic view structural productivity going forward.
 would like hear views regarding Fernald’s estimates also implications. must
 admit Dan Sichel’s comment, indicated approach ignore cost
 adjusting capital stock, somewhat unsatisfying me. would appreciate commenting
 paper Fernald.
 MR. SICHEL. Let start. Indeed, standard growth accounting approach doesn't
 take account adjustment costs. usual argument evolved way
 originally approach used looking growth long periods--looking one
 twenty-year segment compared another twenty-year segment. long periods
 time it's presumably reasonable assumption say economy within period
 converged equilibrium adjustment costs worn off. one takes
 analysis higher frequency starts look developments year year, indeed
 
 6/26-27/01
 
 34
 
 possibility adjustment costs would matter becomes important. Certainly
 periods like early ’70s late ’70s large adjustment costs associated
 oil price shocks standard approach doesn't deal well. Accordingly, standard
 approach terribly useful understanding periods.
 Fernald paper, found paper provocative. think, said,
 theoretically makes sense consider adjustment costs, framework Fernald’s paper
 seems right one. believe best job anyone effort estimate
 large adjustment costs are. challenging task parse much
 adjustment cost. firm adjusting capital stock difficult determine much
 involves adjustment desired stock today compared much involves building
 telecom infrastructure, say, put place today won't become productive long
 time. “time build” phenomenon--or lag investment actual
 productive impact felt--can difficult separate adjustment costs. So, think
 paper best job done, task challenging.
 MR. PARRY. Well, think use structural productivity growth
 terms policy, involves shorter timeframe. assumption think
 making--that adjustment cost zero--probably optimal assumption.

 MR. SICHEL. May make brief comment? There’s interesting paper

 MR. MOSKOW. Well, wondering thoughts whether

 MR. STOCKTON. It's hard know exactly closely connected capital

 ways. One, earnings could turn weaker analysts think. Maybe already

 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. David, Chart 5 labeled “Fiscal Policy,” lower
 right-hand corner unified budget surplus fiscal year 2001--for fiscal year,
 three-fourths over--is shown $185 billion. recall seeing day Treasury
 reported surplus month April alone $190 billion. right point

 MR. STOCKTON. I'm sure exactly. You're citing, suppose, monthly

 MR. JORDAN. Yes, standpoint--abstracting fiscal year

 MR. STOCKTON. Probably yes, though I'm quite sure. gauge overall

 MR. KOHN. would say unified budget surplus forecasts Greenbook

 That's excluding autos completely, think, would little one tried make

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. I, too, thought capital overhang paper good. Among
 things, moved knowledge fiber optics 0 1 percent, big increase!

 overhang began open 18 months ago, right around start year 2000. one

 MR. WILCOX. Well, couple elements throw out. One is,

 Overall consumer confidence stabilized May level 20 percent

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, think District's economy weakened since

 respect consumer spending, elsewhere country new car sales
 held surprisingly well, spending non-auto durable goods services weaker
 recently. One board members Richmond retired chairman large department
 store chain receives lot data department store sales. gave information
 days ago store sales first three weeks June indicated even
 corrected promotional programs forth, sales quite weak period.
 Housing activity still looks rather good District markets. New home sales,
 elsewhere country, strong recently new residential permits almost
 10 percent higher year ago. Commercial real estate activity, hand,
 weakened.
 District labor markets loosened overall. Actually, unemployment rates
 bit three jurisdictions--D.C., Maryland, West Virginia. states

 North Carolina unemployment rate moved 3.6 percent last May
 little 5 percent May.
 national economy, think situation face today different

 near bottom second quarter without easing monetary policy.
 course, know, forecast bottoming seems result mainly monetary
 stimulus already pipeline, anticipated additional fiscal stimulus,
 completion least good bit inventory correction end third quarter. That's
 Greenbook point forecast. clearly, tone Greenbook commentary focused
 mostly downside risks outlook. That's entirely appropriate, view, since
 dramatic weakening equipment investment which, anything, could intensifying

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Don, followed Governor Gramlich's comments, trying
 reconcile apparent inconsistency expectation financial markets

 MR. KOHN. Right.
 MR. GUYNN. interpret Chart 1 following page 1 Bluebook correctly,
 markets expect reversal short rates 75 100 basis points beginning early next year.

 might even potential--unemployment may still increasing, inflation, comes,

 may yet shown itself. financial markets trying tell us see degree
 inflationary pressure think would respond preemptively
 kind phenomenon?
 MR. KOHN. Whether they're seeing inflationary pressure real pressure think
 difficult question. remarked noted briefing yesterday,
 it’s hard parse recent rise rates inflation real rates. Although TIPS
 market tends suggest balance since end March bit rise
 inflation expectations, there’s little corroborating evidence that. Governor Gramlich
 noted there’s evidence commodity prices, surveys, behavior
 dollar. all, increase inflation expectations, one would think
 would favorable environment dollar assets. causing pulling
 back investments United States. continued strength dollar--though
 that’s relative really poor performance countries perhaps--does suggest people
 haven’t lost confidence ability Federal Reserve keep inflation contained
 reasonable levels despite TIPS spreads might doing.
 So, markets may well expecting little inflation--a bit
 anticipating months ago expected decline--but probably reflect
 sense activity going bounce back real rates rising. think
 markets expect Federal Reserve respond promptly. You’ve responded promptly-­
 “forcefully” like say--with decline rates. And, gratifyingly, they’ve built
 certain symmetry that. Obviously, number remarked, seem
 optimistic view situation economists inside outside building.
 believe expect begin tighten cut inflationary impulses pretty quickly.

 MR. GUYNN. That’s helpful, thanks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, comment,
 similar said. Financial market participants view
 Committee, reflected rates commentary. Living New York, one sees
 lot people talks them. believe Committee great courage
 convictions. degree credibility Committee extremely high. markets believe
 we’ve far year front-loading easing monetary policy.
 they’re absolutely convinced time comes reverse that, front-load
 correction. think that’s complimentary Committee. share Governor Kelley’s view

 could. view you’re reading markets combination fact
 they’re little optimistic recovery convinced time comes

 MR. GUYNN. hope they’re right.

 6/26-27/01
 
 145
 
 share hope, probably best described fond hope, next meeting issue
 statement risks evened out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. think recommendation right, Mr. Chairman.
 believe early stop easing process altogether, think important send signal
 continuing path on. view proposal
 balances considerations exactly right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. I, too, agree proposal. exactly hoped
 would come meeting. view move 25 basis points, noted,
 signal. also indicates measure confidence part Committee
 central tendency forecasts--that is, bounceback year-end early next year--is
 something level agreement. lot discussion
 economic forecasts financial market’s forecast, think markets telling us
 expect us forward-looking. regard, mentioned, could well
 see data near future weaker been, though perhaps weaker
 expected forecast. live level confidence
 forces think foster pickup end year actually operate.
 think exactly right move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, agree suggestion. must say
 reluctantly one respect would really like stop lowering funds rate level
 
 6/26-27/01
 
 146
 
 right now. downside uncertainty still high psychology still
 fragile, think another, smaller easing move best way go today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, support cut funds rate provide bit
 insurance additional downside surprises. Therefore, would support
 recommendation 25 basis points. also support retaining balance risks statement
 weighted toward economic weakness. mentioned would desirable indicate
 statement something amount easing date. seems addition
 make point cuts significant cumulative impact extends
 beyond near term.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't think actually say
 everybody market knows exactly statement means.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think powerful let draw
 conclusion draw them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support parts recommendation
 well. Governor Kelley's point, don't like volatility funds rate either. would point
 following hard-line monetarist regime demand either money
 goods bouncing around, funds rate would too. doesn't mean funds rate
 volatility desirable think said, Mr. Chairman, sometimes necessary
 conditions change lot. Also, would note follow recommendation, would
 close Bluebook labels “perfect foresight policy.” get
 better that!

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. guess best way put
 disagree strongly recommendation. concerned we’re making little
 much incoming short-run data economy. Early year, know,
 debate whether economy going follow “V” shaped versus “U” shaped
 pattern reacceleration. think we've learned “U” shaped proponents
 turned correct, least far. honest, admit don't
 know long bottom “U” going last. said last meeting,
 patience going called along way here, especially logic policy
 we've easing fairly aggressively think matters. we've got give
 chance see whether fact that's going work not. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree recommendation
 25 basis point cut balance risks toward weaker economic growth I, too,
 hope last move. two major concerns sides issue.
 One I, too, concerned, are, may second phase cycle.
 think low probability view action gives us flexibility keeps
 options open going forward. second concern relates long-term impact inflation
 inflation expectations. think somewhat higher probability. light
 discussion had, said, must willing move rates appropriate,
 downturn stabilizes. someone said discussion--I forget was--the markets
 expecting us move promptly forcibly time comes.

 risks truly evenly balanced. view that's right sort policy horizon.
 incoming data weak, that's forecast certainly don't rule out--none us
 rule out--I think there's ample room markets bring long-term rates down.
 noted, rates come since December. Looking long-term rates, appears
 economy much weaker see, long-term rates easily would room

 building problem future indicating markets, accordance view

 empirical judgment. It's matter logic. It's judgment forecast market
 going react statement. suspect market another 25 basis point decline
 bid September futures, that's testable proposition. fact we're going test

 issue inflation expectations, think important understand--it's
 fortunate, course--that inflation expectations holding steady. That's vote confidence
 Committee. reading whether policy tuned correctly. It's vote

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, preference, would stopped
