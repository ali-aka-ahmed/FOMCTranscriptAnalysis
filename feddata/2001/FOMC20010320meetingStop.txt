 could explain whole issue--is necessarily consistent decline

 Labor market developments also provide evidence District
 economy may stabilizing. Employment continued grow January, latest month

 workers laid hired firms,

 supply labor may tight earlier, labor also appear

 U.S. economy continue grow modestly go forward, view

 Though pace economic activity decelerating, said earlier

 Sorting data impressions, expect economy grow

 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. number made
 point picture mixed. I'm reminded statement old-time baseball
 manager, Paul Richards, made team middle losing streak.
 said, “No team good looks it’s winning bad looks it’s
 losing.” sense statement applied economy. Last
 year economy I’ll call winning streak we--or maybe say
 I--took great pride growth high-tech investment. growth appears
 somewhat excessive so-called overhang high-tech goods may
 leading problems now. year, economy seems losing streak,
 things may weak seem either.
 One gets different picture looking different sources data.
 There's kind hierarchy optimism there. strongest readings come
 labor markets point changes unemployment measures
 labor demand moderate. Using unemployment numbers infer GDP
 growth leads estimated real growth rate quarter 2-1/2 percent. Next
 hierarchy come final demand markets picture mixed. Auto
 spending, know, contracted sharply turned back up. still
 real growth high-tech spending. Housing construction overall consumption
 spending held fairly well. leads estimate real growth
 quarter, I'm guessing, 1/2 1 percent. terrible picture, obviously,
 comes stock market. part difficulty involved interpreting
 determine whether recent declines stock prices stock market phenomenon
 whether foretell deeper real message heeding.
 
 3/20/01

 Greenbook, optimistic side actually find two ways
 baseline forecast negative. First, Greenbook acknowledges,
 monetary assumption underlying forecast Fed cuts rates 50 basis points
 meeting stands pat. fed funds futures market guide,
 likely outcome. futures market funds rate dropping 4.25 percent
 fall, current long-term rates presumably incorporating expectation.
 simulation labeled “easier monetary policy” closely incorporates assumptions
 futures market, outcome simulation slightly positive
 baseline.
 second reason may slightly less bearish staff involves
 wealth effect. We've talked lot morning. concern
 past years stocks rising attributed strong growth
 consumption largely wealth effect. I’m questioning attribution,
 strikes wealth effect working powerfully side. Stock
 values barely higher levels two years ago. wealth-to-income ratio
 declining while, yet consumption still high relative disposable
 income, personal saving rate quarter declining 0.8 percent.
 saving rate may rise extraordinarily low level, staff turning around
 --I would say reasonably sharply--to 1.6 percent end simulation period.
 Basically cheerleader high saving don't necessarily approve

 Greenbook simulation labeled “strong demand.”
 made positive points, still favor easing monetary policy today.
 One reason hardly take solace low federal funds futures rates
 associated long-term rates prepared take steps necessary validate
 expectation. Another reason still very, serious downside risks.
 third reason even optimistic forecasts, unemployment rate
 rises think necessary control inflation. point nobody really
 made yet. Even recession, even economy bottoms slow
 rate growth, personally think still worry growing output gap.
 yes, Cathy, productivity optimist saying that.
 Another way view look funds rate real terms. staff
 done exercise corrects nominal funds rate expected core PCE inflation
 derived regression model. leads estimated current real funds rate
 3.8 percent, close average past five years though still
 average past 15 years. Alternatively, forward-looking calculation
 present real rate 3.8 percent equal tax-adjusted real forward rate

 policy roughly neutral posture right now, feel strongly environment
 leaning downward risks. agree Paul Richards’s
 dictum situation may weak appears, think ought

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think better break coffee else

 [Coffee break]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. baseline Greenbook
 attempts paint would describe middle-of-the-road outlook economy,
 signs--maybe premature--that bottom reached. Indeed, I’ve
 heard others around table say look data myself, it's clear one could
 read incoming information indicating perhaps pace weakening
 economy accelerated. Retail sales light vehicle sales still appear
 holding fairly well. least one survey consumer confidence suggests
 turnaround, though survey taken recent break stock
 market. housing market continues show signs life. finally,
 evidence inventory adjustment, still train, may slackened.
 reason, perhaps, cautiously optimistic.
 said that, number concerns. respect baseline
 forecast, agree point Cathy Minehan made first others picked up:
 seems bit incongruous growth forecast return rate close potential
 yet unemployment rate projected rise somewhat higher number
 think consistent noninflationary growth. share unease others
 felt baseline terms interaction growth,
 unemployment rate, monetary policy assumptions forecast.
 
 3/20/01
 
 69
 
 second point I’d like make certainly hopeful
 economy may reached bottom, shouldn't let hope triumph sense
 reality. Beyond concern baseline forecast itself, concerned,
 others, number downside risks baseline scenario, believe
 eventually demand total policy response greater envisioned
 baseline. One major risks capital goods overhang greater
 Greenbook assumes investment, therefore, slow significantly
 longer period currently anticipated. Greenbook actually states “In
 staff projection, actual desired stocks capital assumed reasonably close
 alignment present time,” implying investment hold well.
 think that's rather bold assumption, given uncertain times.
 relatively simple work underlying models suggests may find
 case. Using reasonable assumptions, model equations indicate
 investment high-tech goods fourth quarter could much 20
 percent higher target levels. standard model parameters could
 easily produce scenario high-tech investment might grow low single digits-below 5 percent--between 2003 2004. David Stockton indicated
 remarks range potential outcomes. Rapidly downshifting profit
 forecasts, combined less accommodative financial conditions declining stock
 market banks tightening terms conditions face monetary easing,
 make slower path investment strong possibility view. may
 likely scenario one reject hand.
 
 3/20/01

 greater concern, obviously, get slowing high-tech
 capital stock growth, would undermine increase productivity we've
 experienced late. could lead even falloff GDP--a result
 think staff appropriately captures productivity slowdown simulation--which,
 judgment, terribly unattractive outcome.
 third risk weakness equity markets might severely
 damaging consumer confidence--and ultimately spending--than case
 date. Many us noted apparent disconnect confidence measures,
 close recessionary levels, actual data spending,
 reasonably strong. disconnect continues, tension resolved yet
 unknowable. Clearly going need data assume
 worst really behind us. Contrary assumption baseline, think risk
 real consumer confidence undermined jittery stock market-which may may soon stabilize--and specter unemployment,
 certainly going get worse gets better. Negative wealth effects certainly
 hold consumption growth year next, making challenge even
 greater. Fed early 1990s confronted banks afraid lend.
 may yet enter period consumers concerned spend.
 outcomes come pass, growth rate GDP would
 well potential several years--too long, judgment. unemployment

 would totally wrong. People real economy might perceive us panic,
 not. Stock market investors might see us trying save them,

 quite difficult eradicate. move would take short-term rates toward

 So, believe 50 basis points best choice asymmetry toward

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
