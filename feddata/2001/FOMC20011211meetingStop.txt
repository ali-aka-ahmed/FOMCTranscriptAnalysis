 longer-term costs involved thinking about?
 MR. STOCKTON. don’t think significant longer-term costs package
 designed. designed package thought sensible--and still think
 it’s quite sensible economic perspective. Whether makes sense politically different
 matter. designed provide stimulus economy next two years without imposing
 long-term budgetary costs. items built in--the temporary investment
 incentive, big effect, one-time sets tax rebates--obviously would go away.

 don’t really see necessarily longer-term budgetary consequences. Now, one could
 certainly imagine something might labeled short-term stimulus economy really
 would impose longer-term budgetary costs. Obviously, kind permanent change either
 spending taxes would feed forward would produce bigger effects long-term interest rates,
 crowding private investment, therefore less capital deepening going forward.
 that’s what’s forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think question related assume

 MR. STOCKTON. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENPAN. presumably that’s suboptimal market point

 MR. PARRY. I’d like ask two short questions. first one Dave Stockton
 perhaps Kohn. Greenbook also Monday morning briefing report
 Michigan survey one-year-ahead inflation expectations, indicating dropped 2.8 percent
 September, 1 percent October, 0.4 percent November, bounced back 1.6
 percent December. seems there’s potentially interesting information there.
 all, we’re much interested happening real federal funds rate.
 wondered data, admittedly volatile still considerably looking
 recent past, influencing views real interest rate far fed funds rate
 concerned?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, certainly, point trying make briefing
 also find interesting. pretty much wrote data dropped
 first two months, thinking completely outside historical experience. inclined
 think fluke. longer decline persisted felt needed least
 consider possibility giving us information drop inflation expectations.
 MR. PARRY. So, don’t think policy easy previously thought?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, maybe want comment well. certainly don’t
 think 2-1/2 percentage point rise real short-term interest rates perceived
 anyone involved spending decisions point. However, survey results might be,

 margin, reading would want take board assessing stance policy--just piece

 setting policy.
 MR. KOHN. certainly agree Dave said. fact long-term inflation
 expectations haven’t changed much would lead one discount survey result bit.
 question would whether implied rise real short-term rates exerting upward pressure

 Dino tried do--why long-term rates risen general optimism plus
 volatility. don’t think, yet anyhow, rise real short-term rates putting upward pressure
 real long-term rates. inflation expectations continue edge lower, would
 something would need take account assessing stance policy.
 MR. PARRY. I’d also like ask Dave Howard quick question. revision

 addition, there’s deflation every quarter 2003. One begin wonder

 there’s much today. intermediate term, growth second
 half next year appears likely relatively strong without requiring action part.

 generating growth noted elsewhere I’ll highlight them.
 Monetary policy, view, accommodative contributing strengthening

 New England seem point weathering recession well preparing stronger

 Turning national scene, certainly equity markets seem think time near

 Finally, Greenbook forecast contain rather sizable amount fiscal

 Moreover, whether federal government acts, state local government spending likely

 Beyond that, latest hard economic data whole rosy view.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m sure lot add point,
 let brief. I’ve reported long time District economy tracking
 national economy rather closely. generalization still case, let make
 comments things little different new.
 Clearly, labor market conditions District eased--that new--but
 unemployment rate actually risen little point. would say, best
 judge anecdotal reports, holiday hiring better anticipated earlier. major
 retailers I’ve spoken seem satisfied far holiday sales--relative subdued
 expectations let add. Nevertheless, complaining inordinately
 seeing. pattern sales evident quite time--with discounters better
 full service department stores specialty apparel people somewhere middle--seems
 continuing, based same-store sales data discussions retailers. large retailers also
 indicate made adjustments capital spending plans next year so.
 History tells cut back, find they’ve done economy starts
 improve wish proceeded additional stores. So, grounds,
 haven’t changed capital spending plans.

 commercial construction activity slowing District, housing activity measured either

 far national economy concerned, I’m confident

 next quarter sustained improvement get way. latest data
 indicate that, nothing else, economy clearly process stabilizing. falling

 I’ve commented before, housing activity measure might consider thinking
 mindset consumer. all, purchase house long-term commitment.
 people willing buy new home, involves 15- 30-year commitment, even
 allowing sales refinancings forth. housing activity numbers continue
 suggest consumer confidence remains reasonably healthy.
 would also note whenever economic activity starts pick up, it’s likely take us
 time recognize upturn unless series turn positive once. experience
 rarely, ever, happens. even economy starts improve second quarter guess
 won’t recognize much confidence third fourth quarter. would think,
 way, unemployment rate going continue go time. seems

 Finally, restrain discuss policy preferences moment.

 [Laughter]
 One interesting developments recession--especially since September 11th--has
 difference compared 1990 behavior perspective households
 businesses. recall, point 1990 Desert Shield leading Desert Storm,
 households businesses seemed go hunkering down, worst case, mini-max mode--an
 “avoid worst outcome” type approach. Households simply done time,
 whereas businesses seem acting much 1990. Everybody business
 Missouri! They’re going believe anything good see order books sales.
 Well, starting point one two things happen: Either households belatedly turn

 necessarily bad thing, either economy trading partners around world.

 can’t forecast interest rates even well people can, I’m fairly confident
 we’re going flatter yield curve year now. Especially Greenbook forecast
 right, see yield curve flattening mostly short end. It’s question get
 there. I’ve puzzled reports expected cut funds rate
 meeting 1/4 1/2 point. people surveyed--and don’t people are--say we’re
 going cut funds rate. One directors government affairs council American
 Bankers Association meeting recently, think beginning last week.
 100 bankers attended and, listening economic briefing, asked indicate whether
 thought Fed lower funds rate meeting today. said one raised hand
 among 100 people there. asked thought Fed already cut rates
 much, said almost everyone raised hand. asked Community Bank Advisory
 Council first question last Friday regular meeting. One banker say thought
 ought cut funds rate 1/4 point today simply already built expectations--I
 guess reads newspaper--and everybody else said no.

 Let make couple comments national economy. lot

 can’t make assumption temporary temporary permanent permanent.
 think better way view fiscal policy right fiscal policy play likely
 
 12/11/01

 play time come. think back early 1990s, stimulus bill--I think
 called investment credit time--was consideration beginning Clinton
 Administration enacted. tax program enacted narrowly.
 that, fiscal policy settled quite long time. began discussed election
 campaign last year. fiscal policy play, think we’re going see continuing discussions
 adjustments. Fiscal policy going source stability outlook. cannot
 expect everything resolved, however stimulus bill comes out. That’s going
 end it, think.
 seems neighborhood cycle trough. don’t know exactly
 means, I’d say means trough occur within next months. That’s consistent,
 course, Greenbook forecast.
 One comment I’d make think it’s clear household behavior
 characterized expectations ongoing deflation. People responding sales incentives
 reason buy rather project better deals available future. Therefore, sales
 incentives leading additional sales rather postponement purchases
 expectation getting even better deal waiting another months. So, that’s take
 current outlook.

 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, let make couple comments may make

 differences situation face today one looking met last month.
 think lot similarities well. November meeting favored 50 basis point
 reduction funds rate, eventually did, favored strongly categorically.
 primarily two factors conditioned thinking. First, didn’t see evidence
 either inflation rising inflation expectations anywhere. second, given high credibility,
 thought would time reverse course, needed to, move rate back up. all,
 1999, least one recent experience able pull off.
 Given two preconditions, thought ought use credibility ease policy
 aggressively reduce risk disinflation might undercut stimulative impact
 reductions nominal funds rate engineered. think two preconditions still
 place view policy risks today much faced last month.
 
 12/11/01

 think need avoid getting situation inflation
 expectations quite low nominal funds rate close zero. That’s so-called zero
 bound problem. It’s difficult get that, think know. don’t want go there.
 discussed earlier meeting, inflation expectations Michigan survey dropped
 quite abruptly last several months whole. think risk zero bound problem
 still us. reason believe persuasive case still made another 50 basis point
 reduction today, using current core PCE rate, 1-1/2 percent, measure
 inflation. would take real funds rate roughly zero. Now, granted, we’ve gotten
 difficulty longer-term past pushed real rate zero--and
 especially evident 1970s. took real funds rate zero 1992--which 50 basis
 point reduction today would put it--and get subsequent increase inflation. still
 think case persuasive view 50 basis point cut best option. recognize though
 tone economic data bit stronger respects places time.
 Therefore argument half point little less compelling today last time.
 choice, think way would go.

 Let quickly sketch elements reasoning. Part touched earlier. think

 course not, think high bar. We’re going know quite time.
 seem recent spate data suggests economy stabilizing.
 data suggest lot market participants expecting that, based way financial assets

 aggressive reductions interest rates, although done that. also rapid

 growth we've money time now. don’t know fiscal policy play out,
 would guess get added fiscal stimulus. it’s certainly true
 reduction rates turns mistake reverse direction needed, it’s possibly

 combination reasons, recognizing perhaps one convincing itself, would

 view great interest statement time, tantalizes us possible way

 I’m pleased see Committee continue practice using two-day

 hope Committee might find worthwhile discuss topic future. Let also note

 Transparency means, view, revealing public objectives drive

 paragraph little better tell coherent story underlies staff forecast. Furthermore,
 particularly extent Committee’s press announcement policy decision becomes
 less revealing, would judgment constructive speed release minutes--perhaps
 third Thursday following meeting, two weeks meeting.
 next set recommendations relates FOMC members’ forecasts,

 forecasts may developed advertised. is, forecast supposed reflect appropriate

 12/11/01

 perfect foresight policy-related material. think Committee members might want discuss
 whether they’re preparing forecast type model not, whether so.
 Second, forecasts view always cover period least one half
 two years. particular, forecast prepared January extends end year,
 forecast prepared June extends one half years. January forecast view
 extended end following year, two-year period. Now, appreciate
 recommendation considered rejected 1994. members Committee
 concerned time extension could allow public infer Committee’s
 objectives! repeat that? mind, advantage. Publishing extended forecast
 might require discussion Chairman monetary policy testimonies perhaps
 Committee members. That’s transparency about.
 Third, ability forecast serve rationale Committee’s decisions
 limited today Committee reveal assumptions underlying consensus
 forecast particular funds rate path. understand especially radical, would
 encourage Committee consider revealing central tendency funds rate path
 underlies consensus forecast. I’d also suggest perhaps looking ways reveal key
 assumptions underlying forecast.
 Finally, I’d encourage Committee consider increasing frequency forecasts

 orderly repositioning policy, think us want do. final thing would say
 policy recommendation that, I’m mistaken, going 1/4 point today would
 following exactly strategy built Bluebook forecast staff imputed so-called
 perfect foresight policy. think would pretty close way they’ve got us equation.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hopefully don’t comment
 transparency I’m going to! agreement recommendation. Given hard
 time 50 basis point reduction last time, might ask could and, frankly,
 case standing pat think President Stern good arguments. view data
 come since last meeting, glimmers turnaround enhanced
 downside risks well. thought covered well statement: trajectory
 unemployment rate, euphoria stock market, potential fiscal policy one that’s
 effective way like forecast, downturns corporate profits, forth. see
 new risks here. agree statement risks biased downside, certainly
 near term. logic, come side 25 basis point decline rates
 suggested. ways think measure insurance fact I’m hopeful
 is. I’m also hopeful positives we’re seeing turn outweigh potential
 negative developments next time meet policy stable risks

 seems eleven months aggressive front-loaded easing
 accommodative stance time now--the degree could argue about--we
 latitude pause today. That’s say declare victory think ought pause see
 things play out. People around table made point we’re likely see
 ugly data next couple months next couple quarters. would argue
 considerable value signaling several things. One seeing first signs--I
 underscore first--of stabilization many adjustments still need made
 particularly interest rate sensitive. finally, done cushion slowdown
 cycle, send message gotten back to--in fact never gotten away
 from--a focus optimum long-term policy. Perhaps statement crafted
 achieve much that, think significant value today making points
 people watch do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman. recovery
 appears track least visible distance. point out, timing magnitude
 recovery depend consumer spending, still uncertain. counter risk
 associated that, support easing. also support leaving risk statement weighted
 toward economic weakness least time. also feel wording press
 announcement particularly important time, look forward seeing craftsmanship.

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, really think ought stay are. 2 percent
 fed funds rate stimulative. We’ve cut rate 450 basis points year, aggressive
 us, 150 basis points done since September 11th. seeing signs
 improvement stimulus come play yet. recognize inflation
 immediate issue, appreciate that, still think need take little longer-run view
 time. So, say agree Gary Stern’s comments.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. support recommendation, although I’d like associate
 comments Gary, Jerry, Jack, Tom. think would good time pause
 real harm would come it. seems would good time signal
 markets can’t get cut every time build one fed funds futures. risk
 statement, since put say risks biased toward downside
 clearly are. Nevertheless, continue feel risk statement every meeting
 serving us well think it’s almost always interpreted one easing move
 go. So, eventually think ought take another look practice. One additional way
 might signal we’re winding language statement fact cut
 25 rather 50 basis points, consider reducing discount rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. might note fact issue come
 general consensus, least among staff, probably would create uncertainty
 otherwise. it’s interesting idea.
 MR. MCTEER. Well, I’ve suggested last two meetings well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m aware that.
