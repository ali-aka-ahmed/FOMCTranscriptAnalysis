 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would also suggest combine comments
 questions. Members feel inhibited remarks, thinking
 point ask questions. That's unlikely work event.
 President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. I’d like comment, Mr. Chairman. want make
 pitch trying arrange Treasury way us stay investing
 Treasury securities only. take minutes this, I'll try keep
 remarks brief can. view really important issue goes heart
 institutional position government also ability conduct monetary
 policy effectively longer run.
 would begin remarks suggesting think fortunate
 years able pursue “Treasuries only” policy--or least
 approximately Treasuries only--for long. Beebe/Cumming study recognizes,
 Treasuries policy alone among alternatives considered
 suggested issue satisfies four principles laid paper
 respect guide portfolio selection. policy would allow us
 maintain instrument independence, minimize credit allocation distortions relative
 prices, maintain essential liquidity credit quality, provide appropriate
 transparency accountability.

 would underscore benefits Treasuries follows: Monetary
 policy basically determines quantity monetary base byproduct

 Treasuries only, see it, allowed government whole implement
 monetary policy essentially buying back interest-bearing government debt
 replacing liability central bank. Consequently, key point,
 neither Fed government whole matter invest
 private assets conduct monetary policy make potentially difficult choices
 among private assets might made consider alternatives.
 Now, course, face situation outstanding stock Treasury
 debt may disappear. think presents Fed huge problem
 alternative approaches available us--that is, assets considered-will involve us one degree another decisions allocating credit across
 particular sectors private economy. may recall March

 would continue issue debt Fed buy order replace maturing debt already
 balance sheet provide secular growth monetary base. Note here,
 think important point, debt would costless Treasury
 since would remitting Treasury interest debt would buy.
 question short-term cyclical needs increases monetary base would still
 remain, might would need satisfy needs purchasing liquid,
 low-risk private assets form, say, RPs. since acquisition private assets
 case would self-reversing relatively limited size, would involve
 Fed minimally credit allocation. don't think would raise kinds issues
 concerns fundamental change would.
 Now, know first hear proposal seems eminently
 dismissible. [Laughter] lot questions come lot objections raised,
 already cited those. let address couple them.
 first question is: Isn't proposal way Fed shift
 burden investing private assets, new world,
 Treasury? Well, proposal would respect integrity fiscal
 policymaking process leaving fiscal decisions fiscal authorities, Congress
 Treasury, would protect Fed's independence. key point here,
 though, government wouldn't accumulate assets revenue
 would get selling securities Fed. would simply revenue
 government gets seigniorage tax--that is, act creating money--and
 think that's important point. government could use revenue permanently
 reduce taxes increase expenditures. covers one question.
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 10
 
 second question, closely related first, whether government
 whole shouldn't take advantage least relative political independence
 Federal Reserve let us acquire assets make choices among private
 assets. Presumably, would subject less potential political interference
 parts government. question think likely asked people
 feel independence secure rather people like think inherently
 fragile. view answer question answer first
 question. necessary government acquire private assets permanently
 order conduct monetary policy. doubt many people around table would
 think it's good idea, face it, government buy hold private
 assets. not, believe wary letting Fed instrument
 that. that's one reasons think need adopt Treasuries
 proposal seriously.
 alternative approaches like expanded use
 discount window discussed Craig Hakkio Rick Lang paper,
 expanded use RPs short-term liquidity purposes meet secular
 need increases base? Let make comments those.
 respect discount window loans, first blush appears
 attractive alternative. authority without seeking new legislation expand
 use window implementing monetary policy. principle could
 increase discount window lending relatively small amount that's
 books several hundred billion dollars. Presumably, think Craig’s Rick’s
 paper recognizes, would need restrict lending banks CAMEL ratings

 prudent fraction bank's capital would want back loans good

 would profound change way things. would make Fed
 major, continuous creditor hundreds depository institutions instead infrequent

 view would put us difficult situation.
 Presumably, would want portfolio public knowledge. think
 transparency essential establishing accountability portfolio. hard
 see would forced make portfolio transparent went
 direction. situation pulled loan deterioration bank's
 condition, action would signal publicly bank significant difficulties.
 Currently don't publicize CAMEL ratings, would fairly radical change
 supervisory approach safety soundness. Hypothetically, even didn't make
 composition loans public, seems inevitable pulled loan
 sizable institution, markets would quickly detect it. real worry
 situation would unwilling pull loan. Worse, troubled banks would tend
 replace lost uninsured funding discount window loans, happened
 historically. happened today’s world. since loans would backed
 much bank's good collateral, would greatly increase exposure FDIC-and potentially taxpayers--to losses bank ultimately fails.
 
 1/30-31/01

 sum, greatly expand discount window lending, put
 even middle contentious issues surrounding potential
 resolution problems troubled bank. We've happen historically.
 go kind approach, think spades. kinds difficulties
 could encounter regime would bad enough case individual troubled
 bank, could quite damaging faced kind general banking crisis.
 think could threaten independence ability conduct monetary policy
 independently. believe dealing portfolio problem expanding
 discount window lending would mistake.
 Let turn RPs finished. appreciate patience.
 Expanding use RPs would raise issues expanding discount
 window lending would raise. RPs self liquidating, would allow us exit
 problem bank situations quietly arise. could RPs wide
 variety assets appropriate haircuts. first blush looks RPs might
 way go. expanded use RPs support secular growth monetary
 base distinctly different use RPs deal short-run problems
 mentioned earlier. use long-term way would still problematic, think.
 First, RPs would raise fewer obvious credit allocation issues
 alternatives considered, time good chance
 political pressures System would adjust change. could find
 dealing political problems credit allocation issues respect RPs
 well alternatives table here. Beyond this,
 though, one less obvious think important problem RP
 
 1/30-31/01

 alternative--namely, precisely desirable properties RPs
 listed, pay relatively low return. Remember situation return would
 government’s revenue money creation. went RPs
 nice properties Fed’s standpoint, essentially would limiting
 government’s revenue money creation. essence, would using large part
 revenue buy liquidity services protect ourselves--the Fed, is--from
 credit price risk, thereby denying rest government use funds
 whatever purposes wanted use them.
 last point, view, answer one objection mentioned
 study Treasuries proposal. concern Treasury
 would us favor sense allowing us continue Treasuries
 approach, would demand sort quid pro quo. Now,
 understood perhaps arguably feasible alternative Treasuries only, namely
 RP alternative, would costly government, would narrow
 budgetary interest fiscal authorities prefer stay Treasuries
 approach. instance quid pro quo wouldn’t necessary. said that,
 recognize arguing point getting across others elsewhere
 government would challenging. mind it’s valid point think
 try make it.
 Well, basically argument appreciate patience. Let list
 quickly four main points I've tried make. First, need Fed
 government acquire private assets, except maybe temporarily, implement monetary
 policy. Second, believe feasible Fed follow Treasuries policy

 Third, wouldn’t cost government anything provide debt Fed buy.
 Finally, respect RP alternative, government would forgo revenue

 Let note one good things present system, especially

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First all, I’d like say
 papers really outstanding advanced thinking along quite
 distance. specific reactions points raised papers broad
 reactions questions asked. Let start saying certainly agree
 principles outlined Beebe/Cumming paper. those, maintaining
 independence important principle; agree Al Broaddus that.
 addition, subsidize sector economy individual
 institutions.
 said read papers, whatever decision,
 asset class set institutions benefit action. know that. matter
 tradeoffs, Bill McDonough said. Since segment private sector
 beneficiary rather U.S. government, case, think decision
 serious implications independence. addition, may directly
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 21
 
 indirectly end affecting relative asset values allocation credit across
 institutions sectors economy.
 So, given guiding principles, proceed choosing asset
 composition System’s balance sheet primary issue. three
 implications principles want mention quickly go
 little detail. First, think conduct outright purchases U.S. government
 securities long possible; totally agree that. Second, think
 avoid outright purchases private sector security. concerned putting
 balance sheet asset issued ultimate private sector borrower would
 compromise independence would appear subsidizing particular
 sector institution. Currently U.S. government important ultimate
 borrower balance sheet. third point deal strong financial
 intermediaries rather ultimate private sector borrowers. Financial
 intermediaries put “green space,” use term, ultimate
 borrower us. basically would prefer securities balance sheet
 issued financial intermediaries rather securities issued ultimate private
 sector borrowers. using intermediaries one step removed allocating
 credit.
 views implications would lead following incremental
 strategy. First, I’d increase self-imposed limits holdings Treasury
 securities. recognize limits originally imposed order minimize
 likelihood would affect relative asset prices. given strong preference
 hold Treasury securities rather anything else, would accept may affect
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 22
 
 asset values--that’s part tradeoff. Second, I’d consider outright purchases
 GNMA mortgage-backed securities. GNMA securities backed full faith
 credit U.S. government, would avoid outright purchases Fannie Maes
 Freddie Macs. Third, I’d begin process necessary implement ACF, auction
 process loans. ACF would dealing strong financial
 intermediaries. Also ACF similar RP loan rate determined
 open market auction. Unlike RP asset balance sheet loan strong
 depository institution, actual security used RP. finally, ACF would
 allow financial markets time develop benchmark security without
 indirectly influencing decision. realize may fact problem
 institutions, don’t think would triggering public knowledge that.
 That’s publicly disclosed now. It’s part market discipline.
 written agreements. don’t think triggering public disclosure problem
 credit situations redirect lending assets involving problem credit.
 fourth, would continue use RPs currently--that is, means hit
 intended fed funds rate target daily basis. would use RPs increase size
 portfolio; I’d use auction that. Using RPs primary means increase
 size portfolio would permanently put private assets balance sheet, contrary
 principles.
 trying see would move toward process--and dismiss
 Al Broaddus’s proposal think it’s interesting--this incremental approach
 would follow. believe would allow us achieve orderly transition,

 set forth. Thank time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let say think ought stipulate

 intermediary. And, although we’re large, Vice Chair points out,
 act intermediation change level interest rates, even though probably
 don’t change spreads private public securities significant way.
 think crucial issue one raised Vice Chair--how significant it?

 MR. HOENIG. goal sense try get transition
 without shocking system move toward holding different types assets. That’s
 prefer incremental approach, takes us series assets
 might hold increasing, extent feasible, amount current

 ACF raises issues need dealt with. I’d hate move toward

 MR. SANTOMERO. also want thank people put together

 Let try restrict comments moment two points seem
 central whole issue. two points question risk Fed’s

 Notwithstanding President Broaddus’ perspective, think Fed

 case, assets going carry credit risk counterparty risk, both.
 key Fed ensure appropriate risk monitoring risk management
 systems place deal type risk SOMA portfolio.
 know, concept new. financial sector whole building risk
 management systems last 5 10 years monitor manage risks, it’s
 also new Federal Reserve System itself. already place process
 developed Subcommittee Credit, Reserves, Risk Management (SCRRM)
 System’s discount window borrowing, think would need set
 something monitor aggressively regard credit counterparty risk.
 It’s rather straightforward extend type risk management procedures already
 exist Wall Street certain extent Fed. Nevertheless,
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 31
 
 remember Fed impose high quality standards counterparties
 assets places portfolio practice, operational level,
 risk exposure set low level.
 Holding aside moment issue whether operate certain
 specific asset categories, quality equivalents seem sensible top two
 grades ratings, whether we’re using CAMEL Moody’s ratings. outright
 transactions assets acceptable principle, RPs additional
 security. two main creditors also allow us somewhat
 distant individual issues. Mortgage-backed securities attractiveness
 reason: involve backing one party and, therefore,
 sense secure less subjective. RPs mortgage-backed securities also
 attractive don’t involve direct purchases debt individual firms

 probably face that.
 Turning second issue, discount window, think notion nonadministered credit facility nonstarter. contrast, auction credit facility may

 it. Whether we’re talking eventual size $200 billion $40 $50 billion,
 I’d start $1 billion, get mechanics working, see goes.
 number reasons think actually seems logical. First,
 depository institutions sense competitors direct market borrowing
 GSEs implicitly supporting go non-Treasury debt.
 expanding way provide credit depository institutions expand use
 debt instruments open market seems help level playing field.
 believe it’s useful way proceed. RPs and/or outright holdings different types
 debt going among alternatives replacing Treasuries,
 perhaps need way broadening Fed’s capabilities provide credit
 depository institutions well. Another element hasn’t mentioned
 find rather intriguing also help level playing field within banking
 sector itself. Large small banks fact enter market obtain funds,
 going pro-competitive. Many banking community talk need
 funding base, would give smaller institutions opportunity participate
 standard procedures local Fed manner would fact increase
 capability compete larger institutions.
 end day, ACF nothing alternative mechanism

 different, many respects ACF we’re providing funding much
 way would commercial paper repos instruments

 One thing might today eliminate nonstarters. first candidate

 MR. GRAMLICH. We’ve disagreed doubt again.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. ask Secretariat make alteration!
 [Laughter] got right first time.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Meanwhile, back ranch! There’s also point
 raised early comments think important, dwindling
 supply Treasury securities social value that? better
 dwindling supply securities System portfolio better private
 sector hold them? think it’s better private sector.
 good reason view get started thinking even actually
 to, supply Treasury securities diminishing.
 Let say quick word discount facility. I’ve pushing
 Lombard, know. reading staff documents, think like ACF
 even better. also believe, I’ve confirmed authors studies,
 reason Lombard ACF could coexist. We’re going
 thinking restructure whole discount facility, maybe
 good opportunity that. One aspect that, alluded
 studies dealt directly, role boards directors
 Reserve Banks. discussions discount window, discovered
 views vary widely across System regarding role directors.
 reformulate discount facility ACF Lombard-type facility along
 it, role boards directors would become clear. letters
 boards Reserve Banks write us would relate views overall
 monetary policy, opposed particular facility 1,000 loans
 made 1999. think would involve huge social benefit would benefit
 
 1/30-31/01

 within System well, see positive development. role
 boards directors would become far important, less important.
 Lastly, would like support Gary Stern feeling getting

 some. I’d like mention ones don’t feel strongly ones do.
 comment leads feel emphasizing diversified
 approach going forward, think diversification two ways. One
 terms percentage portfolio relates influence

 think, liquidity issue we’ve talked here. papers written

 market. Actually, believe cuts way well. enter market
 specific security, would encourage others issue securities
 central bank market. think liquidity may increase well, long
 supply elastic.
 Clearly, would prefer use government securities only, would.
 start going beyond that, think GNMAs good first step. personally
 would want go forward Fannie Mae Freddie Mac issues reasons

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Many points Michael
 Moskow made similar I’d like make. I’d start saying material
 certainly provides lot us digest would assume we’re beginning
 dialogue lot issues. Also, feel though probably would benefit
 others besides room examine issues. proposal
 made Bill Poole variants intriguing.
 Let make couple points. unique, reflect
 present time issue. First all, near term certainly
 think reliance Treasuries greatest extent possible desirable. leads
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 49
 
 suggest ought discussion self-imposed limits holding
 Treasuries least assure limits effect present time
 ones want retain going forward.
 also intrigued idea considering outright purchases GNMAs,
 although certainly involve technical complications associated mortgage
 repayments forth would addressed. I’m favor expanding
 use GSE obligations. regard RPs, think room
 expanding collateral accept. would say, though--and different
 President Moskow’s view--that I’m little concerned would like hear
 using foreign collateral. would expose us sovereign risk would, assume, put
 us delicate position choose countries sanction, speak.
 I’m sure understand process would accomplished.
 Finally, find ACF proposal intriguing. I’m sure extent
 ACF could used productively, it’s something ought look little
 closely probably role could play. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve learned enormous amount

 One thing haven’t pursued talking alternatives

 also strongly suspect, even given presumed sanctity Social Security

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. comment
 round?
 MS. MINEHAN. wanted make additional comment found
 interesting point you, Governor Kelley Bill Poole raised
 interim period 8 10 years, however long might be. I’m thinking
 combination greater potential than, say, time last year, Social
 Security funds invested private assets. may happen year next year,
 could well given serious consideration Administration
 Congress. Social Security Trust Fund holds nonmarketable securities.

 whatever guidelines set legislation changes Social Security works?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think it’s best context think
 Social Security Trust Fund nonexistent. It’s intra-governmental transfer.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, realize that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENPAN. That’s best way look terms Al
 Broaddus’ suggestion. Let’s take two examples RPs asset side: RPs limited
 private RP securities RPs involving government securities. we’d really
 doing, leave fiscal policy alone, shifting assets one government
 sector other. words, would swapping RPs Social
 Security Administration U.S. Treasury--it doesn’t matter one--and
 effectively would end U.S. Treasuries asset side balance
 sheet would end private securities.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. view it’s useful think
 alternatives flow sense balance sheet sense swapping assets.
 discussed around table today best judged manner.

 neither us make them, sort thing think

 MR. FISHER. That’s difficult political issue would prefer
 others--perhaps live District--comment. market matter, don’t
 view major challenge, given reasonable time period work out.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay. Well, Committee process standpoint, often
 issues like found start something, burden proof
 think good idea want stop quite formidable.
 sometimes serves purpose, get consensus objectives
 road, reverse burden say stop unless somebody proves
 continue benefits outweigh costs.
 MR. FISHER. Let see read clearly. don’t want put words
 mouth, want sure understand. You’re envisioning going forward
 foreign sovereign municipal securities part RP book--putting aside
 issue volume--and setting forward date getting Fannie Freddie straight
 debt mortgage-backed securities RP book, right?
 MR. JORDAN. Yes, that’s conditioned finding foreign sovereigns
 satisfactory purposes.
 MR. FISHER. think that’s feasible set. would option
 consider. I’m sure know enough determine whether feasible and,
 therefore, whether would want set forward date now. That’s part
 exploratory nature authority we’re looking “B.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s always emphasize we’re talking

 continued tighten even recession begun, either inflation
 particular problem recognition deteriorating state overall
 economy slow occur--or combination factors.
 So, find asking three questions: recession?
 long downturn--or whatever call it--last? right policy
 response?
 First, recession now? Bank’s academic advisory council met last
 week, Jim Stock Ray Fair discussed model-based answers question
 Paul Samuelson others based views insights gained long
 experience. consensus probability recession
 
 1/30-31/01

 Fed may placing much emphasis economic impact movements
 stock markets. assessment relatively low probability recession
 currently way similar Greenbook's forecast. expect
 first quarter 2001 quite slow even slightly negative, pickup that.
 I’ve also come view whether we’re recession right
 probably irrelevant. Last year time real GDP growing pace nearly 5
 percent private domestic final demand rising rate 9 percent.
 Greenbook right first quarter 2001, real GDP growth
 zero close it, growth private domestic final demand 1-1/2
 percent. average drop GDP peak trough nine postwar recessions
 2-1/2 percentage points. even turns we’re
 recession, surely feels are.
 Second, soon downturn over? Greenbook Bank's
 forecast suggest slow first half pickup second half year. would
 short downturn, least postwar history, despite fact peak-totrough GDP drop would fairly large. several reasons case
 period may seen recession fullness time. First, inflation
 problem, amount earlier policy tightening timing
 working greatly exacerbate extend slowdown. fiscal situation good
 nationally locally, government spending source support.
 inventory overhang seems small relative earlier periods. Construction spending
 
 1/30-31/01
 
 133
 
 overdone expansion banking sector remains source
 strength. Finally, major foreign economies--indeed world general--are basically
 good shape, Japan notwithstanding, provide support well. Thus,
 slowdown sharp, reason believe short.
 Third, appropriate policy response? That’s obviously topic
 discussion later, think couple observations relevant now. I’m struck
 absence upside risks Greenbook scenarios. Inflation rises

 unemployment jumps 1 percentage point even strongest scenarios.
 range possibilities, definitely move decisively prepared

 economic activity suggest slowing continues and, like Board's staff,
 marked outlook near-term growth. also like staff, longer

 Currently, though, cyclical slowdown. Weakness economy
 likely broad-based. Consumption, especially durable goods expenditures,
 business fixed investment continue soften. Residential housing tread water,
 suspect, low mortgage rates help prop demand. inventory investment,
 we’ve already noted, softening noticeably. Incoming inflation data confirm trend
 moderate inflation pressures. Given economy slowing, energy price
 increases showing signs unwinding, inflation expectations remain
 well anchored, inflation could ease some.

 Let also take minute talk risks. I’ve said, think

 decline further. Softer aggregate demand depressing effect business fixed

 Turning national perspective, incoming data tend confirm views

 Let start reviewing discussed earlier give us little

 indicated extraordinary pickup number high-tech areas could
 realistically projected continue.
 noted before, demand broad range products hightech area may doubling annually, supply increasing even faster.
 consequence, industry experienced glut eroded prospective profitability
 even though underlying demand moving rapid pace. goodly part

 inventory adjustment appears far faster expected,
