 labor market developments pose least two significant downside
 risks. First, obviously, rising unemployment could undermine consumer confidence creating
 doubts job security. mentioned job security, Dave; actually think downside risk
 rising unemployment could broader constrains real wage income
 growth. Second, labor market slack may foster disinflation, would increase real funds
 rate. Indeed, already evidence disinflation works—for example, data
 core PCE. November 2000 November 2001, core PCE increased
 1.6 percent; period since then, six months, risen rate
 0.6 percent. 1 percentage point disinflation persist, would eventually translate
 1 percentage point increase real funds rate, things equal. Moreover,
 interplay slack labor markets rising productivity compounds disinflation risk
 view. Productivity grew 5½ percent annual rate fourth quarter apparently
 extraordinary 8½ percent rate first quarter. Much that, we’ve discussed, undoubtedly
 cyclical won’t persist. Nonetheless, strong growth measured productivity
 suggests underlying trend may 2½ 3 percent average annual rate

 facing situation productivity growth remains high enough relation wage growth
 cause unit labor costs fall persistently going forward, view would
