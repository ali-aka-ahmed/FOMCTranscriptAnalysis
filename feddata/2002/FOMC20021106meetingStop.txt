 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. number people already
 discussed weakness incoming data, step-down growth H1 H2
 fact forecasters marked near-term intermediate-term outlooks. I’ll
 attempt elaborate points. Rather, I’d like focus minutes two
 assumptions think important baseline Greenbook scenario give
 concern.
 
 November 6, 2002
 
 65 122
 
 First, baseline assumes forecast period investment pick up.
 course recognize, Dave Stockton said response Cathy Minehan’s question,
 number businesses clearly investing elements business fixed investment; real
 investment equipment software indeed positive. However, several reasons
 questioning whether level investment increase intermediate term. One
 really don’t know degree capital goods overhang cannot take granted
 statement Greenbook authors make early capital stock really closer
 firms’ desired levels. staff well recalls, years ago attempted find answers
 question and, believe work well done, conclusion would say
 definitive.
 Another reason doubting intermediate turnaround investment, least
 respect manufacturing sector, obviously capacity utilization relatively low,
 relationships investment capacity quite clear.
 third reason doubts forecast bounceback
 investment built Greenbook baseline know business fixed investment,
 particularly equipment software, driven two separate forces—one substitution
 effect one income effect. substitution effect, based fact price
 capital come relative labor, would lead businesses naturally want substitute
 capital labor. explanation, one would expect find negative correlation
 employment growth investment growth. There’s also income effect, think we’ve
 talking implicitly here; uncertainty respect outlook may indeed hold back
 businesses terms making new investments.
 
 November 6, 2002
 
 66 122
 
 asked staff perform simple test correlations see negative
 positive—that say substitution effect income effect—was stronger. turned
 long periods time, including post-1995 period, positive correlation
 increases employment increases investment strong, indeed statistically
 significant. reason raise technical point relates implicit assumption many
 comments fact outlook respect profitability, growth, et cetera,
 important business people’s thinking. Indeed, turns statistically case.
 since outlook really quite murky, surprising taken time
 investment pick up.
 fourth reason concern investment built baseline
 forecast already noted, many corporations cost capital
 become lower intermeeting period. Indeed, become higher. addition that,
 see survey senior loan officers demand loans, banks least,
 tepid. attributed large part reduced capital expenditures lower
 planned expenditures. least concern baseline
 investment side.
 I’m equally skeptical respect consumption side number reasons.
 One income tax reductions 2001 tax legislation part already
 played out. forecast add think 0.1 percent GDP growth 2003 2004.
 Second, mortgage refinancings, still high, show tendency inversely related
 changes mortgage rates level rates. mortgage rates continue
 come down, might support continuing wave refinancings
 recent high level. finally, others indicated, may reasons interpret
 
 November 6, 2002
 
 67 122
 
 recent round auto incentives differently, response incentives
 encouraging earlier rounds. One might add waning consumer confidence.
 put together say personal forecast, though I’m professional
 forecaster, would put weight alternative scenario involving weaker aggregate
 demand opposed baseline. scenario takes baseline makes it,
 mind, look much worse. Now, unlike Governor Kohn, seek indulgences. go
 discussion reserved second half meeting. encourage Committee
 look another alternative Greenbook, lower funds rate forecast.
 [Laughter] think that’s consistent rules.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. speak! Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. won’t belabor evidence present
 day weakness, let look ahead ask think important question. is,
 going drive economy? late 1990s investment; recently
 consumption housing. What’s next? can’t find much. Consumption held well
 now, evidence collapse lies around us. Auto sales high August
 dropped sharply September October. Non-auto consumption spending strong
 July barely grown since then. Consumer confidence dropped sharply
 wealth-income ratio, kicking consumption functions right now. Personal saving rates
 beginning long anticipated rise. Housing, too, held well now, staff
 forecast drop next year largely stock adjustment considerations.
 Fiscal policy could provide expansionary boost, indeed one hear fiscal
 policy accommodative. one really hear fiscal policy used
 accommodative; it’s particularly now. staff computes measure fiscal impetus
 
 November 6, 2002
 
 68 122
 
 federal budget, cyclically adjusted, budget component weighted likely
 impact spending. measure rose peak spending increases tax cuts
 first half year dropped back three-quarters way toward neutrality,
 stays roughly end forecast period. Fiscal policy restrictive,
 it’s nearly expansionary was; everybody knows state local level
 budget policies quite restrictive year.
 Conceivably exports could provide boost expansion, doesn’t appear
 likely either. staff projecting foreign output growth less forecast
 period. export income elasticity 1, exports best neutral factor.
 Perhaps impetus demand come business fixed investment; may
 eventually, it’s likely happen soon. Real business fixed investment slated
 drop every quarter 2002 beginning grow next year. terms forecast
 next year, sobering go back check Greenbook forecasts business fixed
 investment; they’ve steadily lowered fairly large amounts since last March.
 None changes fundamental economics picture. capital
 overhang developed, capital investment spending expected weak while,
 length depth slowdown would depend well types spending filled
 gap. Housing filled gap admirably now. Consumption filled late summer.
 Fiscal policy helped while. investment comes back, seems nothing
 drive economy point. Hence, seems quite reasonable forecast, staff does,
 continuation output gaps, slowly rising unemployment, slowly falling inflation. Whether
 continued high levels unemployment possible early onset deflation
 worrisome, leave listener decide.

 Much commentary would considered radical short time ago

 Inversions come various types market imperfections changes

 key link higher permanent rates inflation. simply hard see
 modest monetary expansion point could generate much inflation. Moreover, even cuts
 short rates lower long rates bit—as may, given present low levels long
 rates—that bit may quite important. Long-lived assets common stock investment

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Let make two general points. First, conversations bankers
 surveyed past week, almost everything picked anecdotally supports update
 Dave Stockton gave us. Second, would say flavor anecdotes along
 lines Cathy Minehan, among others, described well. I’d like go
 couple points pick up.
 One bankers talked automobile finance subsidiary nine states
 East Coast; nine states, sales new vehicles across board.
 attributes fact spate aggressive financing deals fact exhausted
 appetite new car purchases. view banker contacts, strength we’ve

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. surprisingly,
 think you’re right, let explain why. seems it’s clear
 discussion around table need take insurance downside risks
 Greenbook forecast everybody else’s forecast heard. one taking insurance
 downside risks, one take amount insurance appropriate; 25 basis
 points simply enough. First all, immediate market reaction 25 basis points slanted
 toward weakness would Committee composed bunch wimps,
 attractive assessment group supposed important public body.
 second, market would immediately crank assumption another 25 basis points either

 destabilizing right thing one move today. would say we’d go
 statement balanced risks? Well, taking insurance downside risks we’re
 about, think is, whole purpose balance risks. 50 basis points
 right number, balance risks. isn’t right number, use bigger
 number, don’t think necessary. 50 basis points balance risks
 toward weakness, first place think would wrong. second place, would scare
 hell everybody. assure you, man New York, there’s anything
 I’m certain many years markets, would scare them; would
 very, unwise.
 Now, think legitimate question go 50 basis points balanced risk
 statement is, tie hands? don’t think so. certainly doesn’t tie hands fact

 everybody would cheer, starting us. certainly doesn’t tie hands direction.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. think Vice Chairman’s description virtues

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also support you. Let give
 reasons. First, given we’ve seen terms incoming data, marking

 last meeting. look visually adjust exhibit 2 Vincent’s handout,
 top bottom charts suggest 50 basis points best way that. That, think,
 picks Jerry Jordan implying perhaps others well. Second, balance

 think worthwhile publishing study. anyone objections that?
 SEVERAL. No.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. assume it’s Committee’s judgment

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Vincent mentioned study goes public would
 cover memo foreword. think would helpful note changing way lot

 might looking manage differently. think least ought acknowledge
 Lombard facility going introduced. wasn’t around Committee discussion

 MR. REINHART. Right. include foreword also first

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Chairman, unrelated fact lot

 staff unnecessarily.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There’s also interesting question relationship
 Ginnie Mae study reasons study. Remember, started
 presumption we’d shortage Treasury securities.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. worthwhile discussion

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Exactly. That’s think worth

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. agree Vice Chairman’s recommendation. seems
 acquiring Ginnie Maes natural extension we’re now. already buy full

 think also may useful pilot project learning outsource functions,

 also think ACF work terrific, ACF lot appeal. we’ve put

 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, still think best substitute Treasury securities

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody else?
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, would agree Ginnie Maes first

 MS. MINEHAN. Ginnie Maes, mean?
 MR. FERGUSON. Let make one point. agree others said
 leaving tough judgments staff make. contingency issue,
 however, invested lot contingency planning, don’t think there’s reason
