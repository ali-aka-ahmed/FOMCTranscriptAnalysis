 anyth, 1970s relationship went wai, peopl
 sai look though got high inflat also high level

 nevertheless, number economist weren’t go give phillip

 i’m go assert whatev measur us, we’re go find

 let turn question author, atkeson ohanian, pose

 question whether nairu-base model better, page 11 provid

 mr. moskow. thank you, mr. chairman. articl minneapoli fed

 come minneapoli fed studi confid—whether want us

 stabl relationship, you’re face quit bit uncertainti. point out, success
 rate predict turn point 70 percent. don’t know that’s high enough.
 go tell congress next year we’re 70 percent sure inflat go declin?
 good enough? would think we’d want success rate closer 90 95 percent we’d
 want relationship stabl. i’m sure, given evid have, would
 confid either type metric—that is, measur inflat turn point.
 still lot work done abl argu could confid predict
