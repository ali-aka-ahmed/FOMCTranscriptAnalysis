 Nevertheless, number economists weren’t going give Phillips

 that’s find. see page 7, so-called new Phillips curve

 inflation down. inflation becomes predictable policy becomes
 predictable, longer appears NAIRU tells us much
 inflation going.
 So, I’ve noted page 8, first point Phillips curve
 stable. might quarrel this. I’ve taken simple views
 Phillips curve; might take sophisticated views. might use
 unemployment; might want use broader measure economic activity.
 I’m going assert whatever measure used, we’re going find
 problem period. tried look more-sophisticated Phillips
 curves, found stable period.
 Let turn question authors, Atkeson Ohanian, pose
 directly. economists still insist Phillips curve may stable enough
 unemployment, therefore, still useful predicting inflation.
 authors suggest test, test raises question: NAIRU-based

 shown page 10, definition simply naïve model one
 inflation next period predicted equal inflation previous
 period—not high hurdle obviously unsophisticated model.
 question whether NAIRU-based models better, page 11 provides
 picture view answer, “no.” compare naïve model
 NAIRU-based Board staff model—and also Philadelphia Fed’s Survey
 Professional Forecasters, think NAIRU-based—and one see
 predictions roughly same. went evaluate host NAIRUbased models, including many based work done Mark Watson James Stock

 authors looked large assortment models—132 them—to

 Page 12 conveys basic idea underlying method evaluation. better

 measure success model, then, ratio average error NAIRUbased model versus average error naïve model. NAIRU model wins
 measure less 1. loses it’s greater 1. it’s direct test,
 would argue it’s high hurdle. authors take look Stock
 Watson generalized versions 132 different NAIRU-based models compute

 You’ll see page 13—and chart needs explanation—how NAIRU
 models did. we’ve done show range ratio. Again,
 ratio 1, NAIRU model losing. Take record respect
 models’ predictions core CPI, example, one inflation variables

 NAIRU models lower average forecast errors? answer none.
 ratio 1. authors looked forecasts CPI
 found one two NAIRU-based models actually tied performance
 naïve model. looked PCE deflator could find one NAIRU-based
 model well predicting variable naïve model. So,
 looking performance variety NAIRU-based models forecasting three
 different major indicators inflation, NAIRU models could beat naïve

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Art, evidence that, long run, inflation

 MR. ROLNICK. Well, theory, quantity theory—as well number

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Remember, also theory says

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. certainly agree three factors

 United States also experienced puzzling combination low stable inflation

 Let pick two, though arbitrarily, Britain Canada. First all,
 achieved low, relatively stable inflation low rates unemployment, would suggest
 perhaps common explanation countries experienced that.
 However, two countries see kind productivity pickup we’ve seen
 United States. countries others well shift monetary

 MR. BRAYTON. One comment might weight give

 quantitative effect dramatically larger estimated. that’s less

 surprising reports continue mixed. We’re still hearing significant

 hold managed cautiously. contrast, housing sector holding quite

 Consumer spending slowed somewhat May, contacts suggest

 also seem bounced back June, annual rate reported mid-16 million
