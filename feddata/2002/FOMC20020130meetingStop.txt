 I’d say principal interest recommendations monetary policy stem

 Aim long-run average inflation rate low; respond aggressively movements
 inflation output; pursue policies promise higher inflation following zero-bound
 episodes. Let assume that’s pretty close you’ve concluded.
 first recommendation—aim long-run average inflation rate that’s
 low—we actually already that. occasional efforts distinguished friend Mr.

 I’d rather Congress believe people United States

 That’s kind inflationary target like. So, considering staff analysis

 let ask question characteristics econometric model we’ve

 people anticipating ongoing deflation 10 percent. imagine another case
 sort 5 percent deflation 15 percent 20 percent expectations fully

 course, experience fact had.

 Actually, would put weight incoming data, particularly case

 One way think policy decision—and one raised thus far—is

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, central banker credentials work.
 [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. job worry everything. Good news good bad.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Don? not, let get started.
 don’t much add said, issue think requires
 attention. Earlier today, Dave Stockton raised question potential internal inconsistency
 forecast, stipulates profit margins remain flat low level also
 assumes stock market holds up, wealth effect does, demand
 capital goods starts come back.
 also question whether lower portion chart 9 yesterday’s
 presentation, depicts nonfinancial corporate profit shares last twenty years,
 depicts true underlying profit potential. Current projected profit shares shown
 chart 1991 even 1982. constructing national income
 accounts, BEA includes stock option realizations wage salary component
 accounts largely excludes capital gains companies may offset costs.
 reason that, definition, capital gains stripped national income accounts.
 However, one seriously question whether including realized capital gains
 company-issued stock options employee compensation excluding capital gains
 company profits constitutes “single-entry bookkeeping.” Indeed, capital gains
 exercise options included company income, profit share would boosted
 sufficiently large amount bring back 1991 levels least.
 Nonetheless, decline profits share ratio, even taking appropriate account
 sides firms’ books, still pronounced, raises interesting questions
 
 January 29-30, 2002
 
 Page 118 194
 
 forecasted recovery tepid. reason surely 3.1 percent annual
 productivity growth rate fourth quarter might bottom cycle.
 usual expansion profit margins coming bottom business cycle typically
 boosted turnaround negative positive output per hour. However, unless somebody
 wants come forecast 6 percent annual productivity growth rate, it’s hard make
 projection time around. consequence we’ve got tricky problem would
 venture say that, indeed correct profit margin forecast, clearly implied
 stock market valuation Greenbook right.
 David argued, numbers, especially levels, quite sensitive
 small changes big aggregate totals like employee compensation. Consequently,
 slowdown rate increase compensation little larger expected
 rate price disinflation onerous implied Greenbook, we’re talking
 7 percent profit margin. aggregates involved large, small
 changes elements unit labor costs, even corporate energy costs,

 problem Greenbook indeed may right, slowness
 economic recovery effectively reflects interactive way suggests remains
 open question whether final demand really going pick inventory runoff
 starts abate. leads ever-increasing need, think, standard old-fashioned
 Keynesian multiplier effect coming swing inventories spilling disposable
 income creating level final demand beyond what’s implicit Greenbook.
 may seem like standard recovery post-World War II recession, anomaly
 because, commented before, GDP hasn’t gone much. Indeed,

 momentum multiplier kick, one factors given us

 Indeed, may reality, would say different type recovery.
 consequence, general notion keeping balance risks toward weakness

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank much. item involves another step
 journey toward greater transparency, started several years ago. issues raised
 memo distributed dated January 22. I’d like put Committee three
 questions, interrelated. One is, disclose existence dissents—the tally
 vote target federal funds rate, will—after meeting? second question
 is, so, disclose? question number options. could
 disclose vote itself—that vote unanimous 11 1 against,
 example. Alternatively, could disclose tally vote names dissenters,

 reasons exist favor disclosing tally, possibly names dissenters, around
 
 January 29-30, 2002
 
 Page 130 194
 
 time release press statement meeting. First, information may
 relevant markets fully understanding policy decisions. existence
 dissents comes currently, certainly noted press perhaps, though it’s hard
 say, certain market participants. Second, absence disclosure vote
 immediately following meeting recently led market participants journalists,
 occasion, use proxy try determine whether dissents.
 proxy seem using number Reserve Banks requesting change
 discount rate. proxy sometimes accurate, sometimes not. third reason
 disclosing existence dissents names dissenters currently follow
 practice respect votes taken Board Governors discount rate actions.
 indeed disclose vote tally, past dissents, names
 dissenters. would conforming practice FOMC votes practice
 currently use respect votes taken Board discount rate changes. Also,
 central banks disclose votes, far tell talking them, turns
 disturbing disorienting markets.
 Additionally, believe press office would obliged disclose tally
 names dissenters response direct question press. date
 direct questions, certainly risk someone either well versed
 Freedom Information issues new press scene ask direct question get

 MR. FERGUSON. Yes, does. I’m looking see Virgil Mattingly here.

 MR. FERGUSON. Yes, that’s reason raised point. Virgil told
 currently situation follows: first time someone asks information, press
