 Inflation inflationary expectations dropping. 3½ percent floor level long

 middle panel baseline forecast, which—picking Governor Kohn
 others said—I would describe bad also good. we’ve
 already talked about, we’ll according baseline forecast growth continues
 potential forecast period. result would positive output gap
 lingers throughout forecast period. Resources, particularly labor market, likely
 go underutilized several quarters, inflation, anything, gradually recedes. Even
 accommodative policy would describe fairly bleak baseline outlook may
 call question resolve respect achieving two goals Congress given
 us. One might argue respect baseline there’s really nothing monetary policy
 stage long variable lags understand exist. However,
 core part picture add two others may suggest slightly heightened sense
 awareness part Committee.
 First, think assumptions support baseline may turn
 true appear paper. one looks household sector, staff analysis
 indicates, performance depends number underlying assumptions.
 think true. believe productivity increases tax cuts already passed
 Congress sustain consumption growth. However, assumptions less
 certain about. example, staff seems implicitly assuming house prices
 continue rise. would argue, based recent information respect whether it’s
 level mortgage rates change mortgage rates drives house prices
 refinancings, that’s really clear. Indeed, seems unlikely house prices
 refinancing continue go rapid pace recently. would note
 
 September 24, 2002

 still pipeline. I’d say course forecast we’re likely see
 gradually erode, assuming mortgage rates don’t continue come some.
 Another thing worries bit baseline forecast assumption
 won’t another extended round negative wealth effects equity prices. staff
 assumes that, forecast period, equity prices go up. However,
 intermeeting period we’ve already seen equity prices move somewhere 6
 8 percent. implied volatility stock index futures suggests great deal uncertainty
 future equity prices. one adds fact corporate warnings tended
 move toward disappointing side, think brings question basic
 expectations respect wealth continue influence households
 household spending plans.
 final element worries little baseline think may
 underestimating degree nagging underutilization resources leads
 possibility paltry increases wages salaries, could bit
 negative impact. see obvious downside risks household sector forecast

 see something similar respect business fixed investment. forecast calls
 BFI turn sharply negative 1.9 percent year positive 8.8 percent next year
 10.5 percent 2004. factors expected support turnaround include
 certain, tax incentives depreciating capital stock. again, seems

 suggests increased cash flow increased need capital meet growing demand
 two elements stimulate businesses invest, resulting turn BFI negative

 disappointing top line growth. leaves basically ongoing restructuring
 productivity increases, powerful neither certain enough

 second part triptych, will.
 third part triptych international environment. We’ve already talked

 passivity policymakers Europe Japan respect weakening

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. I’m going summarize remarks since many echo
 comments we’ve heard around table today. believe economic data we’ve
 seeing recently continue show mixed signs strength recovery. would
 also echo concerns expressed others direction forecasts going.
 Since beginning year, staff forecasts fourth quarter year 2003
 continually revised downward. past two months production worker hours
 average weekly hours declined. know manufacturing weakest sector

 inflation forecast also continually revised downward levels give
 concern, based discussion January meeting.
 positive side, however, inventory liquidation appears leveling off,
 forecast sales increasingly coming new production fourth quarter.
 business fixed investment appears nearing end seven-quarter decline, sustained
 growth forecasted beginning next year. Equipment software investment

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Vincent? Obviously,
 convincing usual. think there’s emerging consensus within group ought
 looking economy policy. regard, believe it’s important summarize
 developments list various alternatives confront.
 First, think it’s fairly evident unprecedented levels equity extraction homes
 exerted strong impetus household spending. see incoming aggregate
 data spending, though measures reflect consumer attitudes psychology.
 know, example, level existing home turnover quite brisk
 average extraction equity per sale existing home well $50,000. substantial part
 equity extraction related home sales, running annual rate close
 $200 billion, expended personal consumption home modernization, two components,
 course, GDP.

 point drift normal range, it’s thus far. Similarly,
 historically high level refinancings third quarter, reflected data
 applications reported Mortgage Bankers Association, creating large increase
 cash-outs. estimate they, too, running $200 billion range annual rate,
 significantly year eighteen months ago. Perhaps
 importantly, evidence slowing refinancing activity. average rate new

 differential plays important role models refinancing activity constructed
 Board. models, fit historical data well, suggest refinancing activity
 continue quite strong months immediately ahead. Accordingly, likely see

 view, induced substantial extent much level thirty-year
 mortgage rate fact rate falling fairly pronounced pace.
 models existing home sales actually suggest level mortgage rate
 determines level existing home sales; complex issue, remains seen
 whether fact net change mortgage rate impact sales. Obviously, must
 impact refinancings because, rate new mortgages stays average
 rate outstanding mortgages extended period fosters heavy refinancing activity,
 two rates must converge. converge, propensity refinance must
 invariably fall.
 evidence modest slippage sale motor vehicles quite

 saw fairly pronounced drop last week’s chain store sales, consistent
 reports we’ve heard around table. However, must caution chain
 store sales figures useful indicators overall merchandise sales, especially
 weekly data look at. Motor vehicle sales obviously close exact number
 get economic statistics, estimates talking basically come directly

 appear personal consumption expenditures component GDP. appraising
 consumer spending, big difference motor vehicle sales chain store
 sales. One really accurate; close dubious. Even so, fact
 moving direction suggestive view slowing growth overall

 Another positive element outlook fact inventories getting tight.
 weekly industrial production data suggest modest increase month September

 frankly don’t believe latest book value figures have. reason say

 sense economy position move forward number negatives
 get shortly removed.
 Another obvious positive behavior productivity data. I, least, believe it’s
 unequivocal positive, although employment figures clearly not. It’s really quite
 startling see significant productivity numbers are. GDP accounts, tend
 look product data, data showing fairly strong increases. Nonfarm
 productivity 4.3 percent annual rate second quarter. say you’re using
 4 percent current quarter, David?
 MR. STOCKTON. Actually, reduced 3.8 percent, allowing
 revisions hours data got late last week.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, practical purposes productivity still
 strong measured product data. It’s even stronger calculated data
 based gross domestic income. statistical discrepancy two estimates
 
 September 24, 2002

 increasing growth GDP measured income side moderately stronger
 seeing product side. Obviously, relative strength spills dollar
 dollar alternative productivity estimates. And, course, that’s reason
 nonfinancial corporate productivity based income-side data good deal stronger
 overall nonfarm productivity. last four quarters second quarter, incomebased productivity gain 6.4 percent nonfinancial corporations. quite startling
 increase, indeed would imagine business firms expended great deal effort
 increase productivity various means, including use previously unexploited
 efficiencies. least, fairly solid argument could made early year,
 gets pretty thin far recovery. One would think business firms scraped
 bottom barrel six months ago. substantial multifactor
 productivity growth clearly we’re getting extensive capital deepening.
 Something happening, evident data. hours figures pick
 independently household survey track payroll hours fairly closely, substantial
 part strength see GDP data real product numbers. So, it’s data
 problem. It’s data dilemma, answer data faulty.
 Interestingly enough, significant acceleration profitability. We’ve
 gotten some, margins actually flat last three quarters. reason
 getting price deflation corporate sector. Part acceleration productivity
 showing lower prices rather higher profit margins. Nonetheless, data
 look pretty solid fairly impressive, one wonders corporate
 managers gloomy data accurate. Well, gloomy largely

 economy sinking momentum isn’t really there. answer question

 Alternatively, point presumably patience become exhausted. fact, might

 Now, seem faced general malaise, particularly business sector.
 often try think what’s going asking real surprises imagine—

 two standard deviation events data confronted with—that would change way

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. endorse parts
 recommendation, including implicit part dealing geopolitical risks
 statement. Let take minute talk two three issues.
 One issue people raised concern unbalanced growth.
 regard, Vincent picked point discussed yesterday, that,
 definition, interest-sensitive sectors move sectors response changes
 interest rates. One Committee’s mistakes back 1970s, think,
 concerned tanking housing market and, therefore, FOMC slow lean
 inflation. concerned stimulating housing market slow us
 housing interest-sensitive sector. put philosophical question table:
 choice unbalanced growth gets economy back trend perfectly
 balanced economy that’s growing infinitely trend long period time, know
 loss function looks like. would leave one list concerns.
 I’d also like cover two points made. One date next
 meeting, November 6. would argue that, data clear, clear,
 do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, we’ll anyway.
 MR. FERGUSON. Clearly, didn’t disagree that. point
 interesting see fact first time, least short period Committee—
 though know you’ve looking economy daily basis fifty years —the next
 two data releases clarify situation. [Laughter] do, quite shocked. suspect
 next time get together we’ll little one side little other.

 I’m yet ready lower rates address concerns without evidence. give

 probably less optimistic end range outcomes. earlier comments suggest,
 I’m probably still minority today terms thinking policy options.
 understand certainly respect views others, different view risks
 rewards easing point. Based understanding economy is,
 don’t think we’re dealing need interest rate cut point. don’t think it’s
 going speed adjustments we’re still hoping see made.
 We’d love see investment spending, single businessperson I’ve
 talked suggested slightly lower interest rate going spur investment spending.
 fact, I’m struck telecommunications industry, think poster child
 excesses we’re trying get worked out. CEO large Baby Bell runs phone

 industry contraction number firms involved. think CEO would
 worry additional easing point might prolong time take get
 marginal players business. might even lead additional irrational pricing
 short term, would exacerbate problem getting back profitability
 stability. So, using example, don’t think rate cut likely kind
 effects intend. I’m even sure that, could induce additional car house
 purchases, it’s something really want do. I’m convinced others seem
 creating environment people extract still equity houses good.
 summary, say that, certainly understand support notion

 suggested best way it—I believe still case patience. think
 trust resilience economy fundamental ability work

 materialize. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. concur. patient well. must

 Guynn mentioned downside risks moving interest rates ever lower.

 agree Governor Ferguson issue data clarification. I’d
 surprised smoking gun data next two three weeks that’s
 going tell us unequivocally either maintain current stance move rates
 lower. And, frankly, deep preference moving meeting opposed outside
 meeting. that’s something we’ll talk time comes. think that’s
 say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. support parts recommendation. brief period time
 I’ve here, seems every word changed press statement
 accompanies policy announcement generates ten additional questions. even said
 that, think it’s important acknowledge geopolitical risks today. think that’s
 particularly critical.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, support parts recommendation. I’m yet
 ready lower rates, hope data receive coming period clarify
 issues discussed, although doubt clarify situation greatly. hope
 also decision wait next meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. guess I’m
 anxious President Parry getting concerned lack momentum
 robustness recovery despite geopolitical situation. think need pay close
 attention happening data released next weeks.

 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, thought gave eloquent case easing today,
 really thought that’s recommending right end remarks.
 agree Governor Gramlich time come go ahead ease. also tend

 waiting little while. agree President Broaddus ease need
 least 50 basis points.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, would remain open
 minded whether need react intermeeting period not. would
 caution responding inherently noisy data—we’ve lot experience
 that—and also holding standard previous Greenbook forecasts. say
 because, Bill Poole mentioned, part results year come pretty
 much expected one put realistic confidence interval around forecasts.
 certainly largely consistent expected year whole

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Mr. Chairman, support waiting information. I’m
 little uncertain confused role geopolitical concerns statement. don’t
 want tie saying would act certain geopolitical events occur.
 particular, sluggishness continues issue Iraq unresolved, would preclude
 action?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m merely stipulating view that, corporate
 governance issue geopolitical risks somehow removed, several things would

 MR. BERNANKE. Mr. Chairman, appreciate analysis. I’m wondering
 you’re going get statement! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. wrote disappearing ink!
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. May make comment?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think there’s little confusion
 mean we’re talking importance geopolitical events. It’s mean
 geopolitical event is, say, start bombing Iraq three four weeks now. Maybe
 will, maybe won’t. Rather, point geopolitical environment
 level uncertainty effects real economy. That’s lot easier convey
 couple words statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. somebody could tell going invade
 Iraq tomorrow, uncertainty would disappear. Look, experience Gulf War

 Kuwait Iraq. dissolved first two three months, pretty fierce
