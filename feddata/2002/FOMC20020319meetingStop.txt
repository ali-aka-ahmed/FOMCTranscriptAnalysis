 could make one point, going back question asked currency

 running like 10, 11, 12 percent. deficit would $250 billion $300 billion

 concerned getting involved GNMAs may lead regard

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. First, Al’s comment last speech subject
 reminds story twenty-odd years ago banking industry. question
 one banker would be, “Have seen Sandy Rose’s last article duration?” response
 would be, “I hope so!” [Laughter] story relate GNMAs opposed
 dabbling around even read Sandy Brian’s memo, thoroughly
 convinced bad idea. addition prepayment risk, adequately treated
 memo, also risk shortening duration revaluation rising rate

 exploring use repos foreign-denominated currencies. think that’s sensible thing
 think long-term perspective.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. think we’re going memory here. First, would say
 don’t particular preference foreign RPs versus Ginnie Maes; could go either way.
 Ginnie versus Fannie/Freddie issue, believe distinction one point Fannie
 Freddie explicitly privatized. supposedly taken government
 supposed receive public subsidy. adhering line.

 there. One might argue going pressures, may so. think
 argument could turned around bit say that, explicitly operated Ginnies
 Fannies gave reason, might actually clarify distinction supposedly
 privatized not. last point Al’s idea talking Peter Fisher. I’d happy
 us conversation Peter Fisher. even though Peter wonderful, he’s
 magician. way Treasury could issue us securities put securities

 attractive. paper this, else going say? guess, Al,
 hope last conversation that! [Laughter]
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, don’t buy assets. always reduce
 taxes. doesn’t constrain fiscal policy.
 MR. GRAMLICH. means deficit. That’s deficit option. Whatever
 think deficits, believe ought part overall fiscal strategy. don’t want

 Treasury changing strategy something that’s second-order
 improvement monetary policy. don’t think it’s worth that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. guess ought buy Washington Senators!
 MR. GRAMLICH. Treasury could buy issue us security. [Laughter]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. believe there’s easy answer question raised
 Desk. look data outstandings, obvious. one moves
 away Treasuries, what’s left corporates, agencies, mortgage-based paper various

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, memory serves right, think last time
 talked favored “least worst” choice going Ginnies going
 foreign sovereign debt. lot sympathy Al said regarding downside
 Ginnies. Nevertheless, still would go direction. one thing concerned
 relates type problems often arise going ahead piecemeal something.
 I’d like hold long possible take look options again,

 Twelfth District improving, although areas weakness remain could restrain pace

 job growth turned positive states. turnaround appears broad-based across
 sectors especially solid industries hit hardest aftermath September 11.
 Recent job growth helped keep District’s unemployment rate steady despite strong labor
 force growth. However, remains buyer’s market, numerous job applicants choose

 Despite broad signs recovery throughout District, areas weakness exist.
 Commercial construction prime example. Dramatic declines demand office space

 time see significant resumption new commercial construction.

 New England economy consider views expressed various meetings I’ve attended

 things. First, compared situation last meeting, lot changed.

 Recent annual revisions regional employment data help answer questions

 Turning national picture, nearly every data release since last Federal Open

 revisions last Greenbook one—and I’ve looking Greenbooks

 projection real GDP growth first quarter despite fairly significant downward revision
 contribution slower pace inventory liquidation. course, difference big
 change projection private domestic final purchases, expected grow
 2 percent rate quarter compared earlier projection 2½ percent rate

 strengthening final demand obviously reduces downside risks many us,
 included, worried last fall.
 Moreover, net growth jobs February, even due favorable
 weather conditions, suggests labor market may stabilizing. think that’s
 important because, case, would reduce job security concern among
 consumers. continued solid growth jobs real wages needed support consumer

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. phrase “March madness” normally
 refers basketball but, tell staff’s introductory statements, March madness
 year describes frustration forecasting community deal changing
 incoming data. I’m extremely sympathetic that. one saw mainly
 downside risks last meeting, must say time appear risks
 much balanced.
 First, upside, let pick Bill McDonough left off. also looked

 third area upside risk indicators certainly suggest things turning

 second element downside risk slack labor markets

 third area downside risk—and others said well—is pessimism
 CEOs seems driven strong sense weak profit outlook. One must wonder
 CEOs picking sales forces particular leads much
 pessimistic aggregate data might suggest. point, think
 recalibration reconnection CEOs see GDP numbers
 reporting. indeed, profit outlook CEOs—built anecdotal data
 order books—turns correct, obviously that’s bit downside risk.
 Finally, many forces undergirded economy last year,
 including decreasing mortgage rates, declining energy prices, incentives purchase
 automobiles, unlikely similarly stimulative effect going forward.
 Putting together, sympathetic fact we’re facing great deal
 uncertainty, would say risks stage—in terms issues confront us—are
 relatively balanced position respond appropriately incoming data.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Finally, Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. information we’ve seen since last

 objectives. here’s questions concerns.
 Clearly, cannot, not, refuse disclose vote. already make
 available. we, like central banks vote disclose vote, make
 information available passage time. Why? Well, borrow Tom Melzer’s
 words discussed early 1994, perhaps focus attention
 minority view rather consensus view Committee. We’re consensual Committee,
 use Alan Blinder’s terms. release vote reflects best sense Committee
 unit time. objective least part. encourage media markets
 spend time dissenters take away objective, least view.
 Virgil’s note argues disclosing vote may serve deprive markets
 information useful future policy. think reality that’s always case.
 policy decisions next Open Market Committee meeting directed dissents
 previous meeting. Events occur. Things change—sometimes relatively fast. people’s
 perspectives change well. fact, think there’s least chance releasing vote
 serve harden people’s opinions ways frustrate operations Committee.
 make change, several things could happen. Members could become
 increasingly unwilling dissent, dreading media onslaught. regard, question
 whether feasible constrain members speaking dissents, even short
 period time week. second thing could happen, opposite side,
 members could find spotlight extra bit attention liking. might
 welcome focus minority, could create real schisms Committee.
 course, I’m talking present members! [Laughter]

 sum, believe current disclosure policies serve meet objectives
 Committee make information available time frame meets
 objectives—as central banks disclose much do—I don’t see

 MR. FERGUSON. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. see proposal comes from, understand it. bit

 point. don’t want release minutes sooner, don’t think choice
 release vote meeting.
 MR. FERGUSON. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, think Cathy Tom made good points.
 disclosure issues always difficult, it’s generally helpful try get back basics
 fundamentals think issues. way see actions affecting
 economy, short run long run, basically combined effects
 funds rate, say statement, tilt, information release
 relates expectations yield curve. background, think greater
 transparency better less transparency. includes earlier release information
 cases. I’m much favor came out. recognize Cathy’s point
 slippery slope. see merit. think point slope
 going flatten get TV cameras stage room here. Maybe I’m
 optimistic, that’s way feel it.
 Even go recommendation you’ve made respect immediate
 announcement vote, still think would good idea—in fact probably gives us
 reason—to bring release minutes forward, soon possible. might involve
 additional expense. context funds spend monetary policy
 private sector spends trying figure we’re trying do, it’s probably rather
 minor. would hope would think moving direction.
 MR. FERGUSON. Okay. President Guynn.
