 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, economic activity West continues expand

 corporate scandals worked damp consumer confidence West recent weeks.
 More-uncertain consumers appear reined spending somewhat, especially
 nondiscounted products. Consumers also pulled back investment activity, prompting
 another round layoffs local brokerage firms. Charles Schwab, example, recently

 Broadly, challenge policy situation tentative character

 say two three reasons. First, incoming data weak been,
 signaling so-called double dip, obviously put question—more

 people think forward-looking—also suggest outlook less certain

 Consequently, side mission deals sustainable growth, think

 Taken together, seems balance risks moved described

 President Santomero put table concerns Committee
 signal think risks changed distinctly downside. I’d like recognize
 honestly three concerns one might making shift language
 but, let this, go reject one concerns.
 first concern might surprise market. indeed incoming
 survey data seen, including morning, suggest almost

 second concern think President Santomero raised quite explicitly relates

 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, said earlier, don’t favor easing policy

 people made point—is policy already accommodative. real funds rate

 partly downside risks. We’ve revised forecast. Nearly
 everybody around table said they’ve revised forecast next

 Moreover, think financial markets would welcome shift balance risks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation keep
 federal funds rate is, I’d like associate position Al Broaddus
 spelled balance risks statement. Mr. Chairman, interpret commentary
 saying know based best guess future, federal
 funds rate probably stay near term. think balance risks
 sentence biased toward weakness read markets indication rate cut
 come. That’s prediction market going forecast.
 seems first step press statement could indicate evidence
 suggests economy downshifted lower growth path. think outlook
 growth still positive it’s lower previous forecast. I’d also like point
 ample room long bond rates fall. still unusually large spread
 federal funds rate and, let’s say, ten-year Treasury bond benchmark. seems
 could accomplish want accomplish trying convey present view
 policy target funds rate likely remain current neighborhood
 longer period previously thought. least help reflect—I think
 accurately—what position is. market reads way, help bring
 longer-term rates. concerned balance risks toward weakness
 read market forecast cut funds rate next meeting one that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation regard funds
 rate. time last meeting, risks economy inflation fairly well
 balanced. seemed sense room would take quite
 
 August 13, 2002

 bit induce easing policy bar would lower shifting policy
 tightening mode. time around think face evenly balanced set risks.
 Therefore, preference retaining balanced statement risks, believe
 could communicate current concerns wording press statement without
 changing actual balance risks sentence.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. think
 perspective may differ President Poole’s don’t really want tie hands right
 now. concerned weakness. don’t believe respond going
 market rather implications terms consumer business behavior.
 if, new initiatives Congress passed, don’t quickly get
 aggressive actions individuals who’ve committed frauds, concerned
 problem could linger on. Furthermore, don’t restore confidence
 markets, think longer-term impact business financing consumer
 investing. would prefer shift balance risks weakness don’t
 know people going react unusual times. I’d like signal that,
 given uncertainty, risks see outlook today downside.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. support parts recommendation. think—and relates
 something Governor Ferguson raised—that two roles today. One
 monetary policy role. also de facto role time one bastions
 credibility left country particularly Washington, D.C. would suggest

 much analytical explanatory purpose.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support parts recommendation. think
 would premature lower rates, though sympathy
 affinity position. balance risks, I’ve mulling last week
 changing view every minutes! final analysis think I’ll describe
 position using homely statement: bias toward weakness reflect
 discussion view honest assessment think, end probably
 ought go that.
 Let also say one word housing. I’ll try quick it. agree
 bubble. agree productivity change housing construction. relative
 price housing rising compared income prices we’ll call real reasons.
 still puzzled why, since people wealth holders buy housing
 services, whose homes risen relative value spend goods

 work—is conversion unrealized capital gains realized gains. makes

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sound like true conservative.

 MR. GRAMLICH. Either true idiot! [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. Ned, think different interpretations, sometimes
 called conservative compliment. [Laughter] would say you’re true idiot.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Ben saying earlier read transcripts recent
 meetings lot laughter didn’t hear much laughter today. said comes
 later meeting!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. support recommendation change fed funds
 rate meeting change balance risks statement. slight preference
 leaving balance risks statement is. noted earlier, however, believe
 risks shifted toward economic weakness, can’t argue change tilt.
 worry little giving public markets wrong signal, namely plan
 change rates. know viewed way, often is. That’s reality,
 think. don’t want make much this. shift balance risks mirrors reality,
 I’m quite happy go along recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May say parenthetically don’t deny
 balance risks switch effect. get good numbers orders sales
 GDP profits, submit market way ahead us.
 MR. SANTOMERO. agree.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. support recommendation leaving rate unchanged. I, too,
 slight preference maintaining balance risk statement is. However,
 acknowledge risks shifted. Nevertheless, still think, look projections

 stance monetary fiscal policy, lot stimulus remains
 carry economy forward. like others, wouldn’t fall sword issue
 uncertainties economy. balance, though, I’d wait see little evidence
 changing balance risks statement going change expectations
 future rate moves—although agree good numbers would change expectations
 everyone. I’d make comment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Mr. Chairman, concur parts recommendation.

 show Federal Reserve recognizes prepared respond it. I’d like
 add also agree things take turn worse, prepared
 act aggressively. I’m one worries zero bounds, example. fact, one
 might interpret expected decline future federal funds rate certainty

 downward, choice acknowledge that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, comfortable suggest, would
 want associate position President Broaddus first expressed number

 people agreed with. think we’re still learning use bias press
 statement consider end meeting. looking forward usual
 distribution draft press statement, hoping word wizards found
 language short change bias might convey message. share concern
 expressed people many observers, probably most, read change
 bias—at least get string good data—as suggesting we’re going ease.
 Ironically, think that’s added uncertainty really don’t intend convey today.
 accept arguments side, voting, certainly would dissent today
 change balance risks statement. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation move rates
 time. accommodative stance monetary policy place intended
 part protect us hopefully short-term slowdown we’ve seen last month
 six weeks. insurance built in, think current level funds rate
 hold us good stead going forward. agree strongly point move,
 make move 50 basis points, 25 basis points, catalyst would
 significant weakness economy, sudden shock, risk deflationary
 environment.

 balance, slight preference conveying message language press

 recommended. think markets view least short-term increase
