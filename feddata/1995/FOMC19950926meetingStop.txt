 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Would kinds operational changes
 contemplating, working on, require legislative
 authorizations?
 MR. FISHER. implicit division labor
 Kohn myself, working issues would involve
 legislative changes. questions possible changes
 reserve requirements might involve new legislation, may
 better placed talk those. Desk, looking
 simple issues as: time day operate;
 level information operate different times

 MR. KOHN. Board wanted go system low,

 MS. PHILLIPS. think kinds changes

 substantial acceleration. Many Reserve Banks reported

 higher wages. one also sense pockets

 raising compensation solve labor problems.
 MR. PARRY. So, inflation assumptions, really
 quite reasonably optimistic, presume things moving back

 Maybe it's wrong. Maybe it's duration.

 No, feel insecure, I'm going

 MR. PRELL. Moreover, given amount unemployment,

 It's disproportionately long.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Moskow.
 
 MR. MOSKOW. question different subject
 entirely, fiscal situation. Going 1997, Mike, noticed
 Greenbook forecast showed real GDP growing 2 percent
 1997. reduction government purchases seemed big
 impact GDP going far. really three questions:
 viewed permanent change? assumption making
 steady rate GDP growth type fiscal
 scenario? see offsetting private-sector spending
 compensate reduction federal purchases period?
 MR. PRELL. think ultimately depends monetary
 policy pursue. essence, given assumption little change
 federal funds rate--we little ticking
 end next year--we don't see aggressive effort offset
 ongoing fiscal restraint. specified three-year reduction,
 presumption would Congress going pass something
 goes even beyond that. So, fiscal restraint would ongoing
 force economy, though diminishing. it, biggest
 degree fiscal restraint imposed 1996. restraint
 flows earlier actions--over 1993, example--disappears
 smaller increments assumed new fiscal package
 left. So, assumption, degree fiscal restraint
 really diminishing bit move time. felt that, (1)
 wanted stick steady policy assumption baseline,
 (2) produced analysis outcome resource

 MR. BROADDUS. Could follow last question?
 Mike, would think impact economy particular

 MR. PRELL. obvious questions,
 example area medical care. specified

 it's quite conceivable people reasonable means,
 called pay larger Medicare premium deductible
 something, might continue consume roughly amount
 medical care save less short run. suggested,
 package discussed includes lots changes programs
 fundamental--for example, welfare program.
 potential labor supply responses come grips
 with. legislation enacted next weeks, may
 able put long analysis forecast.
 don't think it's going big deal next couple
 years even phasing on. longer
 haul, could effects saving behavior; could
 effects labor supply behavior maybe many effects. We'll
 look carefully pretty radical changes
 discussed programs. Regarding transfer
 programs states block grants, assumed
 short-run cushioning states localities cases
 cutbacks funding absorb cutbacks
 maintain benefit levels. time would change, too.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. Would somebody like start
 roundtable discussion? President Forrestal.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. reported last

 bullish three scenarios Mike Prell presented

 would like offer thought two fiscal
 deficit situation. First all, 1996 election year,
 talking deficit reductions would put place
 legislation yet passed, although new fiscal year
 upon us. Assuming get passed, take time get
 largely place. So, would surprised turned
 great deal additional fiscal drag year 1996.
 also worth noting last three fiscal years deficit

 Deficit reduction lot positive impacts, aggregate
 whatever deficit reduction take place--and hope program
 enacted--I think every expectation negative

 thrown it. August remarked seemed

 largely going dictate nature monetary policy years

 Last time, called attention feature Greenbook

 fourth quarter 1996, small gap opened
 actual potential GDP, gap growing slowly. So,
 extrapolated beyond 1996 one would see uptrend unemployment
 downtrend inflation. current Greenbook forecast,
 gone one year, gap visible;
 still dramatic. real growth rates years 1995,
 1996, 1997 forecast period read 2.1, 2.2, 2.0 percent-all, Bob Forrestal others noted, growth rate

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. comments? not, let xerox
 comments last meeting because, Governor Blinder pointed
 out, good thing happen somebody likes talk
 business outlook things go way expected
 go. usually way. Let point out, however,
 something stated--namely, economic activity,
 income creation, like still undergoing suppressing

 clear data, poke around there, pretty
 obvious pressure reduce inventory-sales ratios still
 retrenchment stabilization lead times
 exacerbating process. sufficient merely look
 final sales, largely inventory numbers passive.

 evidence probability continued weakness

 several risks side. It's
 downside risks immediate; arise get 1996
 result certain extent fact business
 cycle aging. whatever extent accelerator works
 capital goods markets, one must presume
 slowing effects. would minor quibble,
 get to, Governor Blinder's scenario federal funds rate
 higher long-term equilibrium be--a view
 generally agree one think
 commented past--I would caution
 little careful use various models there.
 repeat said past Committee, models
 give forecasts marginally laughable "add" factors
 judiciously applied. Simulations models tend employ
 fixed level "add" factors become less less usable
 go farther, careful presuming
 simulations accurate capturing going
 economy "unattended" projections models--unattended
 meaning add factors allowed run

 would get simulations must necessity nature.
 However, said that, think correct argue
 probably real funds rate level higher long-term
 equilibrium. think argument Governor Blinder makes-namely, get progressive effect inflation rate
 falls real funds rate rises even though nominal rates holds
 stable, probably accurate description. want make
 certain don't go overboard assume simulations
 make useful regard.
 think basically leads conclusion
 probably unwise move today essentially budget
 debates involved. think would difficult us,
 matter craftily constructed rationale moving,

 would suggest done Committee's concurrence.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, support

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. I, too, support conclusion reasons
 gave it. said earlier, drawn view
 economy well currently prospectively.
 terms prescriptions policy, look old physicians'
 oath "do harm" look "A", "B", "C"
 harm would done anything right now. think would
 harmful right raise rates lower them. Lowering
 may next action, agree timing points
 made. don't think waiting right now, view everything
 happening fiscal side, prejudges whether
 would wait future budget debates really drag out. So,
 comfortable using timing argument right now, although
 agree hands tied future
 monetary policy actions.
 Finally, would quote people ate breakfast
 "Don't

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, hate break trend

 might give us trouble road. Inflation certainly well
 behaved whether price stability guess
 matter definition. certainly don't see deterioration
 inflation rate. Finally, think Fed's credibility
 position move today. Now, preference
 along lines irrespective fiscal situation,
 certainly respect view regarding timing. hand,
 think today may good time move. may

 move 25 basis points today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, think adopted strategy
 earlier year wait see things play out. may
 preferred different strategy, think one adopted
 reasonable. selected strategy, tactics
 consistent it, view propose consistent.
 think going rethink overall strategy, though--if
 November 15th meeting December learn
 economy. So, support proposal now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. support "B" symmetric. think indeed
 take account fiscal side, don't know take
 account point. So, ought wait that. Almost
 surely adjust policy point coming months,
 don't sense pressing need today. So, think basic
 arguments correct support them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, favor "B" symmetric well. view
 policy somewhat restrictive, think quite
 appropriate. First all, think hedge
 possibility fact capped inflation cycle;
 hope have, don't think know that. Secondly perhaps
 importantly, would like see trend rate inflation move
 certainly quickly evidenced
 forecasts seen. Perhaps see evidence longerterm inflation expectations fact moving down, rather
 flat picture looking now, might appropriate

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation
 "B" symmetric. reasons me, however, think
 projections growth economy reasonably accurate,
 said earlier quite optimistic inflation
 outlook Greenbook. think good policy position.
 fiscal outlook, though Greenbook
 projections view fiscal restraint possible, don't know
 whether less assuming won't know

 Bluebook alternative B.
 think pretty solid evidence

 looks though economy going continue grow

 don't think much evidence inflation

 would add one point, Mr. Chairman. Recognizing
 bill even current political support still faces
 uncertain prospects, would want see us tie longer-run
 strategy firmly particular bill. particular, still
 need thinking deal Humphrey-Hawkins
 reporting problem going face whether bill passes
 not. discussed problem couple meetings ago.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Yellen.
 
 MS. YELLEN. Let begin saying great
 deal bill endorse. think focus price
 stability single appropriate long-term goal FOMC
 correct. endorse repeal Humphrey-Hawkins Act. think
 numerical target reporting requirements unrealistic
 counterproductive. like idea asked define
 price stability report Congress intend achieve it.
 like bill's recognition fact attainment price
 stability costless terms transitional losses output
 employment, like fact explicitly directs us
 take losses account transition period. So, think
 bill moves us good direction.
 said positive things, two qualms
 bill. first positively endorse
 stabilization policy objective. tone quite negative
 inference suggests one tool policy
 cannot focus one goal. said previously
 think stabilization economic activity important goal
 right, think remain even price
 stability attained. recognize one could make argument
 actions appropriate stabilize output
 employment going coincide one needs
 stabilize price level, namely, lean wind.
 problem world complex that, two
 objectives always go hand hand. apt
 tradeoffs variability output around trend
 variability inflation around level zero. mean
 reject way natural rate hypothesis. So, think
 policy ought directed pursuit two goals, one;
 previously argued, something along lines Taylor rule
 provides formal way thinking could use policy
 pursue multiple goals without way sacrificing goal longrun price stability. hand, agree point
 multiple goals created uncertainty minds
 public Congress aims monetary policy, agree
 
 -42-
 
 Alan Blinder need systematic way clarifying
 doing.
 second concern bill

 government "use practical means... purpose

 two questions. first whether Employment Act 1946
 implications Federal Reserve. One might say Act
 declaration government policy specific
 meaning us whatsoever. little bit legal research
 suggests case. uncovered 1971 memo
 Board's General Counsel, Mr. Hackley, wrote, "The declaration
 Congressional policy set forth Section 2 Employment Act
 unquestionably applies agencies federal government
 including Board, since Board well Federal Open
 Market Committee part federal government." fact
 expressly recognized three Federal Reserve Board chairmen-Chairman McCabe, Chairman Martin, Chairman Burns. Mr.
 Hackley concluded broad mandate certainly govern
 general policies Board, although specific
 obligation pursue particular goals set Economic
 Report President. So, think implications
 Board, even Employment Act 1946 implications
 Federal Reserve all, would oppose repeal feature
 Employment Act implications federal
 government broadly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Alan, ten years directly
 involved process, significant
 potential institutional development seen come forward.
 Needless say, said past bill
 something would strongly support. think price stability

 like way bill structured terms

 bill gives FOMC pursuit longer-term objective.
 realistically allows us take account short-run factors like

 think take account business cycle getting
 there. got inflationary problem cycle

 advantage cyclical developments. So, go forward,
 bill becomes legislation, need take account cycle-tocycle progress even though difficult explain. So,
 general proposition, would support thrust proposed
 legislation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. bill came hopper vastly better
 many people expected. Nonetheless, find can't
 support is. Let explain briefly
 sense say, "Please read Governor Yellen's remarks
 record second time." got go first, I'll short.
 I, too, would prefer much symmetric treatment, guess
 say, light Ed Boehne saying, explicit
 recognition stabilization role monetary policy.
 nothing whatever wrong phrase says "primary longterm goal" price stability. fact, one hundred percent

 perfectly happy law. might even argue

 applicability "taking account" phrase
 mentioned, Tom Melzer worried it--but
 opposite reason. looks ambiguous way dangling

 opposite direction.
 reporting accountability aspects, agree, vast
 improvement Humphrey-Hawkins. don't
 real problem except would like point one

 jest. choice bill

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, think single

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Everyone dislikes Humphrey-Hawkins--good

 also don't like legislation defining do.
