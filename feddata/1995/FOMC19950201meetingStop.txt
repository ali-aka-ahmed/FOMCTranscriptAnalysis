 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. BLINDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. staff
 circulated, actually recirculated, memo
 subcommittee prepared August; accompanied
 lengthy recent memo Virgil Mattingly certain legal
 aspects. going summarize memos; want say
 words. today proposals
 subcommittee calling essentially ratification,
 exceptions--I going come exceptions--of become
 de facto status quo never actually adopted
 policy Committee. de facto status quo evolved since
 existence taping system revealed fall 1993
 prompt announcements policy actions started
 February 1994. true, however, go de facto
 policy formally adopted policy, formalize enunciate
 things, time clarifying tying loose ends
 sense committing staying policy--not forever
 period time. sense, policy merits
 discussion. one thing think important new
 wrinkle document. matter concurring statements
 minutes, say words due course.
 overall philosophy proposal central
 bank's independence carries corollary accountability.
 Perhaps--I put "perhaps" make sure everybody agrees-the Federal Reserve quite acquitted
 responsibility accountability, least well might.
 particular, public right know
 Federal Reserve it.
 three principal things proposal. first
 announcements. issue must relatively
 noncontroversial since February 1994.
 As. far know, everybody seems relatively happy
 practice announcing decisions promptly. Furthermore,
 hard imagine could avoid long interest rates
 target. seems lead ineluctably conclusion
 continue making prompt announcements policy changes.
 issue statements
 make policy adopted rather saying
 policy is. think two questions: often
 make statements explaining ourselves, detailed
 statements be? briefly "how often:"
 subcommittee
 reached majority opinion recommendation ought make
 statement change policy--in case means changes
 short-term interest rates--and make statement
 change policy. must confess favorably inclined
 making statements, period, majority subcommittee, three
 four us, clearly favored statements interest rate
 changes. committee's recommendation--the subcommittee's,
 excuse me. may occasionally lapse calling subcommittee
 committee.
 slightly interesting question, perhaps, merits
 short discussion cannot literally resolved
 detailed statements ought be. statement
 accompanied May action, included change discount
 rate, would call one substantive sentence.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -4-
 
 counting usual boilerplate--the Federal Reserve Board acted
 recommendations Reserve Banks explanation
 discount rate is. one sentence substance
 said something reasons actions. August
 announcement, three sentences substance. remember
 --I hope correct wrong--the November statement
 none. announced decision; boilerplate.
 pretty sure right. last three announcements
 made without enunciating formal policy announcements.
 subcommittee discussed issue extent. surprisingly,
 could reach consensus many reasons, including fact
 hard define consensus is. think
 useful thing would probably Chairman,
 drafter statements, hear views members--to
 extent want say something extent want
 say anything. don't believe possible enunciate
 clear crisply defined policy issue.
 second issue tapes transcripts.
 think many people believe that, abstract, would better
 taping system exist, unanimous view
 subcommittee taping system ought
 turning off. issue whether "off
 tape" portion FOMC meetings. would afford opportunity
 discuss nonmonetary policy matters tape turned off.
 feeling probably case that. slight
 nuance mentioned report whether want construe
 "the tape almost always occasionally turned off" "the
 tape except monetary policy discussed."
 is, course, third alternative turn tape
 all, fact status quo
 operating right now.
 transcripts, subcommittee recommended ratifying
 status quo, release five years, edited
 less exactly now--no change current policy.
 one new wrinkle bears mentioning dealt detail
 Mattingly/Baer memo front you.
 potential danger premature, let call it, release
 tapes transcripts response subpoena certain
 number members Government Operations Committees House
 Senate. time memo written, number
 seven members House five Senate; may
 different now. issue finite number,
 necessarily majority, members committees.
 conclusion Virgil's memo fact danger.
 conclusion subcommittee change
 decision maintain taping system essentially
 now, much would regret successful subpoena would
 actually get hold tapes prematurely.
 third issue minutes. basically recommend
 continuing minutes essentially now. operational
 content recommended action would continue
 written without attribution particular thoughts particular
 people. would add option concurring statements
 individual members. want stress option; nobody
 going asked put concurring statement make
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 minutes longer seems like nice thing do. So,
 recommendation leave concurring statements option
 members Committee wish avail
 ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting, person-by-person basis. virtues
 seem me, indeed subcommittee, three.
 first increase Federal Reserve accountability relates
 quantum information Federal Reserve's policies
 received public. second advantage
 statements potentially serve halfway house agreement
 dissent. is, may times member
 Committee basically willing go along decision,
 member may entirely happy, example, presumably
 brief statement FOMC issues time--if indeed
 statement--and may wish put sort nuance
 assenting vote. concurring statement makes possible member
 say something without dissenting, member wishes to.
 third advantage, think, operational advantage.
 assenting statements will, believe, make much easier practice
 leave drafting pencil Committee's official statement
 hands Chairman without worry 19 people
 around table deciding whether verbs adjectives suit them.
 proposal let Chairman write statement exactly
 sees fit, person persons want put somewhat different
 light decision would option.
 three things proposal. add one
 document. discussed
 Chairman, though recently. come bit
 surprise; thought last night. issue
 blackout period. symmetric blackout period one week
 one week meeting. made certain amount
 sense old policies. people think makes little
 sense policy announcing interest rate change
 immediately. suggestion asymmetric blackout period,
 including limited blackout period meeting;
 may want go far. Certainly asymmetric blackout period
 sort seems order. Mr. Chairman, think suggested
 one- two-day blackout meeting talked this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No. Actually agnostic whole
 issue really given enough attention. would
 curious hear members say.
 MR. BLINDER. So, would also like put table.
 proposal subcommittee issue. think
 
 put everything table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 want go piece piece see
 
 whether consensus?
 MR. BLINDER. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 useful, think,
 
 individuals raise specific questions relevant
 issues outlined. Then, end discussion,
 see whether significant qualifications dissents
 subcommittee majority.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. BLINDER. want go issue issue around
 table person person?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 think issue issue.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Okay. don't take question
 announcements first. reported proposals inverse order
 much discussion thought Committee would want give them.
 first issue announcements, proposal make
 prompt announcements interest rate change make
 announcement change interest rates zero. Then,
 subquestion, would helpful get guidance feeling
 Committee regarding detailed announcements ought
 be. piece paper says Bob Parry first.
 MR. PARRY. regard announcements, think clear
 ought continue present procedure. would
 little concerned would much detail explanation.
 think pretty well served practice explaining
 reasoning keeping quite short. don't see much advantage
 providing detailed statement. would issue
 whether would get consensus well.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. announcements, certainly agree
 continue announce policy actions immediately.
 respect statements accompany announcements,
 mixed feelings subcommittee's recommendations. Frankly,
 reservations--not announcing actions--but
 making accompanying statements easy people
 misinterpret matter carefully write them. Tom
 Melzer points letter received, rationale
 supporting action going released fairly short period
 time anyway. decide continue make statements,
 think ought think little get prepared.
 know experience discount rate announcements
 statements explanations accompany actions
 material effect market reactions, mainly clarify
 action may signal respect going
 future, whether first several actions last action
 series whatever. record pretty clear.
 done good bit research discount rate announcements
 Bank, research done elsewhere. So, think
 point well documented.
 Consequently, certainly mean disrespect
 Chairman, given market impact, think full Committee
 involved preparing statements. well aware
 problem 12 19 people around table trying
 write statements detail, might able cut
 asking staff, perhaps Bluebook, include
 discussion alternative policy actions perhaps couple
 alternative statements might go along alternative
 involves policy change. format might followed
 alternative statements could give sense
 Committee's stance going action taken, whether
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 symmetrical tilted one direction another.
 think ought give consideration.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 case,
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. First all, favor making statements
 change policy, change.
 Secondly, comfortable leaving Chairman's discretion.
 could imagine, example, change policy Chairman
 decides say much all, imagine changes
 would appropriate. think ultimately
 discretion. time time may want consult
 Committee, would make consultation obligatory.
 one concern statements relates
 possibility may take flexibility away
 Committee future. careful that.
 Otherwise, language becomes subject negotiation
 predisposing may may able future.
 statements carefully drafted view
 take flexibility away. think opportunity
 assenting statements really offsets public
 statement made, expectation set motion
 marketplace. Assenting statements coming six weeks later
 going make difference altering expectations really
 give solace FOMC member feels Committee's
 flexibility compromised statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Tom, may ask quick
 
 question?
 MR. MELZER.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. raising tricky problem. Al
 Broaddus saying research, suspect
 research, indicates content respect future
 actions embodied statements. want leave full
 flexibility Committee future, definition
 announcement cannot content. question essentially gets
 issue whether want statement forwardprojecting content. that, Al's point
 Committee voice drafting clearly matter
 material importance. content leaves full
 discretion Committee, would guess
 suggesting normal statement supposed do, really
 backward-looking; forward-looking unless
 specific policy Committee wants convey.
 forward content statement, matter
 indifference whether write not. think
 decision really comes question Committee wants
 statement, it. want forward-looking
 content want retrospective statement effectively
 captures reasons led particular decision?
 MR. MELZER. would want would latter,
 described--a description rationale taking action.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. successful, correlations
 Al's studies go zero--theoretically.
 MR. BLINDER. doubt could that. would
 hard. things read parsed carefully, whatever
 say explain reference past, even
 don't mean to, interpreted implications
 future. make interest rate move say single
 word, thousand people around world start saying
 means future size move,
 related previous moves, whole variety things.
 think reference future always implicit. extent
 make explicit kind art form.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. usual practice read
 draft statement Committee. purpose statement
 capture essence Committee's reasoning. think
 crucial avoid optional differences phraseology
 have, think impossible 19 people 12 people.
 Unless somebody objects, think current practice seems
 working reasonably well. try write statement
 anticipate going object read you.
 general, forecasting reasonably well.
 happen, however, statement made
 vetted Committee becomes public
 objections, important table get
 addressed. would strongly recommend Committee
 whole try write statement meeting go
 on. like writing communique international meeting
 communique take four-fifths time meeting.
 MR. BLINDER. think said exactly
 subcommittee mind.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 procedure?
 
 Would anybody object
 
 MR. BROADDUS. would helpful chance look
 statement draft form make whatever comment deem
 important. briefly, research discount rate
 announcements--it exactly analogous--some researchers
 tried distinguish alignment announcements, really
 policy content talk moving discount rate
 back alignment funds rate, announcements
 clearly policy signal. latter announcements almost always
 have, way worded--and people studied
 carefully--some impact policy. believe said,
 Governor Blinder, hard avoid kind impact. putting
 draft table, somebody might spot problem
 might escape drafter.
 MR. BLINDER.
 Chairman McDonough.
 
 three people list.
 
 Vice
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. strongly persuaded
 announce policy decisions. mentioned before,
 previous practice would make possible today's sophisticated
 financial markets, continued procedure, give

 big difference.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 
 symmetric directive
 
 issue.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No. Somebody argued--I
 forgotten was; may Kohn--that
 important difference. Suppose purposely delayed interest rate
 change 48 hours pending somebody's speech statistical
 release, said change, 48 hours later
 made change; would look awkward.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 
 right; heard
 
 argument.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say Committee made
 decision something like that, still full flexibility
 make change later.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. point want emphasize
 continue Joe Coyne announce Committee
 meeting announcement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes, think works.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think content
 say announcements policy changes quite good.
 Personally, looking back August 16, wish said
 actions expected sufficient least time
 meet objective sustained noninflationary growth. Since
 supportive decision, understand it.
 think, henceforth, might want even careful making
 statement.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, would like put another point
 table. is, Committee made several policy changes last
 spring involved open market operations discount
 rates. cases, except first change, simply
 announced fact rate changed without full
 explanation time. Explanations came later
 Committee's actions taken conjunction changes
 discount rate. really question Committee.
 Committee wish put discount rate type announcements
 discount rates changed would prefer try maintain
 tiny distinction Governor LaWare used call
 "ringing gong" discount rate less open policy
 change involving federal funds rate?
 MR. BLINDER. subcommittee's proposal former.
 statement interest rate change subcommittee's
 

 
 -10-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 recommendation. full Committee reject
 discount rate change.
 MR. KOHN. would announcement unless
 discount rate changed?
 MR. BLINDER.
 MR. KELLEY.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 No.
 
 Either.
 
 Either.
 Either or.
 
 MR. BLINDER. announcement would accompany interest
 rate change, whichever kind interest rate was.
 MR. KOHN. statement would say "we changed
 interest rate" would give least boilerplate
 explanation changed.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 brief explanation.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. First all, agree immediate
 announcements, like way done it.
 is,
 take action, say announcement. Regarding
 statement, think give reason extremely brief.
 started making announcements make sure advantage
 anyone. procedure takes care lot one
 reasons pleased it. Now, take step further-especially change fed funds rate, start
 explaining--we open even misinterpretation,
 think. Every word taken different way, causes
 confusion settles.
 Except rare instances,
 always instances one think of, minimize
 comments.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Minehan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. also agreement announcement
 policy, would like argue bit flexibility whether
 announce "no change."
 instances
 change change policy. instances
 reverse true. example, decided anything
 meeting, think would suggest something different
 way see things indicated minutes previous
 meetings.
 would think situation
 change fact change policy, something ought said,
 hold feet fire every time meeting
 make change. keep options open,
 something communicated, communicate it.
 CHAIRMAN.GREENSPAN.
 
 think good thought.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. would leave statement wording you,
 Mr. Chairman, don't think way draft
 Committee. would like hear statement
 released, would give flexibility. also feel

 I,

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sorry. would say
 going process involving FOMC vote, going
 either preceded followed discount rate change, statement
 used discount rate announcement
 indicated FOMC, least approximate form, FOMC
 vote. challenge whether statement
 captures substance Committee decided, chance
 change it.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. couple comments: might state
 somewhat differently Vice Chairman rationale
 doing. trying make best
 possible monetary policy decisions depends crucially
 quality deliberative process. time, also
 want open possible. balance quality
 deliberative process degree openness, think, ought
 reexamined time time. right balance one
 period may different another period. agree immediate
 change. think rather strong reasons
 announcing changes getting habit announcing "no
 change" decisions, even though conceive situations
 might best. addition examples gave, Mr. Chairman,
 may reason delay implementation couple
 days therefore would awkward issue no-change
 statement, also complication sometimes
 conference calls meetings. view would want
 get habit stating policy changed meeting
 even though might considered possibility change
 unscheduled meeting intermeeting period. Another
 complication delegation Committee makes
 Chairman. Chairman flexibility change policy
 meetings. may splitting hairs, conceivably Chairman
 could think making change decide it.

 stated policy going announce change change,
 could get complicated. much cleaner way
 it.
 issuance statement, think ought
 statement make change. ought short. me,
 main reason somebody going explain action,
 would rather words basis explanation somebody
 else's interpretation. So, think worth sentence two,
 feel rather strongly Chairman.
 Chairman get advice wants Committee,
 responsibility, think ought make clear.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. agree announcing done
 past year, including indication appropriate meeting
 adjourned announcement. far
 
 -13-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 substance concerned, though, think characterization, Mr.
 Chairman, message future important criterion.
 depends critically regime in.
 era people absolutely doubt ultimate
 objectives Committee--if already totally credible
 commitment future price level stability, announced something
 along lines suggested Dave Lindsey memo regarding future
 objectives--and message matter tactics order
 achieve objectives, one thing. case, would
 willing forthcoming action intended
 achieve objectives. However, regime in,
 perceive it, one uncertainty

 trying achieve versus trying
 achieve it.
 case, would prefer briefest possible
 statement minimize misinterpretation.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. agree appropriate make
 announcements policy changes, changes
 continue indicate meetings ended. respect
 statements, think that, general matter, making short
 possible probably best rule thumb. always leave
 open ability communicate needs communicated,
 think left Chairman's discretion.
 draft statement feels matches gist discussion,
 think would useful read. would hate see
 built requirement think Chairman
 needs discretion terms wording final statement.
 MR. BLINDER. end list. would like
 add views. would like align strongly
 Cathy Minehan's views "no change." would want
 committed making statement every time nothing.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Many times nothing say.
 times history changing interest rate
 news changing interest rate non-news. would
 certainly like see us flexibility make announcement
 explain decided change interest rates,
 seems sensible. personal preference would policy
 calls statement every interest rate change option
 statement no-change, means requirement
 statement no-change. would also like go limb--I
 hesitant go limbs know--against obviously
 tide toward briefer terser. believe, reasons Ed
 Boehne others mentioned, situation
 people speak least Fed's decisions
 Fed, interpreted voluminously. nothing wrong
 that. still interpreted voluminously even say

 fairly short statement. talking writing book.
 issue pen Chairman's hand, seems
 coalesced around policy Chairman
 draft, reads it, listens people say,
 unilateral authority wishes. sounds like
 almost everybody one.
 President Moskow wants
 speak also.
 MR. MOSKOW. generally agree thrust
 said. Let preface saying, newcomer,
 think announcement policy past year working quite
 well. Essentially, ratifying current
 practice. Certainly, continue announcing policy changes
 meeting. announcements brief. think
 Chairman's suggestion continue read Committee
 comments good useful. Maybe nuance
 Minehan/Blinder suggestion, would phrase little
 differently though think complete agreement
 saying. understand current practice, meeting
 Joe Coyne announces meeting
 announcement. announcement; essentially
 announcement. seems Committee make
 announcement time want without changing interest
 rates. always option making statement want to.
 could meeting desired. would
 put context "we going announce no-change."

 think would say announcement make
 change, make announcement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One way resolve issue whether
 make announcement change policy view
 policy question part debate.

 words, situation part response
 expect get stems nothing, major policy
 issue, disclosure question; part discussion.
 rare occasions--I think probably quite rare--it might
 want put aside standard procedure, always
 option anyway, part policy decision
 could say policy changed make statement.
 could say change policy make

 thrust consensus leave announcement

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would announcement unless
 something positive gained result making one,

 instruct Joe accordingly. would guess may happen

 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. couple comments: First, issue
 turning tape certain periods time, concern
 that, even though might desirable
 respects, could incur fairly heavy political cost respect
 Federal Reserve perceived. Apparently, public
 perception Fed forthcoming ought be,
 turning tape parts meetings would perceived
 step direction becoming secretive. So,
 mentioned letter sent Alan Blinder earlier,
 might desirable sense, think going incur
 cost, would inclined shut tape entirely.
 Second, thinking issues, come
 way Ed Boehne described before. really think terms

 make sure effective deliberative process

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. KOHN. transcripts participants

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 good point.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. would say current situation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let respond
 quite legitimate question. impression House Banking
 Committee Chairman Leach holding legislative
 initiatives area grounds going
 ourselves. impression have--I don't know firmly based
 is--is don't set policy, real
 interest committee trying something. Whether
 issue would go full House question, suspicion
 support FOMC openness, sides
 aisle, think realized now. Larry Lindsey
 obviously correct. degree Congressional friendliness much
 evident when, say, Jim Leach chair instead Henry
 Gonzalez. don't think views issue
 openness Fed, disclosure sort thing,
 significantly different. Let ask Winn make sure
 misreading. impression, Don, answer
 that?
 MR. WINN. agree impression, Mr. Chairman.

 something subject legislation. Indeed, bill
 introduced first day session concerning Reserve Bank

 Okay.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 want
 
 don't want say more.
 
 President Moskow.
 
 MR. MOSKOW. concerned making long-term
 decision today going bind future Open Market
 Committees many years come. Since new this,
 begging indulgence ask basic questions. First all,
 mentioned Virgil Mattingly's memo came
 subcommittee written report. subcommittee consider
 legal memo later deliberations still agree go forward
 recommendation?
 
 -22-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. BLINDER. Yes. Subsequent memo
 conference call devoted-almost exclusively memo left
 recommendation intact.
 MR. MOSKOW. divide two questions. One is, would
 want tapes today voting today set
 system taping follow procedure going have? Would
 today? sense reading report
 comments would initiate this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 could stipulate that.
 
 [Laughter]
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Okay. case, second
 question whether explored within Committee
 Congress interested area
 ways could open. agree
 policy openness unless going interfere
 deliberative process. explored options?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let address that. think answer
 definitely yes. explored Hill tried
 get sense everyone was. obviously can't
 detail, sure options tried
 surface support. real option exists us
 turn tapes. option believe
 strong support within Committee year ago, mainly
 grounds thought taping inhibited deliberative
 process, concerned subpoena issue,
 somewhat different question. think conclusion, perhaps
 qualification Tom Hoenig, little evidence
 quality discussions reduced. Indeed,
 fervent discussions occurred period since
 knew tape on. issue, think question pretty
 much become moot. issue, think real one,
 subpoena question. issue could freeze
 discussions point. really wanted get paranoid
 whole thing, basically could say that,
 transcripts, would get subpoenaed testify open
 forum. judgment chance getting subpoenaed
 clearly negligible short run, certainly next two
 years. get environment subpoena issue
 becomes big question, guess
 important problem.
 MR. BLINDER.
 MR. MOSKOW.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Mike, finished?
 Yes.
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. want support Jerry Jordan's point--if
 going leave tape time, think made
 compelling argument leaving time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. lightly edited transcript would
 released five years redacted form. redaction
 capabilities. So, really redaction issue.
 
 -23-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Yes, would preclude that. think
 would still lightly edited transcript principal
 written record, also think might something
 gained keeping draft transcripts somewhere archives
 questions might come integrity
 editing process could answered. think would lose
 anything that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Isn't legal question
 redacting? is, within 30 years don't send
 unredacted transcript National Archives? can't redact
 transcript throw unredacted version away.
 MR. BLINDER. confused. Could clarify? thought
 keep unredacted transcript archival purposes,
 also thought heard say
 destroy transcript done
 redactions.
 MR. KOHN. would destroy draft transcript
 incorporate edits. would complete
 lightly edited transcript-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Including materials would later
 redacted publication.
 MR. KOHN. Yes, release public. unredacted
 transcript would turned National Archives 30
 years.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Okay.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. point information think gets
 heart President Boehne's comment willingness
 redact certain materials. Mr. Chairman, intention turn
 tape discussion Mexico
 later afternoon?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one questions
 going raise Committee discussed grounds
 redacting central bank issues. However, must say inclination
 would forget issue turning tape time
 time discretionary basis leaves open question
 that. may problem worth.
 MR. LINDSEY. quarrel me; think makes point
 making earlier.
 MR. KELLEY. last point made, Mr. Chairman,
 turn tape, way accomplish
 negative way instead affirmative
 way. words, issue here, believe,
 appropriate record, whatever may be, monetary policy
 discussions. would argue would unfortunate
 Committee left position unable talk freely
 whatever might want talk monetary policy.

 Precisely.

 MR. BLINDER. used phrase enunciate policy

 MR. MCTEER. No, question enunciate policy

 mean make public not?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. BLINDER.
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 Oh, yes.
 
 meant.
 Make public announcement.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. answer "yes." would make

 MR. BOEHNE. question
 whether allow tapes go certain subjects.
 question Virgil: could argue reasonably convincingly
 redaction? example, keep tape time,
 could hold back 30 years? would legitimate
 kind argument? Would example Chairman uses

 redaction?
 
 1/31-2/1/95

 MR. MATTINGLY. legitimate. could keep
 public information get another central bank foreign

 MR. BOEHNE.
 rest world?
 
 organize
 
 MR. MATTINGLY. would make discussion public.
 organization rules public. Now, Committee talking

 MR. WINN. would note respect dealings foreign
 central banks Congress, back late 1970s early
 1980s considering legislation dealing
 maintenance transcripts, contemplate exemption dealing
 foreign central banks would allowed us withhold
 information 30 years.
 MR. BOEHNE. Returning example, Mr. Chairman, would
 agree outrageous request tape telephone
 meeting October 1993.
 hindsight, however, probably
 served us well tape useful
 showing conspiracy, evil activity
 going on. think cleared air rather nicely even though
 thought really legitimate request.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think clear air,
 issue known discussion going
 transcribed made public, would inhibited
 discussion--as indeed think discussions later.
 special type discussion committee,
 independently individuals happen members it,
 able hold private. committee's internal
 organization. example content particular meeting-who would say whom, would decide followed whom,
 would responsible indicating such.
 turned out, soon brought Congressional committee
 staff members listen tape, issue gone. one
 uttered new word. fact tape discussion
 available scrutinized found inappropriate.
 accused sorts conspiracies whether tapes,
 whether tapes, whether publish time
 always question: telling them?
 unanswerable question. Maybe overly sensitive
 particular episode, thought real violation
 Committee's rights. example, certain types
 conversations can't going
 organize subject making publicly available.
 can't informal discussions.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 That's exactly right.
 
 -27-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, dealing monetary
 policy, lot easier defend preserving confidentiality
 document. think really lot respect
 independence Fed Congress. anyone trying get
 information say relates monetary policy, going
 successful defending documents nature.
 monetary policy--and kind tape dealing
 with--it hard raise best arguments protecting

 monetary-policy types information. hard defend nonmonetary-policy types information Congressional request
 demand.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Tom, want say something again?
 
 MR. MELZER. substance. going suggest
 might helpful Chairman take straw vote--a show

 Okay.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think, Mr. Chairman, could
 distinguish organizational matters would taped
 monetary central banking matters would taped.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. BLINDER. would suggested something like
 "confidential matters pertaining monetary policy" rubric

 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Could repeat Bill McDonough said?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Bill, don't repeat it.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. suggested organizational
 matters, discussed examples, would taped.
 matters would taped would monetary policy central
 banking matters. know anything else talk about.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let give case point--today's
 meeting. would taped beginning meeting
 discussed Committee's organization. would publish,
 obviously, list everyone got elected; part
 normal record. suspect would taping particular
 discussion.
 MR. MCTEER.
 
 That's right.

 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Yes.

 Shall next item?
 it.
 MR. BLINDER. Yes, since one easy, let's go
 novel aspect subcommittee proposal, allow
 individual members option add concurring statements
 minutes.
 would like say starting
 Mullins subcommittee subcommittee, lot
 remember. inherited proposal Mullins subcommittee
 heartily endorse it, although wasn't idea means.

 wanted mention that. floor open.
 think lot said
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 concurring statements and, Alan, articulated arguments
 well.
 would like throw one reservation.
 possibility concurring statements, going invite
 might like. start one concurring two concurring
 statements, going five six next set
 minutes. happen, quality minutes would
 diminish concurring statements would detract
 essential elements minutes. years, maybe Virgil
 could confirm this, read many Supreme Court Court
 Appeals decisions concurring statements. judgment
 always concurring statements,
 really takes away essence decision court.
 mind raise possibility. think
 invitation people get names
 record. I'm saying delicately can.
 [Laughter]
 Perhaps
 discussion today example that-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Bob, successful!
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. advantages, think need
 take potential drawback account. agree
 going allow concurring statements, would urge members
 Committee judicious use statements.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let ask question relevant
 think Bob Forrestal raising crucial question.
 subcommittee consider sort halfway alternative
 would significant-MR. BLINDER.
 
 Could interrupt one minute?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.

 may view terrorist already.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. subcommittee discuss anything
 similar Bob Forrestal said, namely,
 extraordinary circumstances would appropriate assenting
 statements rather general rule? discuss
 question all?
 MR. BLINDER. believe did. discussed
 restrictions. whole subcommittee here. don't remember
 discussing that.
 MR. BOEHNE. think, Alan, general feeling
 subcommittee concurring statements ought
 available option, general feeling statements
 would used often. Now, real way enforce that.
 count good judgment every individual member
 Committee, count good judgment every member
 Committee whole lot things.
 MR. BLINDER. think ever discussed issue,
 would guess, like Ed Boehne, option would fact
 heavily used.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. make issue basically
 table "assenting statements, used
 great judiciousness" something like that?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. different human nature
 familiar with. think closer Bob Forrestal's view
 privilege rather right.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 President Hoenig--I going list.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Chairman defined proposal now,
 could live it. concept, let say, number one,
 think consensus-building body success
 much built around that.
 also think nuances
 
 -31-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 differences reported defined minutes
 outside world see them. believe would mistake begin
 concurring statements unless extremely limited.
 would define almost never never. Otherwise, invite
 process, Bob Forrestal said, feeling obligation
 state view one's view quite view
 expressed another member member wants get name
 record. importantly, differences,
 think concurring statements invite proliferation statements.
 opens even issue releasing minutes
 sooner. could take us rocky road.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must say considerable sympathy
 analysis view problem here.
 mind ask Winn question? Don, know
 little discussion issue Hill. heard
 any? sense committees might this?
 MR. WINN. really sense
 point great significance Hill people. don't think need
 base determination terms input gotten
 that. cannot report anything significant either side
 aisle.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. originally brought notion
 forward, recall, looking ways open.
 wondering whether fact overreached.
 MR. WINN. think recall correctly, Mr. Chairman,
 came alternative proposals
 getting Hill. Hill proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say piece,
 favor proposal, second thoughts
 recently. willing go along whatever majority wants,
 must say enthusiasm fading. type
 argument Tom Hoenig others made really difficult
 get around.
 MR. BOEHNE. think came originally
 thinking ways expand minutes. subsequent that,
 believe, discovered meetings recorded
 decided release transcripts. Also, made decision
 release actions promptly public.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 mean may moot point?
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Yes, may moot point.
 life preceded making decisions. think arguments
 made good, particularly light

 MR. BLINDER. would like disassociate myself. felt

 said that, won't belabor it. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. I'm opposed concurring statements
 seems way used express reservations

 inappropriate people do. feel strongly enough

 concurring statements wrong.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think unfortunate bit
 history people dissent make statement explaining
 dissent. fine dissent one thinks ought to,
 think dissenting vote enough. So, easy
 understand think consenting opinions truly terrible
 idea. believe function Committee make decisions
 monetary policy. best done Committee reaches
 decisions open frank debate. notion that, well,

 different stated minutes opens us
 factionalism. think Bob Forrestal right. First would
 one statement, would two, would
 heaven knows many. press Street would field

 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. appreciate
 opportunity make comments inflation targeting.
 Actually, going use term "inflation objectives," may,
 think describes reflects accurately
 mind. mind, idea whose time definitely
 come. Let cover three things. try
 briefly compactly still get main points across.
 First, summarize clearly analytical case
 kind explicit inflation objective. Then, want comment
 one frequently heard objections. Finally, would
 like say little specific kinds objectives might
 want introduce might proceed Committee decides,
 hope will, good idea wants move
 direction. this, build Dave Lindsey's memorandum
 think nice job laying main issues
 considerations balanced way.
 briefly, basic argument, see it,
 implementing operationally meaningful explicit inflation objective
 would allow us time foster better economic
 performance. would occur, brief, would moving
 away almost purely discretionary approach policy
 followed historically, focus reacting emerging shortterm economic developments, toward approach central focus
 would precommitment permanent low inflation objective
 would clear feasible. course, face it,
 assertion made changing approach policy way
 going improve economic performance that;
 assertion. think fair say supported
 much, most, important research done monetary
 economics course last twenty years. Dave Lindsey
 alludes refers issues public
 market form expectations future inflation
 expectations way formed relate monetary policy
 effect upon economy--the so-called time-inconsistency problem
 that. Beyond theoretical considerations, however,
 experience years current approach policy,
 accelerations decelerations re-accelerations
 inflation, suggests periodic inflation scares financial
 markets damage inflation done economy naturally
 make lot people think got better way.
 broad background, let quickly list
 important advantages see credible inflation
 objective. Many also noted Dave memorandum.
 First, signalling disinflation advance, credible inflation
 objective likely would reduce real cost transitioning
 permanently lower inflation rate. Moreover, related this,
 credible objective would allow Committee pursue activist
 policy freely short run without worrying losing
 credibility. situation face today good example this.
 Since probably yet seen full effect economy
 tightening actions last year, already beginning see
 least signs moderation aggregate demand, one could make
 case caution approaching tightening policy
 today. However, current approach policy, obviously
 big risk. exercise caution, could
 misunderstood, reduce credibility, conceivably produce
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -40-
 
 inflation scare financial markets, destabilize economy.
 one point.
 Next, explicit inflation objective would efficient
 way break current Humphrey-Hawkins reporting conundrum.
 problems targeting monetary aggregates well known
 everybody including Congressmen. Consequently, HumphreyHawkins process, would argue continue focus sizable
 amount attention aggregates, look little
 silly. hand, don't provide substitute,
 risk agenda set us focus whatever shortterm problems seem pressing time distinct
 coherent, consistent longer-term strategy befits central bank
 standing stature.
 Finally, worth noting number industrial
 countries, sure aware, established
 explicit longer-term inflation objectives one form another.
 put place course last
 three four years. think motive cases try
 lock currently low inflation rates. Obviously,
 limited experience new procedures,
 reasonably successful time, think likely be,
 sure want one industrial countries
 moving direction. true, Dave mentioned
 memorandum, Bundesbank explicit inflation
 objectives, strong legal mandate price
 stability, course, broad public support rooted
 long bitter historical experience. main positive
 arguments explicit inflation objective see them.
 quickly main objection approach:
 Dave points out, main objection short-term trade-off
 said exist real activity inflation. Critics
 inflation objectives consequently argue maximize
 contribution public welfare economic welfare exploiting
 trade-off. Hence, argue anything prevents us
 that, like tying hands explicit inflation target
 sort, would undesirable. Dave indicates, argument
 would seem compelling case supply shocks, like
 oil shocks back 1970s. see it, argument
 really whole lot punch except limiting case
 rigid, inflexible numerical inflation objective.
 general, see least, nothing incompatible
 credible long-term inflation objective one hand
 flexibility cushion economy supply shocks long
 public understands confident longer-term
 commitment remains place dealing short-term
 problem. Indeed, far reducing flexibility, seems
 credible long-term objective arguably would increase
 flexibility dealing shocks would
 worried losing credibility situation.
 Let move final issue want address: is,
 exactly go establishing credible commitment-exactly kind objective set tell
 Congress? want recommend need something
 concrete back up. important point inflation
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -41-
 
 objective used way used old money
 supply targets, is, mechanism guiding short-term,
 tactical monetary policy actions. apologize repetition:
 purpose inflation objective commit credibly
 maintaining purchasing power currency, like
 Bundesbank's legal mandate Germany. confess
 think lot, staff get room
 pursuade this. things mind, would argue
 adopt numerical target even form range
 think would set us failure. Instead, would
 recommend Committee commit firmly publicly
 objectives contained Neal amendment respect
 language amendment way defines price stability
 also importantly respect 5-year time horizon.
 communicating this, Chairman could state upcoming HumphreyHawkins testimony Committee considering taking step,
 perhaps summer, given increasingly obvious problems
 focusing money supply targets Humphrey-Hawkins process.
 Chairman could also urge Congress pass Neal amendment.
 recognize amendment gotten significant support
 date, election clearly changed makeup Congress
 good bit, technical problems using money supply
 nominal anchor increasingly apparent all. think
 explain backdrop.
 Finally, see it, strong advantages
 proceeding way suggested. one thing,
 already record favor Neal amendment. would
 radical departure position Committee taken
 earlier. Also--this important--doing suggested
 would prevent Fed taking kinds policy actions
 take today stabilize employment output. would do,
 probably important thing saying today,
 discipline us justify short-term actions designed stabilize
 output employment commitment protect purchasing
 power currency.
 respect, also important part
 would propose, would recommend begin publishing sort
 inflation report, perhaps semi-annually, conjunction
 Humphrey-Hawkins process along lines report
 currently put Bank England. would help guide us
 making short-term policy decisions, would also publicly
 underscore longer-term commitment. view agree
 this, report prepared Committee's staff,
 drawing System resources staff wants draw on.
 this, seems reasonable presume progress toward
 achieving inflation objective would naturally supplant money
 supply targets, especially short-run money supply targets,
 principal focus Bluebook staff presentations.
 example, short-term policy alternatives always
 Bluebook could discussed least part perspective
 consistency long-term inflation objectives, rate
 progress toward objective, risk particular
 alternative would present regard missing objective
 related matters.

 Let end saying realize explicit
 inflation objective magic wand: going solve
 problems; going solve world's problems;
 going grow hair head. think kind
 objective suggested practical one believe
 feasible one. time, convinced could help improve
 increase contribution nation's economic welfare.
 rest case.
 GOVERNOR YELLEN. strongly opposed adoption
 formal multi-year inflation targets. thought would begin
 outlining case them. proposal two distinct
 features. first number goals
 pursuing, single goal multiple goals. taking proposal
 essentially strong one Dave Lindsey suggested
 memo, namely, inflation rate sole objective
 policy current future years weight placed
 achieving competing, ultimate goals real variables. going
 speak proposal, note somewhat stronger
 proposal heard Al support. second aspect
 proposal numerical opposed qualitative targets.
 Since particulary opposed single goal,
 remarks going focus rather numerical
 character it.
 began asking question,
 public cares about? answer seems straightforward me.
 high variable inflation; aspect
 economic performance people care about. public also cares
 real outcomes. Households businesses much dislike
 fluctuations output employment, good reasons. Quite
 naturally, prefer higher average output lower average
 unemployment. consider goals eminently sensible, foolish
 irrational.
 ask myself, Fed accomplish?
 conclude actions Committee affect level
 variability inflation also minimum variablity
 output employment. know people would argue
 trying reduce variability output grounds
 economic forecasting uncertain long

 understand mandate Federal Reserve Act pursue
 multiple goals pretty vague. really guidance
 Act call tough trade-offs. see objectives
 fundamentally sound, think Fed, pursuing goals,

 Fortunately, goals price stability output
 stability often harmony, goals conflict
 comes calling tough trade-offs, me, wise humane policy
 occasionally let inflation rise even inflation running
 target. Supply shocks, course, like '70s
 obvious case. avoided uptick inflation would
 required dramatic tightening monetary policy
 would downturn even major proportions.
 benefit hindsight, seems maybe Fed
 accepted unemployment less inflation.
 valuable lesson us. extreme proposal--that
 need counter shocks pure inflation target--is
 draconian. recently 1990-91, Committee sensibly
 loosening monetary policy price stability achieved and,
 mind, producing better economic results consequence.
 want belabor point; could discuss
 great detail. However, want least mention
 Committee decide really wanted quantitative monetary
 policy rule incorporating numerical inflation target--for example,
 thought important nominal anchor
 monetary policy--we go type rule embodied
 Neal amendment, pure inflation targeting scheme. Why?
 clearly better rules. could talk
 length simple approach, necessarily best, dominates
 inflation targeting would hybrid rule would adjust monetary
 policy--and could mechanical rule desired--on
 basis two gaps, one. would gap actual
 target inflation also gap actual potential
 output.
 next question is, central banks really do?
 look behavior FOMC central banks, simply
 can't find lot cases monetary policy ever
 driven exclusive focus inflation performance. Consider,
 example, policy Bundesbank--whose price stability
 commitment, seems me, seriously question.
 behave? deliberately tightened monetary policy 1991,
 much? enough keep inflation rising even though
 knew inflation would rise. deliberately chose tighten
 less called keep occurring. Now,
 take case FOMC, seems reaction function
 real funds rate changes roughly equal amounts
 response deviations inflation target 2 percent
 deviations actual potential output describes tolerably well
 Committee done since 1986. policy, fits
 behavior Committee, example type hybrid rule
 would preferable view, wanted rule. think
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -44-
 
 Greenspan Fed done well following rule, think
 sensible central banks do.
 Let turn issue credibility. key argument
 favor inflation targeting--Al made point--is would
 raise FOMC's credibility result lower sacrifice ratio.
 Clearly, could achieve this, would worthwhile
 benefit. problem view achievable. First,
 look experience countries adopted
 carried inflation targeting programs, consider results
 discouraging. Then, think Bundesbank ask
 is, credibility really lowers sacrifice ratio,
 Bundesbank bore high costs, rather Germany bore high
 costs, first 1980-83 1992 present
 efforts reduce inflation. Then, look empirical estimates
 suggest German sacrifice ratio actually exceeds ours, whereas
 think little doubt credibility probably exceeds
 ours.
 
 second point concerning credibility
 think inflation targets would raise credibility simple reason
 would credible. would prepared believe
 FOMC single-mindedly going pursue inflation target
 regardless real economic performance, even Bundesbank
 prepared go far? So, means targets going
 perceived hoax. going believable
 would told child going cut
 hand put candy drawer. me, inflation targeting
 strategy could easily undermine Fed's credibility reputation
 policy credible.
 Let conclude. could talk little dynamic
 inconsistency, sake time think pass
 unless someone wants come back it. Let make final
 point. final concern connection FOMC support inflation
 targeting legislation like Neal amendment, new version
 that, relates go Congress testify
 it. concern likely end understating
 cost. guess argue price stability
 goal overriding importance, important
 beneficial pursued costs. truth, think
 excellent evidence one-time cost lowering
 inflation high. percentage point reduction inflation costs
 order 4.4 percent gross domestic product,
 $300 billion, entails 2.2 percentage-point-years
 unemployment excess natural rate.
 testify, seems point
 benefits price stability elusive costs
 additional output instability plan could easily outweigh
 benefits greater inflation stability. Why?
 uncertainty sales impedes business planning could harm
 capital formation much uncertainty inflation
 create uncertainty relative prices harm business planning.
 noticed Neal resolution contained preamble, read
 part, "whereas zero inflation promotes highest possible
 sustainable level employment, maximum sustainable rate
 economic growth, highest possible rate savings
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -45-
 
 found interesting contrast
 investment..."
 conclusion Federal Reserve System's price stability
 economic performance project 1989 read, "We investigated
 direct indirect evidence surrounding hypothesis
 inflation adversely affects performance real economy.
 bottom line efforts probably surprising.
 remains exceptionally difficult uncover clear-cut evidence
 moderate rates inflation reduce perceptibly growth level
 measured GDP."
 final point that, political standpoint,
 support inflation targeting amendment, without
 appropriately emphasizing costs order obtain mandate
 achieve price stability costs, believe
 consequences us. end blamed realities
 falsify belief close free lunch. point,
 would like conclude quoting remark made former FOMC Vice
 Chairman Corrigan, gleaned transcripts
 December 1989 FOMC meeting discussed. said FOMC
 "excruciatingly careful claim." said, "I
 worry bit collective zeal, we've got careful
 oversell done cost.
 leave impression cost turns lowball

 whatsoever."
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 would never known
 
 speaking!
 MR. JORDAN. think Al laid well arguments
 setting inflation objectives would desirable helpful
 Committee accomplishing mandate. took Janet
 Yellen's response combination implementation problems
 versus desirability issues, think need discuss
 separately. Al's magic wand, would want do?
 would want wave businesses households
 country make decisions expectation
 increases inflation--and associated nominal interest rates--are
 temporary reversed. would argue want return
 period like one 1950s early 1960s
 people looked shocks happened along way transitory.
 confident central bank would
 conduct affairs way inflation rates would move
 direction zero associated nominal interest rates low
 levels. believe Bundesbank position today.
 Janet right says public care
 high variable inflation; care
 standards living. raising different type issue-whether mindset part American public would
 fact achieve kind rising standards want.
 want rich possible time. believe
 stabilizing purchasing power money achieves condition
 making people richest possible time,
 want do. address question appropriateness
 monetary policy meeting today tomorrow, cannot
 thinking going happen CPI
 measure purchasing power money 1995. know
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -46-
 
 long variable lags. also cannot based anybody's
 forecast unfolding events occur regard output
 employment. regard going happen
 future rate inflation, soonest second year
 much likely third fourth years. Ultimately, come
 conclusion monetary policy appropriate asking
 going happen inflation 1996 1997.
 going back down, people confidence
 going produce make decisions based that,
 think monetary policy appropriate. not, say
 monetary policy appropriate. would think American
 public would want confidence assessing monetary policy
 objectives, distinct monetary policy actions, asking
 whether going produce lower inflation rate sometime
 future. inflation objective does.
 PRESIDENT MINEHAN. think two issues
 tend get mixed up. One whether
 explicit objectives reasonably long period time.
 second whether focus solely price stability
 inflation measures target monetary policy. Looking
 latter issue first, would much agreement Governor
 Yellen monetary policy focus one target.
 need recognize short-term trade-offs inflation

 either leave well enough alone adopt series
 multi-faceted targets might better communications vehicles
 Congress monetary aggregates. Janet described using two
 ranges two kinds gaps. also could use nominal GDP,
 wanted, target range something like that.
 come this. Frankly, don't know really decide
 issue. big issue. received good paper, would
 favor trying refine thinking, however come out,
 get something explicit table take vote this.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -47-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let say think purpose
 discussion is. go inflation targeting without
 Congressional statute probably unwise. Neal bill,
 clearly going Connie Mack bill
 close Neal bill, going asked comment it.
 basic purpose discussion get first cut
 Committee stands purposes testifying
 legislation. judgment announce
 specific inflation targets, policy actually similar
 Al Broaddus suggesting. announce explicit inflation
 targets, become effect statutory obligation
 Committee adhere to; sure reading
 Humphrey-Hawkins statute inflation targeting consistent
 it. said, real legislative issue coming
 going significant effect, depending
 testify. think real issue. important
 us going testify bill know
 Committee members since speaking them. President
 Melzer.
 PRESIDENT MELZER. Alan, general, would associate
 Presidents Broaddus Jordan say.
 two questions, la Cathy. first whether agree
 primary focus monetary policy achieving price
 stability. Secondly, agree likely achieve
 price stability credible set specific targets
 inflation?
 respect first question, take simpleminded approach. view monetary policy affects prices
 long run. hard time justifying setting objectives
 respect things can't influence long run. So,
 would much like set objectives consistent
 influence long run. might add--this something
 Al already alluded--that don't think expertise
 fine-tune economy real side timeframe
 vagaries forecasting uncertain effects
 policy actions take. Frankly, even though record
 FOMC pretty good last ten fifteen years,
 view one could conclude perhaps actions stabilize
 actually destabilizing time time. made
 progress bringing inflation down, still long distance
 away would consider price stability even though
 give lip service concept. point Al touched on,
 think important, regime right
 now, trying serve two masters, incurring transition costs
 time directions. perceptions change concerning
 mind acceptable rate inflation,
 necessary adjustments real side. One talk
 transition costs zero inflation, least incurred
 zero inflation, it.
 mode right economy incurring transition costs
 time directions, find satisfactory.
 respect second question--whether agree
 likely achieve credible price stability set specific
 targets inflation--I think Al's answer right.
 want get bogged technical details. thought
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -48-
 
 issue targets, would inclined set them. think
 set quantitative targets--and could
 respect trend rate inflation would making point
 estimate given year relatively short period time
 would looking moving average time--we could set targets
 would able achieve reasonable timeframe.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Excuse me, talking
 inflation distinct price level?
 MR. MELZER. think another issue. pros
 cons them. don't think productive get
 today, could continue discussion later,
 clearly one issues ought staff look
 discuss further. respect point, clearly
 announcing set targets would much
 credibility. really determines credibility long run
 perform. guess saying making accountable
 something quantifiable much likely get us
 price stability regime in. talking
 price stability years, still long distance away
 far concerned even though think record FOMC
 quite good.
 third point would make relates something said
 minute ago, Mr. Chairman. is, legislative
 proposals hearings held. think incumbent
 us get position state meaningful
 view Committee try influence outcome. quite
 possible that, regardless think inflation targeting,
 get legislation. confused want,
 could well get legislation like. thing
 would say clear me,
 time discuss it, present legislation
 operate would absolutely preclude sort inflation targeting
 regime. think would advantage go along course
 Al described soon reach sort

 MR.BOEHNE. come somewhere President Broaddus
 Governor Yellen. time, primary goal central bank
 ought price stability, get straight
 line. Whether like not, real world deal
 short-term issues like liquidity problems, weakness demand,
 recession, sort thing. important thing
 deal short-run issues, try best
 context pursuing longer-term objectives.
 second point that--while appreciate theoretical
 arguments make commitment, sacrifice ratio less-in real world matters people say,
 do. got track late '60s '70s said
 did. got back track '80s early
 '90s. this, think, much worrying whether
 inflation went tenth two business cycle;
 secular context. cycle cycle inflation rose '60s
 '70s, cycle cycle inflation went '80s
 '90s.
 think enough political support
 pursuit single inflation goal without regard short-run
 considerations. got 50 people Congress vote that,
 would surprised. real world, deal shortrun issues.
 view ought continue largely
 last fifteen years. think best expressed
 view, Mr. Chairman, one recent testimonies,
 don't remember quote exactly. went something like this:

 ought aim extend hopefully improve upon low inflation
 record. think context knowing
 short-run issues, can't ignore them. going
 deal them. worked inflation double
 digit rates, think get closer price stability time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think recommendations
 outlined Al would useful. would useful, think,
 us communicate public goal idea predictable
 average level inflation. also believe could deal shortrun cyclical issues even within context Al suggested.
 would also say one looks Greenbook
 Bluebook, clear rather difficult period ahead
 us, suggests would nice
 consensus issues within Committee, regardless
 whether go public. Quite frankly, sure
 would approach issues covered Greenbook
 Bluebook longer term without operating consensus.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, issues go, think
 arguments merit. believe couple things: one, us
 change emphasis, needs kind legislation,
 partly about. Among alternative approaches
 discussed, inclined toward something like Neal
 amendment think price stability necessary
 condition long-term growth. time, would
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -50-
 
 strongly inclined toward numerical target, think
 measurement problem that. So, prefer language
 Neal amendment regarding objective price stability. think
 would negate need maintain balance,
 would give us emphasis toward price stability necessary
 long-term growth. also would give us important discretion
 handle shocks allow events take place monetary
 policy address within clear mandate toward price stability
 long term turn give us better opportunity longterm growth. would approach it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. instinct similar many others
 feel would step right direction us adopt
 sort inflation objective. others already observed,
 inflation something profession Committee believe
 held responsible long run. related
 monetary policy, controlling may important
 contribution make economic performance long run.
 said that, would careful overselling
 point number grounds. One already
 referred that, without Congressional support, don't know
 unilaterally would buy us much credibility.
 Secondly, come side ultimately would need
 sort numerical objectives. Otherwise, clear
 proposal differs much already doing. Many
 us already spoken years favor kind
 price stability objective, recognizing short run may
 pursue objectives. Thirdly, don't think objective
 adopt pursue independently fiscal policy.
 really believe fiscal policy sense exploding,
 simply would try pursue price stability? real reservations
 that. Another issue is, need penalty? fail
 gain credibility, fail achieve objective,
 sort penalty, New Zealand? suggesting
 particular penalty! [Laughter]
 Without that, gain?
 would say real sleeper issue--I touched earlier
 Janet raised implicitly--is push comes shove, I'm
 sure good evidence going direction
 really makes lot sense point view economic welfare
 opposed to, example, stabilizing inflation current rate,
 feasible alternative. talk hope
 do, analysis see subject lead
 confident. think hold
 highest standard issue question put us
 Congressional testimony concerning benefits expect

 2-1/2 percent whatever next x years,

 question.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, seems two
 potential ways go here: one primarily quantitative
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -51-
 
 guess hybrids. would
 primarily qualitative.
 leery predominantly entirely quantitative approach
 think might well imply performance would
 able deliver might even want deliver
 circumstances. Either developments would intensely
 case qualitative-type goals,
 counterproductive time.
 hard see Fed going much good
 cause much good unilaterally stating goal.
 see helpful credibility. one thing,
 every one us repeatedly put forward publicly commitment
 price level stability. question anybody's

 mind every person table stands issue.
 announce quantitative goals subsequently
 shortfall, would extremely counterproductive even
 shortfall good reason.
 would impair credibility
 tremendously.
 Now, going testify specific
 proposal Congress--it used Neal proposal
 perhaps Mack proposal--I think going
 look quite specifically. soft,
 somewhere useless worse. rigid, would
 probably mistake also allowance
 time shocks, external events different sorts. Gary
 mentioned relationship fiscal policy monetary policy.
 agree terribly difficult fine-tune, perhaps
 impossible. think would look specific proposal
 see adequate flexibility it, appropriate timeframes,
 appropriate social welfare goals, forth delve
 details. going see proposed rather
 try make broad general statement today sometime
 future.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think Yellen-Broaddus
 debate useful setting merits sides
 issue. think inflation targeting lot appeal.
 main way
 appeals would help us focus policy
 long term give us longer-term focus believe
 now. focus far shortsighted,
 inflation targeting would help us respect. hand,
 don't think mandate inflation targeting. Now,
 clear read materials whether talking
 inflation target would set unilaterally
 Committee legislation. would very, serious
 questions ability legally set inflation target given
 Humphrey-Hawkins mandate. hand, talking
 proposed legislation whether support it, still would
 raise question whether social mandate
 country. inflation target credible accompanied
 widespread agreement indeed mandate.
 Gary Stern hit another aspect this--the question
 mild inflation. think everyone country agrees
 inflation 10, 12, 14 percent, something would need done
 it.
 3 percent inflation harmful economy
 needs reduced? announcing adopting inflation target
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -52-
 
 anything credibility. experience
 aggregates working. time,
 lowering aggregates, don't think necessarily bought
 us lot credibility. Bundesbank mentioned couple
 times. seems situation Germany quite
 different clear mandate part
 German people low inflation. Janet Yellen mentioned,
 inflation target backfire use judiciously.
 bottom line believe goal
 central bank price stability low inflation. believe
 primary objective central bank
 goals well. Governor Kelley indicated, much depends
 structure legislation might come through; would
 escape clauses rest. talking
 explicit target, would very, leery that. asked
 today decide issue, would say would
 inflation target would associate entirely views
 Governor Yellen, think issue needs
 explored further. need give additional thought this,
 particularly light legislative language might develop.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. usual, let defend status quo.
 dual objective Federal Reserve Act now. think
 works well. think case broken needs fixing
 extremely thin. may remember defended
 Federal Reserve Act Jackson Hole, thereby provoking great deal
 controversy. changed views one iota. Many
 reasons enunciated Janet Yellen. fact
 matter is: short-run trade-off, matter
 people. existing evidence--and can't say
 strongly--that targets leads superior trade-off.
 None all. one cases evidence
 equivocal. nothing cited. know
 employment costs inflation reduction substantial.
 even reasonable consensus measure them.
 benefits moving, Gary Stern said, 3 2-1/2 percent
 lower inflation hard measure. would hard pressed
 come anything convincing led large number. case

 needs discipline. view, way, comes academia

 world long time. view
 control central bankers know
 doing, can't trust true mandate fight
 inflation! see behavior Federal Reserve time

 Next--this important me, something
 ever thought Committee--is issue
 honesty. Many central banks claim price stability

 Federal Reserve position. Bundesbank

 yet lowering interest rates. fight inflation
 lowering interest rates--not last time checked! Like Janet
 Yellen, think fundamentally dishonest way

 choice would like have. proposal going anything
 like think going be, would certainly urge
 Federal Reserve oppose testimony.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. think proved anti-economist
 adage that, lay economists world end end,
 reach conclusion. least try touch ends.
 last meeting looking bridge sides
 river; continue analogy. thank raising Mack
 measure think focuses discussion.
 first point would make comes
 choice Humphrey-Hawkins Senator Mack proposal, think
 right way Mack proposal see way change
 Humphrey-Hawkins. Governor Blinder probably incorrectly characterized
 Humphrey-Hawkins giving us dual objective; not. gives
 us seventeen, eighteen--heaven knows many; paragraph
 objectives. good directive Federal Reserve.
 think say us would select Humphrey-Hawkins
 drafting kind legislation. gain
 opening door use vehicle change.
 Second, view well taken Janet Yellen's point
 oversell underestimate costs
 Mack proposal. need honest, think
 disagreement table. Mack legislation would
 costly. Third, think look loss function,
 side loss function gain function, find
 politicians well aware gain function. reason
 fourteen-year terms recognition politicans well aware
 gain function want exploit it. exploited

 Fourth, one things taught economics

 inflation. think nominal GDP, believe
 somewhat line with-what Governor Yellen said. pick
 nominal GDP objective function, begs second question
 answered. nominal GDP target probably
 consistent desired level inflation. So,
 process Congress tell us desired level inflation,
 think probably good. target desired
 level inflation; target nominal GDP. disagree?
 Well, wildly!
 [Laughter]
 final part whatever Congressional testimony
 subject real focus Congressional action
 tell us inflation rate be, although would
 useful. policy actions control
 affect nonaccelerating rate inflation. think
 given us God; think etched stone; think
 given us Congress. think higher real minimum
 wages raise NAIRU lower real minimum wages lower NAIRU.
 go whole list things. right way
 improve loss function gain function room;
 Capitol Hill. Maybe part objective
 remind that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Although Humphrey-Hawkins Act
 fact full goals reduce them, think Governor Blinder
 did, two describe sustained economic growth price
 stability. find really single goal, since
 absolutely convinced best way achieve sustained economic
 growth price stability. prefer state objective
 price stability words rather numerical goal. believe
 achieving goal price stability, seek
 downward secular path inflation business cycle business
 cycle. goal means somewhat disinflation
 believe present level inflation at, say, 2-1/2 3
 percent higher one wishes either economic
 social reasons.
 question whole idea credibility. Nobody
 able prove credibility bought Bundesbank
 central bank benefit lower cost reduce inflation.
 fact, Stanley Fischer presented good paper 300th
 anniversary Bank England proving rather contrary.
 particular benefit so-called credibility, think
 credibility mainly makes central bankers feel better themselves.
 seems record Committee recent years
 good, better, central bank think of,
 including specifically Bundesbank. think would
 unconvincing public policy goal us position
 driving toward number inflation, presumably one
 could figure measure accurately would zero,
 know costs achieving would high very,
 uncertain benefits.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.

 MS. PHILLIPS. come slightly different
 ways. think important government entity quasigovernment entity, however classified, communicate longterm goals--which unlike mission statement kind
 entity would have. Inflation probably area
 control long run. think much
 control area employment long run, given fiscal policy
 effects. seems important us state clearly
 long-run goal control inflation. Now, certainly
 recognize, think Ed Boehne stated clearly, operate
 real world take account certain short-run
 issues, business cycle issues liquidity issues, whatever.
 seems make monetary policy decisions
 context long-term goal still true
 mission.
 look back period easing, one
 things looked at, think lot people around table
 looked at, kind progress making inflation. Even
 easing, still looking fundamentals
 price movements see whether would kind
 damage ultimate objective price stability. come
 importance expressing clearly control inflation
 major goal. clear mandate now. So,
 interim? Even existing Humphrey-Hawkins
 reports, think could start explicit looking
 perhaps range inflation measures. could look
 monitoring goal somewhat like way look monetary
 aggregates. Obviously, Congress ultimately going
 something say it, seems take
 initiative start working area, would
 driver's seat simply reacting piece legislation
 comes forward. Unless specific proposal us,
 certainly difficult say, yes, would
 that. general matter, think would important
 us communicate want control inflation, price
 stability long-term goal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, proposal balanced budget
 amendment implies abject admission total lack self
 discipline part Congress. think need

 justified said fail so.
 see commit kind objective long fiscal

 Governor LaWare said, FOMC implemented extremely well.
 record good, think opening trying
 make changes may raise problems want get
 into. type targeting numbers even
 ranges, require legislation. reason say
 targeting successful clearly would require
 efforts legislative branch, executive branch, course
 efforts. Looking experience countries
 reported staff paper, targets, could
 see every case central bank jointly
 finance ministry. Therefore, executive branch clearly tied
 it; central bank alone.
 countries, central bank independent. think clearly
 government-wide effort this; can't central
 bank alone reasons others mentioned here.
 numerical target, would concerned announced
 numerical target inflation would gain much
 also would limit flexibility. thinking
 talking staff, came conclusion Larry Lindsey
 came to, namely, choose nominal GDP target
 give us flexibility. problems nominal
 GDP, too. think would still escape hatch issue,
 although may severe choosing inflation target.
 nominal GDP target, still long-term
 inflation target within nominal GDP. Even then, could
 cases probably would go beyond nominal GDP target
 would lay advance. lay
 advance, affects credibility. Would people really believe
 this? Clearly, nominal GDP would much better long-term
 inflation target alone, going go route. also
 thought paper interesting noting New Zealand
 case, started bump inflation target,
 suggested redefining measured inflation exclude things
 affect prices.
 guess conclusion make changes
 unless necessary. respond legislation

 ratcheted cycle. seems
 one cycle away price stability current arrangements.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Listening really quite
 interesting. understand Committee difficulty
 confronting issue. split middle
 could possibly get. wonder, however, much
 difference real much imagined. reason put
 way ask periodically range actions
 available us, compare earlier period?
 strikes even though Federal Reserve
 independent institution legal sense, meaning
 decisions subject evaluation authorities,
 fact dependent culture philosophy
 society function. subliminal issue one needs
 exposed long time realize
 differences are.
 first got goverment 1974, inflation
 beginning take hold big issue. first time--I think
 may Rambouillet Summit 1977 Summit--it
 generally agreed among G-7 inflation cause
 unemployment. Now, extraordinarily unusual thought
 present earlier years. One could see changes
 beginning emerge. remember Arthur Burns, used
 visit quite often known since graduate school, would
 speak inflation like none us used hearing.
 one looks Federal Reserve period, antiinflation attitude scarcely seen policy
 numbers anything. ask myself, possible?
 stalwart inflation hawk look record. answer

 resembling price stability. Now, submit exactly
 did. follow price stability objective cyclical
 sense, is, one inflation rate going lower
 progressive cyclical peak lower progressive cyclical
 low. objective implemented straight line
 recognized, think correctly, Congress
 would give us mandate that.
 got legislation form of, say, something like
 Neal bill considerably watered version earlier Mack
 proposal, probably would useful us would give us
 particular goal. tried implement explicit
 form independently business cycle,
 suspicion would find support would

 last item today report Ted Truman
 developments Mexico last 48 hours so.
 MR. TRUMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. sure
 heard would like Mexico's situation last
 days weeks. Nevertheless, thought would useful
 summarize state play regard Mexican situation
 afternoon. touch five topics: first,
 apparently dead legislation U.S. Congress; second, total
 U.S. plan deal Mexican crisis would aided
 certain FOMC actions; third, IMF program; fourth, efforts
 mobilize forms multilateral support; finally, Bank
 Mexico's request make drawing existing Federal
 Reserve/ESF swap lines. need sense whether Committee
 inclined approve increase swap line.
 First, brief apparently dead
 legislation would provided $40 billion U.S.
 government guarantees Mexican government securities, prospects
 passage legislation gone steadily downhill since
 announced almost three weeks ago. Decisions made last night
 morning President bipartisan leadership
 stop pushing legislation. think fair say
 future legislation nonexistent, won't belabor
 point.
 Turning now, say anything more,
 would note acutely aware strongly held view
 Committee central bank expected underwrite
 foreign debt issues, large part covering debt
 obligations would involve inappropriate use central bank funds.
 said, U.S. authorities faced two broad alternatives
 became clear legislation would pass. could
 conclude tried failed Chairman called
 "least worse" approach, leave Mexico fend
 itself. Alternatively, could try help using approach
 feasible worse.

 MR. TRUMAN. end, second alternative chosen.
 materials distributed contain several items.
 first page statement President Congressional
 leadership. Despite note top, barely legible says
 new financing package hold yet
 cleared, package cleared. Attached
 summary currently proposed program, behind
 find President Clinton's speech morning National Governors
 Association announced change strategy. last
 item announcement Managing Director IMF
 morning regarding Mexican situation proposed IMF package.
 new approach would basically involve heavy use ESF
 lending Mexico form short-term swaps, medium-term swaps,
 possibly loans guarantees Mexican government securities.
 latter two types operations apparently legal ESF
 apparently also would set precedent. total could
 $20 billion. provide ESF necessary dollar liquidity
 undertake operations, Federal Reserve would asked

 ESF would take System obligation outstanding

 Committee action specific proposal today. However,
 increase Mexican swap line $6 billion would, opinion,
 reasonable long get take-out. also think limit

 $20 billion understanding special increase
 linked Mexican situation. also say
 understanding could situation could last
 long ten years. Committee may want discuss
 suggestions today vote tomorrow.
 third topic IMF program. Last Thursday,
 Mexican authorities announced agreement IMF management
 economic program support Mexico's stabilization efforts.
 program scheduled considered IMF Executive Board
 Wednesday first disbursement Friday, assuming program
 approved. program first proposed unprecedented
 size, absolutely relative Mexico's quota IMF.
 three times Mexico's quota, $7.7 billion, $3.9
 billion released approval program. economic
 content program tighter proposed Mexican
 authorities January 3rd terms fiscal policy parameters
 especially monetary policy parameters. surface
 program designed achieve macroeconomic objectives:
 terms growth, recall, Mexican program called
 growth 1-1/2 percent year year; inflation Mexican
 program set 19 percent December December; exchange

 implicit program notion some, probably all,
 objectives revised terms
 contingency arrangements program need
 tightened well.
 Following collapse U.S. legislative proposal,
 Managing Director IMF decided morning make two changes
 recommendations tomorrow respect program.
 first increase size program $10 billion,
 hopes finance non-BIS-member central banks.
 question point, funding obtained
 central banks governments, would come IMF's
 resources. Second, would IMF disburse full amount
 original program immediately.
 fourth topic, multilateral efforts,
 extraordinary size IMF's original program explained
 two factors. first recognition IMF management
 serious threat international financial system posed
 Mexican situation. second recognition need,
 especially perceived United States Congress, greater
 international "burden-sharing," call it, efforts
 stabilize Mexican financial markets.
 respect burden-sharing, Treasury
 discussing certain proposals central bank colleagues.
 first enlarge $5 billion $10 billion BIS facility
 favor Mexico agreed upon principle December 30th.
 second make financing BIS readily available
 meet current short-term financing needs. first point, BIS
 agreed increase, principle, could announced part
 package unveiled morning, although note
 language subsequent announcements suggests
 agreement actually exists, almost always case.
 less optimistic agreement second point.
 Treasury, technical support, also approached
 three groups countries ask assist Mexico.
 probably heard group Latin American countries-Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia--generally responded
 favorably, although modalities assistance yet
 agreed upon. addition, Treasury approached group
 countries Far East another group countries Middle
 East participation. suspect efforts rolled
 IMF endeavor raise additional $10 billion finance

 Last, know, Bank Mexico far drawn $1

 reserves tomorrow. Governor Mancera made urgent request
 allow drawing enable pad reserves somewhat.
 consultation Treasury, Chairman suggested

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since double collateral,

 MR. TRUMAN. would suggest, though maybe it's right
 thing suggest, would go first Treasury.
 Treasury went oil collateral, may use word,

 MR. HOENIG. say "go first Treasury,"

 MR. TRUMAN. hand, number $40
 billion plus $7 billion plus $5 billion. So, two totals
 broadly commensurate.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Ted, credibility problem along.
 want ask two questions. First, said Governor Mancera
 wants $2 billion pad balance sheet released
 tomorrow. Now, one things would useful
 long term would Bank Mexico provide honest
 description balance sheet us, would
 useful, public large.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 going stop?
 
 Absolutely!
 pad balance sheet tomorrow
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Governor Mancera conscious
 commitment announce reserves end every
 month. understanding people talked
 intention would say, last time Bank announced
 reserves--and small significant step forward--that
 reserves X include drawings North
 American swap lines Y.
 MR. LINDSEY.

 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 releasing Bank Mexico's
 
 yet, think part

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think find, Governor

 Street Journal today, going difficult say

 MR. LINDSEY.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 right.
 existed--and problem!
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Could clarify something?
 Governor Mancera said couple hours ago that,
 end day today informed United States
 willing make $2 billion available, would envision
 announces reserve figures say X, say $2.4
 $2.8 billion, addition, don't think get value
 today, agreement Federal Reserve
 Exchange Stabilization Fund additional $2 billion, value
 tomorrow presumably. lay accurately, think.
 MR. TRUMAN. think major concern--and
 partly addressed since tentatively plan, moment
 anyhow, lock funds--is announcing $2.4 billion
 reserves, given kind problems against, make
 look rather naked.
 MR. LINDSEY. second question
 credibility. don't know questions ask, hope
 help regard. document front me,
 includes page entitled "What Exchange Stabilization
 Fund?" document came Treasury International Affairs.
 gather written them.
 written enough know
 do, tell point view. Paragraph 3,
 mention dots indicating omission paragraph 2, got
 little nervous. Paragraph 3 says holdings ESF used
 enter swap arrangements foreign governments, finance
 exchange market intervention, provide short-term bridge finance,
 etc., things great. So, basically paragraph 3
 establishing unprecedented. question would be:
 nice things it's support dollar?
 unprecedented regard fact supporting
 another currency?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 language dots is--
 
 MR. LINDSEY. talking third paragraph.
 go second paragraph second. I'm sorry. running
 little order. saying ESF done things.
 MR. TRUMAN. legislation governing objectives
 ESF changed, think part mid- late-1970s.
 changes included language government United
 States International Monetary Fund obligation
 promote orderly exchange rate arrangements leading stable system
 exchange rates. interpreted include making loans
 Bolivia helping maintain system stable exchange rates.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 happened before?
 
 -69-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes. made loans financial
 arrangements least 37 countries around world last
 50 years.
 MR. LINDSEY. think asked questions
 this. read paper tell something
 missing know about, meaning
 truth whole truth?
 MR. TRUMAN. say Treasury lawyers looked
 question whether operations legal
 broad authorization purpose is-MR. MATTINGLY.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 help out?
 Yes.
 
 MR. MATTINGLY. It's pretty clear ESF operations
 authorized. don't think legal problem terms
 authority. statute broadly worded terms words
 like "credit"--it covered things like gold swaps--and
 confers broad authority. Counsel White House called
 Treasury's General Counsel today asked "Are sure?"
 Treasury's General Counsel said "I sure."
 Everyone satisfied
 legal issue involved, helps.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 anything missing page?
 
 MR. MATTINGLY. No, not. look last
 paragraph, example, part statute.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 notifying Congress writing advance?
 
 MR. MATTINGLY. statute says permission
 President make loans.
 MR. MELZER. penultimate paragraph,
 identified source repayment?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 
 Mexicans historically
 
 sensitive that. whole world informed
 oil payments assured method repayment. Mexicans,
 reasons would familiar given Mexican history,
 rather sensitive quite open
 now.
 
 MR. MELZER. legislation contemplate taking 100
 percent country's oil payments four years insure
 repayment?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 legislation--but operations three
 
 years.
 MR. STERN. indicated fact might
 way falls out.
 
 -70-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 MR. TRUMAN. trying live Governor Lindsey's
 entreaty suggest questions one could ask well
 answers.
 MR. MELZER. said might outstanding ESF

 MR. TRUMAN.

 SPEAKER(?).

 MR. TRUMAN. provision payment oil export

 MR. MELZER. don't mean that. ESF ever used
 provide financing, think said earlier possibility,
 outstanding long 10 20 years?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Ten.
 
 MR. MELZER. Ten years. precedent that?

 MR. TRUMAN. earlier ESF balances agreement also ran

 repayment guarantee.
 
 got involved offering us
 
 MR. MCTEER. May ask question $40 billion
 proposed legislation? believe legislation
 contemplate giving Mexicans money offering loan
 guarantees effect would substituted credit
 U.S. government credit Mexican government. Presumably,
 would roll short-term debt very, high
 interest rates default risk. point $40
 billion guarantee eliminate default risk lower
 
 interest rate structure?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 allow stretch debt--to
 
 replace short-term debt high rates long-term debt.
 MR. MCTEER. Okay. stopped talking $40
 billion; talking certain number billions
 whole nature changed. said going
 use money for? think it's different going
 given loan guarantee. strictly
 use intervene foreign exchange markets drive
 peso?
 MR. TRUMAN. think Treasury's intention secure
 financial plan Mexicans
 financing--that is, whole debt-management strategy. This,
 course, would worked agreement Treasury
 Mexicans would participate terms part
 that. would provided legislation, plan
 
 -71-

 MR. MCTEER. address credit risk problem,
 though. Anybody invests paper still

 MR. TRUMAN. Mexicans would effect substituting

 MR. BOEHNE.

 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, direct lending;

 this?
 
 MR. HOENIG. Ted, Federal Reserve involved
 liquidity problem ESF?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 involved two reasons.
 
 One, ESF
 
 liquidity, involves us warehousing.
 relates participation--this would short-term
 participation--through existing swap line, enlarged swap line,
 suggested super enlarged swap line.
 MR. HOENIG. latter would us involved long?
 ten years mentioned earlier?
 MR. TRUMAN. No, think one year. one
 reasons put specific proposal today.
 thinking, wanted tomorrow morning
 clearer head, might want set something
 could draw $6 billion. drawn $6 billion
 drawing outstanding 12 months would
 repaid, could redraw enlarged portion swap
 line. Committee would decide period--or maybe could
 two periods--the Mexicans would allowed draw
 enlarged swap line. point might allowed
 
 -72-

 roll drawing three times required repay
 unpaid balances. drawings repaid, enlarged swap
 facility would extinguished could redraw it.
 swap line would drop back normal swap line agreement
 drawings would require Committee clearance.
 MR. HOENIG.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Could ask question? Ted,
 slightly different issue. couple days ago rumors
 market reserves Mexican government dropped
 post devaluation levels $6 billion $2 billion.
 Bank Mexico immediately denied levels gone
 much. Now, tomorrow going announce roughly
 $2 billion reserves plus agreement get $2-1/2 billion
 us. still considerably $6 billion already
 lower earlier reserves. going happen?
 MR. TRUMAN. announced 9th January
 reserves $5.6 billion.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Yes, quickly denied
 reserves slipped $2 billion level.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 yesterday reserves $2
 
 billion.
 MR. FORRESTAL. question is:
 going market confidence?
 
 announcement
 
 MR. FISHER. don't think anyone thought five days ago
 reserves still $5 $6 billion.
 credibility loss closer $3 billion.
 Yesterday, market saying $2 billion;
 Mexicans denied said $3 billion. Now, one
 split hairs accounts, terms
 conversations us, $3 billion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 $3.4 billion.
 
 MR. FISHER. Yes, $3.4 billion. getting small
 numbers, one thinks credibility loss
 $6 billion earlier tomorrow announce $2
 billion.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 words, don't think
 announcement tomorrow way offset done
 President facility?
 MR. FISHER. It's going offset entirely. People
 will, people room did, sort take little breath
 say, well, low number. think President's package
 things come today mitigate
 effects great extent.
 MR. MELZER. implications Treasury
 dusting ESF provide liquidity ESF?

 Yes, Peter holds ESF.
 

 
 MR. FISHER. Yes, reasonably liquid instruments.

 think sum jumped today. dollar/mark today was--well,

 United States might selling marks yen immediately.
 Now, mostly skittish thing going rather anxious,

 MR. MELZER.

 MR. FISHER.
 
 Although might explain behavior
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. fair say policy measure, one
 reasons Treasury chose go loan guarantee
 originally rather using ESF going ESF,
 even cooperation, felt might sense
 ability defend dollar existing foreign exchange
 balances impaired. And, therefore, forced sell
 market, ability defend dollar subsequently would
 difficult without foreign exchange reserves, even aside one
 may think effectiveness intervention. Treasury

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Okay.
 
 Shall call evening?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. need sense Committee's view
 "drawing" whatever word want use.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. Ted indicated, think
 would useful context agree billion dollar lockup

 know everything place, would feel
 comfortable exposing even collateral.

 get take-out everything moving along, risk

 MR. HOENIG. ask you, say "lock up"-Are committing now? something that,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't think so.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. President Melzer said, previously--the action
 taken December 30th--you approved special increase
 Mexican swap line short period time.
 
 Now, fact
 
 drawings Mexico still within $3 billion swap line
 existed expanded special arrangement
 30th December. So, operating previously

 MR. HOENIG. understand hear Tom Melzer said.
 Chairman saying things changing quickly. Yes,

 February 1, 1995--Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since Mexican discussion may
 open-ended, thought would desirable put end
 agenda start morning's session Peter Fisher
 foreign currency domestic open market operations. Peter.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. referring
 eventually three colored charts single sheet paper
 distributed morning. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter, seen current account
 deficit United States rise continuously recent years.
 Projections suggest yearly deficits around $200 billion
 next couple years, evidence retreat.
 always conventional wisdom that, prominence
 dollar world portfolios, U.S. dollar driven largely
 portfolio shifts net flow claims United
 States, virtually dollars, really major
 force huge size stock. getting
 deficits $200 billion, strikes longer de minimis,
 curious know evaluate presumably depressing effect
 dollar cumulating current account deficits. would
 evaluate general effect deficits level
 trend? words, fully discounted market
 level issue? fully discounted,
 implying potential erosion stemming
 fact going borrow, net, $400 billion next two
 years?
 MR. FISHER. two aspects would focus on. One
 trend, point out. disturbing, important,
 foreign exchange market sense rising current account
 deficits; foreign exchange market sees trend current
 account dollar. forecasts
 stable $200 billion current account deficits 5 10 years,
 might something foreign exchange market eventually
 would adjust. So, think big component fact
 deficit seems ratcheting up, people market see
 process might stop. Obviously, level also important;
 past year, read heard
 table, combination current account deficit outflow
 U.S. savings search portfolio diversification abroad seen
 piling-on effect foreign exchange market. Market
 participants see demand dollars going

 certainly err direction interested
 micro mechanics markets, forgive me.
 think also important keep mind that, increasingly,

 questions Peter?
 
 MR. BLINDER. one. two parts, first
 probably unanswerable, want give shot, go
 ahead. question is: would imagine implications are,
 peso Canadian dollar, another 50 basis points
 federal funds rate?
 MR. FISHER. regard Canada, would expect
 Canadians add 50 basis points themselves. Bank Canada
 leaned strongly wind last weeks
 impressed markets. is, Bank Canada
 raised rates, market rates started come back down,
 Bank kept taking action make sure rates stayed up.
 done two three times, yield 30-year bonds fell 30 basis
 points. Bank Canada adjusted basis-point-for-basis-point
 us, think Canadian dollar would relatively stable
 U.S. dollar. don't mean jump much fun
 Committee morning, think important
 question compared what?
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Yes, compared zero.
 
 MR. FISHER. 50 basis point increase
 federal funds rate compared zero, think zero would quite bad
 Canadian dollar. also think markets would rather

 questions?
 
 Yes, Tom.
 
 MR. MELZER. understood Ted Truman say yesterday

 MR. BLINDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. pardon
 metaphor, would like see praise change
 Greenbook raise it.
 thought change nature
 Greenbook raised usefulness thinking policy next
 zero quite considerable level, small
 increment. that, read details, changed
 outlook somewhat want talk that.
 prepared Humphrey-Hawkins projection, like you,
 Greenbook staff
 work flowed Greenbook. talk
 moment. winged it, like us do; wrote 2-1/2
 percent growth forecast 1995, see puts
 squarely middle members' projections. Greenbook
 2.2 percent 1995, sounds like splitting hairs,
 assumes increase interest rates,
 guesstimate FOMC would do. Therefore, dutifully
 followed instructions embodied rate increases
 forecast. So, difference bit split hair.
 must say went details Greenbook
 line line--consumer durables, producer durables, government
 sector, works--I found difficult find piece GDP
 thought would grow faster Greenbook forecast. found
 extremely difficult make argument convince
 things look better Greenbook indicates lines 1, 2, 3, 4.
 led question could make numbers add

 belief forward momentum economy,
 several people also mentioned, sure colored view.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -98-
 
 Belief momentum gets things right time,
 believe it. always misses turns; always underestimates turns. us fall victim that, including me. know
 Humphrey-Hawkins projections today
 benefit Greenbook, would come lower
 week ago.
 Choosing two scenarios Greenbook terms
 preferences find easy call--I come back
 talk policy--in would prefer baseline scenario. Let
 say mean. believed Greenbook religiously, given
 two choices, would like baseline outcome lot better
 alternative, would characterize following financial
 markets. let leave later.
 difference two scenarios quantitatively,
 sticking positive economics, staff estimate decrement
 GDP growth tighter money: .3 percent 1995 1.1
 percent 1996.
 various staff members produce seven
 estimates parameter--that totals eight. Mike knows
 this; behind back. seven estimates
 clustered tightly around 1995 number, averaging decrement .4
 instead .3 percent.
 1996, estimates were,
 course, spread out, average extremely close 1.1
 percentage point difference see Greenbook.
 estimates vector auto regressions large
 macroeconometric models. gave lot confidence
 difference policy would make 10 minutes opening
 Greenbook. convinced best estimate
 could make decrement GDP growth tighter money.
 best estimate make quite different saying
 truth, course.
 key question front us now--that almost everybody
 around table spoken turn--is much
 slowdown expect without tightening, indeed
 tightening.
 
 think strong consensus,
 
 share, given dual objectives need slowdown 4.0
 percent growth rate 1994 something bigger 2-1/2 percent
 quite arguably, would say correctly so, less 2-1/2
 percent. question whether cards and,
 so, coming from. think coming three places
 want go that.
 First, coming swing inventories. find
 Greenbook forecast inventories reasonable, leaving aside
 timing; nobody clue timing, including Mike me.
 next four quarters, comparing fourth quarter 1994
 projection fourth quarter 1995, Greenbook forecast
 swing inventories clip 1-1/2 points
 GDP growth rate, is, comparing 1995 1994.
 Secondly, monetary policy, might guessed.
 asked staff answer following question me, got
 eleven different answers.
 eleven stem using different
 techniques answer question. question:
 Imagine that, instead easing monetary policy 1991 1992
 holding federal funds rate low 1993 tightening policy
 
 -99-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 last year, Open Market Committee simply locked
 constant real federal funds rate. simply would gone
 come up. One could call that, although guess don't use
 term anymore, "neutral" monetary policy. reason got
 eleven different estimates neutrality defined
 different levels; obvious one puts neutral. Also,
 different estimating techniques different
 macro models vector auto regressions. got eleven different
 estimates. compute effect difference policy
 growth 1994 growth 1995, subtract one
 get answer following question:

 difference monetary impulse, positive negative, hitting
 economy 1995 versus 1994? said, eleven different
 estimates number. won't surprise differ
 quite dramatically. highest number, comes staff's
 large econometric model, subtraction growth 2-1/2
 percentage points comparing 1995 1994. lowest number came
 Meyer model, 1/2 percentage point lower.
 numbers clustered that, done produce
 Humphrey-Hawkins table threw outliers looked
 central tendency, estimates decrement growth coming
 monetary policy would concentrated 1 1-1/2 percent range.
 conclude using number like 1 percent subtraction
 quite conservative, though quite minimalist, estimate
 decrement growth monetary policy recent years.
 third factor add list negatives
 Mexico; much way Peter Hooper earlier discussed,
 gives us number range 1/4 point. So, add up:
 1-1/2 percentage points inventories, 1 point monetary policy
 minimum, 1/4 point Mexico. gives me, say, 2
 percent 3 percent, correct add
 up; double-counting there. So, gives
 mental number ballpark 2 percent, plus minus, plenty
 error want emphasize, around that.
 Since starting 4
 percent, subtract something like 2 percent, leads
 conclusion good chance GDP growth 1995
 come 2-1/2 percent reasonable chance

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. second question: bank says
 customer, making line credit available
 soon repay it, goes away, discourages
 customer repaying last minute. sure
 particular piece described first page, paragraph 4,
 really interest, might want rethink that.
 MR. TRUMAN. two sides that. Peter
 discussed morning. decided two choices
 Committee would happier saying drawings got repaid
 total would get subtracted separate decision would
 made putting funds again. may piggyback bit
 question Governor Lindsey asked earlier fact
 swap drawings roll every three months, one found Mexico's
 reserves growing rapidly would scope encourage
 repay. could require repay could use moral
 suasion effort secure early repayment. might deal
 partly problem.
 SPEAKER(?). fact always structured
 rollover subject mutual consent.
 MR. TRUMAN. committing advance
 provide consent.
 SPEAKER(?). committing?
 committing Treasury committing Mexicans?
 think whole thing hang difference there. agree
 Treasury within Committee rules are,
 vis-a-vis relations Mexicans rewrite
 swap agreements, etc.-MR. TRUMAN. rewrite probably would say maturity
 three months renewal-SPEAKER(?). Three months agree renew.
 may discipline squares circle.
 
 So,
 
 MR. TRUMAN. However, doubt we'd want get
 situation use it. would end using moral
 suasion end three months rather whatever
 alternative is-SPEAKER(?).
 
 "Immoral" suasion!
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 --actually calling loan.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. May ask question mechanics?
 right draw period 12 months. let's say
 draw January 30th 1996; drawing could outstanding

 would happened previous arrangement Bank
 Mexico would gone U.S. government guarantee

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 still questions.
 
 get there, think Tom Melzer
 
 MR. MELZER. Let ask couple quick questions
 financial side think could helpful work
 arrangements sure understand. understand it,
 $20 billion warehouse facility, would
 advanced Mexicans would $14 billion. $6 billion-MR. TRUMAN.
 
 one way thinking it.
 
 MR. MELZER. $6 billion would retained ESF.
 time take swap out, effect warehouse
 remaining $6 billion pay off.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 would one scenario.
 
 MR. MELZER. seems
 requirement ESF retains good collateral $6 billion
 transaction get effected get taken out. sure
 take care that.
 don't know whether makes sense
 establish expectations. know annual reviews
 Committee warehousing facility. good
 establish expectations front would expect
 warehousing outstanding longer 10 years, example?
 sort expectations set respect
 possibility additional warehousing operations, say, unrelated
 Mexico?
 think said before, point view
 pretty much exhausts whatever flexibility ESF has, perhaps
 whatever perceive might warehouse them. Never say never,
 expectation ought another $20 billion
 behind one want intervene exchange markets.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 one reasons bringing
 
 up.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say something quickly?

 want that, get authorization new
 appropriated funds Congress. nothing us.
 MR. MELZER. talking expectations respect
 willingness warehouse anything beyond $20 billion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. MELZER.
 used assets.
 
 mean future?
 
 see saying; ESF
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes, would nothing left.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, following yesterday's discussion,
 want add two separate thoughts. One, far warehousing pesos,
 said no. think important consistency
 operation. technical matter, ESF still
 limited capacity acquire foreign exchange, yen DM,
 market. problem would worry right now,
 conceivably might point. might say
 bought another $5 billion worth yen want warehouse
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -135-
 
 Federal Reserve, too. Whether ESF would
 require separate decision Federal Open Market Committee. One
 reasons I, least, would favor putting place big
 number, matched big numbers terms
 program existing holdings foreign exchange,
 would make much clearer. slippery
 slope things billion billion
 extent avoided.
 question review, would think depends
 appetite Committee. Peter regularly reviewing foreign
 exchange market developments Committee, Mexico better
 worse inevitably going part months
 perhaps couple years. So, think lot
 opportunity Committee exercise oversight this.
 extent disbursements mount quickly, chance
 March find going on. staff make
 effort--as tried past though maybe always
 successfully--to keep Committee informed
 ongoing events minimize number surprises.
 probably won't surprises perfect crystal
 ball!
 MR. MELZER. One last question couple
 comments would like make. excess
 collateral terms backing U.S. currency. recall
 warehoused lot foreign currencies ESF before, got
 problem fairly narrow excess collateral.
 $20
 billion, effect substitute foreign currency
 holdings domestic securities. sell domestic
 securities, less viewed acceptable
 collateral back currency. exceed limits,
 announce Congress backing Federal reserve notes
 types assets. likelihood make
 sort announcement?
 MR. KOHN. know current situation is.
 guess is--and wild guess--that warehousing got
 $20 billion, could situation.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 Congress.
 said Congress
 last collateralize
 
 don't think obligation announce
 obligation sense Governor Partee
 would use foreign exchange holdings
 Federal Reserve notes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. get point, always
 off-market swap Japanese Germans.
 MR. MELZER. trying understand
 implications this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. balance sheets implications.
 last time happened five years ago, recall.
 MR. MELZER. Yes, seasonal thing,
 time year got close exhausting regular note
 collateral--I think $9 billion warehousing
 balance sheet.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -136-
 
 MR. TRUMAN. know whether scale
 things increased enough since combined fact
 reserve requirements come would room.
 MR. KOHN. Brian Madigan said thought projection
 free collateral $8 $10 billion indefinite period.
 MR. MELZER. terms feelings this, Alan,
 respect point view this, really heard
 anyone make case facing sort
 financial crisis United States systemic implications.
 think really talking about--when say we, saying
 broadly--is providing long-term financing
 another country mismanaged financial affairs.
 Treasury wants that, prerogative.
 appropriate central bank participate directly
 indirectly arrangements, think setting bad
 precedent. Now, know technically way appears
 surface Treasury facilitating it.
 think perception going much full
 partner this.
 thing concerns use warehousing
 arrangements. know, criticized past
 warehousing arrangements used facilitate "normal"
 transactions whose purpose stabilize dollar exchange markets.
 talking totally different type
 facilitation, much larger-sized. gets back second risk

 may subject us even criticism inasmuch Congress
 American people apparently strongly oppose extending credit
 Mexico. effect, one could argue would participating
 effort subvert public, will.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seriously doubt that, Tom.

 -137-
 
 MR. MELZER. understand think people

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. trying say that,
 possibly talk concern, one think frankly
 really de minimis. want something worry about,
 lots things would like worry about. one
 them. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, think questions
 answered. general understanding proposed here.
 two aspects this: One contain immediate crisis

 believed Mexican situation containable, short
 something nature, fingers structure
 things falling apart. One argue quite credibly
 fault theirs. problem is, use another analogy,

 specific request, agree Chairman.
 First all, problem two
 pieces paper. don't think problem many
 reasons stated. third piece paper

 know is.
 MR. BLINDER. Exactly. would like attach urgency
 request. Several us buzzing informally
 around here. longer reverberates press--that
 Federal Reserve that--the worse gets,
 want it, perfectly
 want it.
 fine.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Let's find is.
 
 Let give two-part answer.
 
 MR. BLINDER. sidebar question, would like
 know, hopefully could known soon, says, "the
 Federal Reserve monitor" whether means Board
 Governors Federal Reserve, Chairman Board
 Governors Federal Reserve, Federal Open Market Committee,
 maybe choice. can't imagine choice.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think lot things
 going decide today quickly.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 really would like know answer that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. first thing planning
 meeting address question talking
 Treasury others involved process.
 MR. BLINDER. second question--I guess really
 question--is information since least peripherally
 involved agent. understanding
 putative strategy is?
 Presumably, someone goes deal like
 this, notion strategy. $20 billion, $6
 billion share presumably usable Bank
 Mexico exchange stabilization, sees fit.
 $14 billion could take form loan guarantees; also
 could also used exchange stabilization; could used
 long-term lending. Maybe left something out,
 three things Treasury sheet. legislative plan $40
 billion loan guarantees.
 MR. TRUMAN. legislative plan, still
 question Mexicans going money.
 think question similar one President Minehan
 asking earlier:
 going use money, whether
 funds short-term longer-term funds? seems
 financial plan referred earlier comes in.
 related question involvement monitoring
 economic policy side.
 Indeed, major rationale
 involved monitoring economic policy side without
 
 -139-
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 involvement, could advance money--whether it's
 short term, medium term, long term, money could easily
 frittered away. two interact.
 MR. BLINDER. bothers us directly pledge
 monitor something something happen. Treasury
 lending money, political reasons not.
 responsibility monitoring; don't think business
 it. name eighty-seven things U.S. trade policies
 think horrible, political decisions
 nothing Federal Reserve.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Well, name eighty-seven, too.
 name eighty-seven!
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Still, even trade policies go wrong,
 go wrong, impact Federal Reserve
 Mexico economic
 financial system relatively minor.
 financial policies go wrong next millenium,
 immediately next two three years, think
 major impact Federal Reserve, whether wearing banksupervisory hat financial-system-stability hat,
 macroeconomic-policy hat.
 think Federal Reserve
 concerned Mexican Treasury spends money, one way
 other. would prefer concern put neon lights,
 think concerned.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 agree first
 question answer. tell one small
 element this, however--or give position. respect
 International Monetary Fund, somewhat similar
 position, though slightly different scale, relative
 Congress. International Monetary Fund got
 situation essentially December. realized knew less
 going Mexico did. knew great deal
 less wished known, even though devoted
 considerable amount resources daily basis least
 last year. IMF know Peter Fisher
 colleagues well people Board much better
 contacts information day-to-day operations Mexico
 Fund has. two reasons:
 First all, Fund,
 better worse, culture designed
 follow day-to-day developments individual economies member
 nations. Secondly, side, Mexicans world
 champions terms obfuscating economic information
 simultaneously providing lot information. Transparency
 way economic policy conducted Mexico, including monetary
 policy, serious problem, one relates
 comment earlier functioning financial markets well
 comments--what Governor Lindsey asking yesterday--concerning
 balance sheet Bank Mexico top bottom.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -140-
 
 extend Chairman Greenspan's analogy step further--maybe
 taking step back--once put house fire out,
 want build fire-proof house want try encourage
 resident house stop smoking least stop smoking
 bed. think interest getting done,
 going create mistake-proof economic environment Mexico
 create mistake-proof economic environment
 United States. hope effort considerable
 expenditure Federal Reserve resources--I mean human resources
 budgetary resources one sense--to fix things least
 problems coming back.
 Let come back another point resources.

 reasons Governor Blinder stated, concerns
 monitor monitor have, among
 things, resource implications Federal Reserve System.
 want know whether going budget one man year
 forty-two man years get job done right. need know
 minimum going asked do, see whether
 feasible terms resources and, Governor Lindsey
 Chairman said, terms intellectual feasibility.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, two points:
 big "P"
 political point small "p" political point. First, find
 uncomfortable disagreeing you. Pat Buchanan good
 quote Wall Street Journal day. talking
 collapse Mexican bailout bill. said
 first complete rout governing elite since League Nations
 went defeat. Now, Mexican bailout.

 1919, probably would League
 Nations. So, side governing elite.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Pat Buchanan governing
 elite, too. doing?
 MR. LINDSEY. Well, running us.
 political
 risk going come chairmen senior members
 current majority. political risk comes people
 country damn mad. bill opposed defeated,
 governing elite, use Pat Buchanan's phrase, said effect:
 going win anyway going go around
 normal processes pull money little pot people never
 knew even existed use money. Well, maybe everyone
 forget it, don't think so.
 think where-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 work.
 
 works won't
 
 MR. LINDSEY. work we--and cannot imagine
 greater governing elite group institution--and governing
 elites going microscope.
 much agree
 point made earlier obviously elite,
 elites come question, functions going revised
 Congress. political risk enormous.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -141-
 
 second point would make that, frankly, given
 examples Camdessus memo, treated--to borrow
 phrase--a lot like mushrooms. thing that,
 think, maximize little bargaining power
 it. happen maximum bargaining power right now.
 approve two documents, problem
 themselves, bargaining power left. So, would modify
 pace Governor Blinder said things request
 get answers questions ratify this. Now,
 could even make motion approve subject getting
 "third page," use phrase. approve these,
 bargaining power, people committing us
 without consent unlimited capacity commit us
 things.
 think
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. disagree that.
 bargaining power changed. think bargaining power
 essentially ability say engage in,
 accept, monitoring x, y, z. veto is.
 documents basically facilitating United States Treasury
 United States government. way either
 enhances reduces bargaining power. think bargaining
 power based solely ability say no.
 say say
 such, ultimate leverage
 Treasury nothing that,
 starting original hypothesis, reason involved
 credibility. really don't think get
 bargaining power because, point view
 Treasury, giving something us deal,
 way around. removing modest degree credit risk
 existing arrangement. thing
 seen agreement acquiescing removing
 financial risk central bank deal.
 think
 going acquiesce individual items,
 would commit everyone say "no."
 don't
 see could it.
 would hold approval
 proposals up; willing go along; agree. two
 documents favor, way around. would
 little concerned holding documents
 like fact sitting half billion dollar
 exposure alleged "collateral." Let us get behind us.
 President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, briefly, certainly
 respect point view, think understand fully
 difficult position System put in. take
 consideration. still make brief comment
 general support Tom Melzer's position Larry Lindsey's
 position. uncomfortable this.
 sure that,
 formal matter, proposing legal. see
 it, action--the whole package--is reasonable definition
 substance fiscal action, monetary policy action.
 therefore province Congress. Congress
 take think agree appropriate action,
 left holding bag. guess see raid
 independence, regret it.
 agree risk
 us, think substantial, probably remote, although I'm
 sure think remote do.
 
 1/31-2/1/95
 
 -142-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'm sure think remote
 Governor Phillips.
 [Laughter]
 think either!
 MS. PHILLIPS. question meant reflect
 two propositions actually agree them. would
 happen Fed go along either increase $6
 billion warehousing? Treasury contemplating covering
 going elsewhere warehousing? would
 mechanics?
 MR. TRUMAN. technical matter, declined
 warehousing pulled existing swap agreement, leaving
 aside moment hypothetically already involved
 $4.5 billion, Treasury presumably would alone!
 collateral would improved arrangement, let's suppose
 starting square one, square one probably us going
 back 1967, never dealings Mexico.
 going done via State Department
 Treasury Department. Treasury would take $20 billion
 directly without us temporary junior partner
 swap side it.
 warehousing side it, principle,
 Treasury could find means move $20 billion foreign
 exchange balance sheet. would obvious
 principle could it.
 said "no."
 Chairman suggested, perhaps could warehousing
 Bank Japan Bundesbank. I'm quite sure
 would that, principle could it.
 principle,
 could warehouse BIS, BIS could warehouse
 Street. options are, standpoint, maybe
 preferable far concerned. would even argue
 illustrate fact fairly straightforward set
 financial transactions. fact could done
 private sector suggests perhaps normal, less
 abnormal, people think is.
 principle walk
 away sides that, Treasury would go ahead
 anyhow. That's thought.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Okay, Jerry Jordan, go ahead.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Last March entered agreement
 swaps, part agreement would threecountry consultation process quarterly on.
 certainly
 feel either quantity quality information
 feedback whatever consultation taking place alert us

 get lot better information. come
