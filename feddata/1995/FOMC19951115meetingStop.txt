 MS. MINEHAN. informal understandings
 central banks, Bank Japan, run

 central bankers approach Desk ask guarantee

 quibbles, particularly international side, one major
 concern consumer debt situation. continue
 robust forecast robust debt growth. Greenbook

 18-1/2 percent. One way looking 40 percent

 Greenbook reason going problems
 two-fold: first, think quality income consumers
 receiving makes debt level worse perceived
 be; and, second, view stock market
 panacea deterioration liability side. don't believe
 accurate.
 Let start income situation. Although personal
 income rising respectable rate, personal income
 flows spendable income consumer. Although
 true wages, true substantial portions interest
 dividends. One check simply look income tax
 data. Now, receive ten dollars year either

 So, question evasion; received interest dividend

 Yet, 30 percent personal interest income reported income

 50 percent dividends 65 percent business income.
 define spendable income, either include transfers
 include transfers. numbers don't include transfers,
 doesn't change story. get picture
 income situation suggests lot less spendable income
 perceived.
 disturbing fact. disturbing time
 relationship spendable income disposable personal income
 deteriorating. example, spendable income 1988,
 defined adjusting actually flows household
 checking accounts, amounted 61 percent disposable personal
 income.
 1995, fell 57.4 percent. roughly
 6 percent decline base, would call denominator,
 using measure debt service burdens. means
 18-1/2 percent scored second quarter
 year ratio debt disposable personal income that,
 adjusting deterioration composition income, would
 really number like 19.7 percent. would record high
 substantially anything seen. Obviously,
 average spendable income disposable personal income falling,
 even worse margin, last year worst year
 date.
 second issue whether substantial stock market
 gains could fact offset deterioration household
 liability side. obvious statement say people
 stocks people credit card debt.
 take
 careful look distribution stock market wealth, becomes
 increasingly implausible believe rise stock market wealth
 could actually cause kind sustained expansion
 
 11/15/95
 
 consumer spending. example, 31 percent dividends go .8
 percent households top income distribution half
 dividends go people 65.
 Actually, among non rich,
 substantially half dividends go people 65.

 don't know detailed studies marginal propensity
 consume, counting stock market wealth, I'm
 using dividends apportion, dividends would rough signal
 lot increase stock market wealth is--I'm going use
 word--"wasted" people unlikely spend large portion
 certainly unlikely people running
 consumer debt. try probe little further, fact
 stock market wealth going leading cause consumption
 expansion, would expect permeate least
 $75,000 $100,000 income class. 4 million households income range; 4 million households
 richer that. talking 92nd 96th
 percentiles household income.
 expecting wealth-led
 increase consumption, clearly benefit. Yet half
 households income class receive dividends all,
 suggesting stock market wealth. 71 percent
 households category age 65 receive dividends all,
 suggesting stock market wealth. remaining 29
 percent category--about 1 million households received
 dividends--the average dividend $3,000. median dividend
 $600.
 figure 40:1 price dividend
 ratio, would mean even among 30 percent
 relatively wealthy class got dividends owned stock,
 portfolio $25,000. gain portfolio

 expect small group small

 So, believe problems acknowledge
