 MR. TRUMAN. Remember, first phase whereby
 Committee initially activated existing $3 billion. Then,
 end December 1994, effort deal problem

 done--the thing think right--was Peter

 meant therefore much easier ad hoc contacts.
 So, one element come process.

 MR. TRUMAN. don't know whether that's sole roadblock,
 that's issue wanted surface. staff felt

 MR. PRELL. One feature latest forecast change

 So, Mike, disagree you. don't see

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let note another channel

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. four general points
 make today. first Eighth District economy continues
 grow moderate pace. District retailers expect holiday
 season somewhat better last year's. half District
 auto dealers report autumn sales levels last year,
 extent sales damped, one often-cited factor
 shortages popular trucks mini vans. Industry contacts continue
 report slow, steady growth, although contractions continue
 apparel, shoe manufacturing, coal mining industries.
 pace
 residential construction slowed slightly, multifamily
 construction picking slack areas. Nonresidential
 construction continues bright spot many parts
 District. Overall loan demand remains healthy signs
 softening, District banks continue post record profits.
 might mention couple bankers board expect possible
 mini mortgage refinancing boom get started early next year.
 evidence starting now. informal survey District
 contacts reveals labor problems various kinds,
 shortages, unqualified applicants, retention affecting many
 businesses.
 Reports tight labor markets, defined shortage
 available qualified workers, concentrated areas southern
 parts District, especially northwest central Arkansas,
 northern Mississippi, western Tennessee. contacts believe
 shortage acute discouraging firms
 expanding operations setting new operations affected
 areas. added number firms begun import foreign labor
 fill positions.
 second major point long-term inflation outlook
 inconsistent Committee's price stability goals.
 central concern FOMC progress toward price stability
 seems little public confidence substantial gains
 front made anytime foreseeable future.
 long-term inflation forecasts horizons five years
 indeed adjusted downward last year. generally
 forecasts still show market participants expect inflation
 current levels well next century. One forecast
 released October Blue Chip group. consensus forecast
 consumer price inflation average 3.2 percent annually
 year 2006.
 Livingston Survey Economists released
 yesterday predicts similar 3 percent rate period,
 University Michigan Survey Consumers 3
 percent figure, according preliminary December data.

 addition, wage pressures may remain quiescent
 next year, something think puzzled
 extent given reported tightness labor markets
 time. recent settlement workers Boeing was,
 view directors, surprisingly rich. Bob Parry
 mentioned, included lump sum payment 10 percent first
 year, 4-1/2 percent lump sum payment second year, general
 wage increases 3 percent years three four, and, haven't
 able nail down, one individual mentioned
 general wage increases appeared top cost-of-living
 increases.
 try nail down. Finally,
 major reversal company plans shift medical costs
 employees. gone trying shift costs insured
 health care employee actually paying substantial bonus
 employees opt HMOs, shifted costs workers
 traditional plans. afraid settlement could
 harbinger things come. Stubbornly high inflation expectations
 possible future wage increases led view current
 situation window opportunity. Ed Boehne mentioned fluid
 expectations.
 think real side. would
 also say expectations could quite fluid respect
 inflation. Moves place downward pressure inflation
 expectations might pay handsome dividends future. FOMC,
 agree Al Broaddus said minute ago, develop
 plan move toward price stability offer markets
 convincing evidence intend achieve goal
 reasonable timeframe.
 think specific objective would go long
 way direction.
 third major point national economy seems
 growing near post-war average. private forecasters predict
 stable sustainable growth real output 1997.
 Blue
 Chip group, example, foresees growth 2-1/2 percent
 end 1996, majority respondents expect growth
 continue 1997.
 unemployment rate low belies
 predictions imminent weakness. index leading indicators,
 course, falling 1995, almost
 decline dominated changes prices sensitive
 materials. rate increase materials prices, think,
 merely tapering rapid pace set 1994
 
 fact could interpreted positive factor economy,
 negative. rally longer-term bonds mostly good news
 1996 growth prospects. help housing industry well
 business investment may lead, mentioned before, new wave
 mortgage refinancing.
 final point recent trends financial markets
 seem consistent continued expansion, think point
 Mike made earlier briefing. Aggregate credit remains readily
 available even though growth total bank loans slowed recently
 firms turned longer-term capital markets.
 addition,
 growth M2 since beginning 1995 seems consistent
 economy growing potential. marked runoff total reserves
 last two years, albeit distorted spread sweep
 accounts, cause concern. balance, however, growth
 monetary aggregates supports expectation continued moderate
 expansion nominal GDP. Thank you.

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, Tenth District economy remains

 little concern raised consumer spending fiscal

 indeed increased relative income, historical

 Also, assume consumer debt burdens excessive,

 think gone end 1996 even assuming

 MR. KOHN. think circumstances would

 MR. JORDAN. Maybe answered matrix

 Starting

 say, without economic slack occurring forecast, move

 MR. KOHN. think two points. One would

 slack economy. react get rid slack,
 meanwhile running potential would put downward
 pressure inflation. think opportunistic strategy
 take downward pressure. Don't try push economy back

 people around table think happened recently.
 inflation expectations come down, would put downward
 pressure inflation process. Governor Yellen mentioned
 remarks, truly come particularly
 process declining further, would enable hold
 economy potential inflation come further. Now,
 whether could logically count much sort immaculate

 second set comments:
 opportunistic strategy, like Bill McDonough favor, waiting
 unanticipated happen. sense right, except
 know happen. think go
 next thirty years without recession. don't know
 recession come, know come. also know
 comes, even opportunistic way describe
 here, react fast enough stop tracks. So,
 recession period slack.
 lot us mean say "one recession away
 price stability."
 takes nimble central bank move
 fast enough avoid slack drags inflation point
 two points recession occurs. happen probability
 one. So, unanticipated long-run sense;
 unanticipated timing. That's crucial because,
 literally unanticipated, might never get price stability
 opportunistic strategy.
 also couple quarrels way think
 portrayed strategy. Although discussion Jerry Jordan
 went way, thought said looking back
 inflation performance rather looking forward inflationary
 expectations.
 would thought would wanted
 latter--to look forward inflationary expectations, backward
 actual performance. Secondly, think matrix, think
 it, quite right terms changes versus levels. is,
 "tighten" "tight" "easier" "easy," speak, two
 different things.
 would thought question whether
 wanted "tight" "easy."
 imagine easing
 tight position, imagine tightening easy position.
 Either could still leave policy side neutral. think

 MR. KOHN. thought effect that's lower
