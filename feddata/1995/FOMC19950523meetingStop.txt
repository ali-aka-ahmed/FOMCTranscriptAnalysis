 MR. JORDAN. Mike, questions really along
 lines Mike Moskow asked earlier. response

 MR. BROADDUS. Current economic conditions near-term

 Also, tourism, increasingly important industry part
 country, stronger time last year.
 So, again, activity District mixed. usually try avoid
 using word "mixed" describing economy since vague,
 think that's essentially region right now.
 Turning national economy, Greenbook forecast
 broadly line forecasts seen
 certainly plausible. calling almost perfect landing,
 
 5/23/95
 
 -12-
 
 super soft landing, one naturally wonder might go
 wrong. see two distinct somewhat sequential risks, use
 phrase, period ahead. First, seems
 clear, near-term downside risk. Greenbook, everyone
 knows, projecting sharp reduction GDP growth second
 third quarters producers work inventories down. risk,
 course, slow growth jobs incomes presumably
 accompany inventory correction may frighten consumers
 possibly precipitate reduction spending. turn,
 could induce producers cut output further. So, could get kind

 even moderately higher--say, inventory correction

 longer. event could see considerable buildup
 inflationary momentum. happens, could difficult

 possibility important us let current
