 mr. jordan. coupl question. i'm sure
 whether first on mike tom. go back chart 8
 real interest rate fiscal scenario compar
 statement greenbook, i'd like littl
 elabor. make refer call fiscal restraint.
 understand suppos mean. describ
 greenbook, fiscal restraint effect lower equilibrium
 real rate . normal, peopl would think lower interest
 rate, real nomin, mean easier monetari polici. so, tighter
 fiscal polici caus easier monetari polici.
 mr. prell.
 mr.
 jordan.
 
 let interrupt there.
 okai.
 
 mr. prell. want make clear could--and
 guess w fail--or mayb clearli could
 wasn't clear enough! didn't mean adjust
 nomin rate, took reflect chang
 natur r :e, view monetari stimulu. effect, keep
 thing neutral fiscal restraint tend lower natur
 rate--the rate would prevail economi steadi
 state, oper potenti. apolog confus
 score. fact, recogn someth
 think rais last meet high real shortterm rate expect longer run whether
 felt 3 percent, wherev real rate is, sustain

 becom relev consider. said felt higher
 longer-run equilibrium natur rate prior
 bluebook simul introduc downward tilt. sinc
 go bit bluebook simul
 build somewhat substanti fiscal consolid, felt
 would appropri us introduc
 forecast. so, that's interpret.
 mr. jordan. okai, absolut problem
 that. still littl problem refer bond
 bond market ralli
 market adapt. it's like sai:
 enough, don't lower fund rate, give
 littl problem. let hold second. greenbook
 sai:
 "we introduc downward tilt fund rate.
 declin rate, though, interpret impli
 impetu aggreg demand," mean downward movement
 would equilibr. read statement sai also
 natur wicksellian rate equilibrium real rate move
 down, failur move nomin rate would de facto
 restrict polici stanc.
 mr. prell.
 
 assum inflat expect remain constant.
 
 mr. jordan. so, whatev caus equilibrium rate move
 down--fiscal polici, god, someth--you would sai, even though
 headlin mai sai lower nomin rate eas, failur
 lower nomin rate fact restrict.
 mr. prell.
 mr. jordan.
 
 that's right.
 okai.
 
 mr. prell.
 emphas that, given limit
 abil predict relationship, calibr
 clearli uncertain. think point tom's present here,
 schemat on sens, simpli larg
 anticipatori reaction bond market, need
 move short rate aggress order give greater
