 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry?
 
 MR. PARRY. Dave, would like ask two questions
 labor force developments. sure know, last year
 lot volatility participation rates

 wonder staff thoughts going

 possible somewhat greater elasticity
 participation rate current 5.7 percent unemployment rate

 MR. STOCKTON. first part, less puzzled

 therefore leave unemployment rate less important
 indicator labor market slack point. one can't rule
 possibility.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. couple questions. First, Charlie,
 international side: regard industrial nations,
 looked projections couldn't discern reasons
 expecting improvement economic activity. based
 general cyclical notion economies growing
 slowly, all, bound better future
 something fundamental going led believe
 going better?
 MR. SIEGMAN. partly slowdown first
 half may well aberration respect underlying trends
 underlying strength countries. German economy felt
 impact depreciation mark, partially
 reversed. anticipate Japanese policy measures well,
 although projected slow Japanese performance. So,
 correction weakness first half don't
 expect continue.
 MR. STERN. Second question: don't fully understand it,
 gather BEA going use chain-weighted index
 deflate GDP lower previous estimates real GDP,
 significantly cases. also mean productivity
 estimates going come significantly? so,
 really credible?
 MR. STOCKTON. taken look trend productivity

 MR. SLIFMAN. Let add one comment works

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Dave, outlined downside upside
 risks, didn't mention guessed would start with,
 fiscal situation. Greenbook
 forecast DRI framework, gives majority probability
 forecast, and, say, alternatives, said:
 forecast probability P1 forecast probability P2,
 P1 P2 add .3, would say
 fiscal situation?
 MR. STOCKTON. sure particular
 political forecasting acumen could predict fall's budget
 negotiations going unfold. Obviously, best estimate
 highest probability estimate agreement reached
 fourth quarter avoid dire fiscal scenarios
 mentioned. Clearly, tremendous amount
 uncertainty actually occur.
 MR. BLINDER. getting this: one
 alternative forecast fiscal contraction,
 another less fiscal contraction.
 MR. STOCKTON. Right. would say still showing
 less fiscal restraint forecast embodied budget
 resolution passed Congress. Therefore, end almost
 exactly budget resolution shows, probably would show
 slightly weaker activity next year currently forecasting.
 typically, even budget plans
 put table, everything added end,
 usually comes shy thought everybody signed
 deal. felt comfortable that. guess probability
 tighter fiscal policy forecast somewhat higher
 probability looser fiscal policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Moskow.
 
 MR. MOSKOW. gets back Bob Parry's question

 Finally, recent slowdown real GDP growth help

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, want take Governor
 Blinder's question Dave Stockton's answer regarding risks
 fiscal policy. surprise fiscal
 policy talked year.
 would like start
 two observations. first level
 deficit reduction talking about. Now, lot ways
 looking budgets, word baseline lot meanings.

 like think baseline would spending
 adjusted inflation demographic changes without changing
 law. number $20 billion higher baseline
 staff using. So, Greenbook refers $30 billion
 deficit reduction baseline, really talking $50
 billion reduction think current services baseline.
 talk House Senate budget resolutions,
 $50 billion budget deficit reduction, really talking
 $70 billion reduction. numbers keep mind
 talking "real" money might think,
 use Senator Dirksen's phrase.
 Second, look back this,
 think going happy second-quarter pause happened
 second quarter fourth quarter first
 quarter 1996 think fiscal contraction going
 coupled random events inventory correction,
 happen coincidentally, would lead much worse problems
 thought. agree Dave Stockton don't particular
 expertise fiscal side.
 don't think anyone real
 insight process going work out. decided
 cynical it.
 decided elected representatives may
 something minds purely national interest.
 talked pollsters political advisers parties,
 actually independent.
 asked poll
 numbers could see exactly seeing
 make judgments accordingly.
 first thing hear talking anyone
 importance Perot voters. One watch parade
 Dallas understand important are. So, going focus
 Perot voters. called radical center--I don't
 know that's right phrase. Demographically,
 middle class voters: 37 percent incomes
 $40,000 $80,000 range versus 28 percent voters.
 also less religious voters; 47 percent admitted going
 church least monthly versus 38 percent voters,
 percent voters go weekly well
 general public. important characteristics keep mind.
 also decidedly anti-government Republican voters,
 becomes interesting. asked federal
 government much power, Democrats thought yes, 63 24;
 
 8/22/95
 
 -22-
 
 Republicans said yes, 79 17; Perot voters replied yes, 88 9.
 pre Ruby Ridge question was:
 Would actively resist government
 thought threatening rights?
 "Actively resist"
 pretty strong phrase. Perot voters said yes, 57 34.
 think
 government partner opponent pursuit
 American dream? Perot voters said opponent, 71 23.
 government hurt help people like you? Democrats split
 evenly. Republicans said "hurt," 50 36, Perot voters said
 "hurt," 51 24.
 welfare state? two
 choices:
 government take care people can't take
 care themselves; groups like Salvation Army and/or
 United Way would better job. Democrats like government, 48
 39; Republicans like private sector, 61 25; Perot voters
 like private sector, 67 18.
 even need federal
 government provide social safety net? Democrats said yes, 53
 33; Republicans said no, 60 36; Perot voters said no, 68 24.
 questions, Perot voters right
 Republican voters. even case
 regulations. regulations cause significant job losses? Perot
 voters agreed, 71 24, Republicans. increase
 cost things buy? Perot voters said yes, 83 12,
 among Republicans. something maybe Fed
 keep mind: much trust regulators act
 interest Americans? split great deal
 fair amount versus much none. Among Perot voters
 largest category none, negative, 54 16.

 key spending issue Medicare, choice was:
 Would want
 tinker--to people said yes--leave alone, completely
 redesign. public general split 21/20 leaving alone versus
 completely redesigning. Perot voters completely redesigning,
 30 14.
 given choice reforming Medicare control
 costs using money allocated tax cuts rich maintain
 current Medicare system, split 3 1 favor reform
 using tax cuts rich. numbers
 Republicans Congress particular focusing since
 voters ones gave majority. Perot voters 1992
 split evenly among parties; went 2 1 Republicans
 last election.
 first conclusion pollsters analysts
 Republicans think deliver budget cuts keep
 voters. second decline Republican
 numbers since January result budget-cutting process
 slowing wrong thing. Independents,
 example, asked whether Congress stalling going fast.
 said stalling, 43 30.
 Third, GOP freshmen far
 Perot-like. Secretary Rubin spoke freshman class try
 talk approving debt ceiling. came away
 shocked; word given. 160 members
 House Representatives signed names something
 says raise debt ceiling unless
 balanced budget resolution it.
 People parties gave
 flat prediction debt ceiling bill pass House
 Representatives unless also balanced budget resolution
 go it.
 Fourth, specific bureaucratic cuts going
 reduced. are, numbers suggested, even popular among
 Perot voters among Republican voters. Finally, shutting

 government perceived posing little risk. might get
 sense looking vote bill limit
 authority use Exchange Stabilization Fund House passed
 100 votes.
 Democrats' constituency best served saying
 problem, fact case. Remember,
 Democrats talking survivors don't need
 go Perot voters. Gephardt says problem,
 example, Medicare fact angry President
 said was. look Democratic voters, get

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. quick comment quick question.
 comment noticed changes way Bluebook
 constructed way presented information,
 thought useful constructive, Don. question had:
 significant backup long-term interest rates
 intermeeting period, 35 basis points long end yield
 curve. wasn't whole lot discussion that.
 interpret backup part, maybe largely, change
 inflation expectations psychology market, albeit shortterm one. It's hard see real rates would move
 quickly. Much took place short period time-shortly data began come stronger. see
 way?
 MR. KOHN. would say, President Broaddus, see
 much mixture, perhaps little emphasis
 real rates exclusively real rates. is, think
 information hit us market intermeeting period
 real growth stronger old interest rates
 expecting. classroom jargon, curve bit
 thought. would suggest fact real
 interest rates need higher business cycle keep
 economy potential. look pattern forward
 rates, lot bulge forward rates intermeeting

 don't inflation-indexed bonds. Given economy
 stronger, think it's logical inflation expectations might
 revised least little, would put much emphasis
 real side inflation expectations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Don, first wanted comment
 really appreciated remarks made respect Bluebook.
 must say read discussion real rates Bluebook
 got headache! think really red
 view real rates, like real variables, something
 can't influence long run well something can't
 observe. describing policy actions terms something
 can't affect something can't see. That's got
 headache. Now, easy solution that: get inflation
 zero, keep there, won't worry it.
 cut short rates 25 basis points seen long-term nominal
 rates go 35 40 basis points.
 light going note,
 particularly regard policy option alternative A,
 incomprehensible somehow could cut short
 rates based forecast inflation, market
 doesn't know about, keep real interest rates general
 rising, let alone foster lower real rates. similar
 example giving response Larry's question.
 Greenbook inflation forecast supported forecasts

 many surveys longer-term expectations. Real rates,
 suggested remarks, helpful thing look longer
 periods time, don't know make analysis
 short-run policy option based would happen real rates,
 particularly real rates across yield curve.
 MR. KOHN. don't think help headache. [Laughter]
 try explain thinking about. think
 Federal Reserve affect real rates changing federal funds
 rate, real nominal, since two
 inflation expectations don't change near term. think
 expectations Fed interest rates
 effect real rates, least intermediate part
 term structure. believe that's primary channel Federal
 Reserve policy economy. 1979, 1980, 1981 institution
 raised real rates very, high levels major effect
 economic activity. real rates rose short- long-term
 maturities order put slack economy reduce inflation.
 So, think Federal Reserve affect real rates, least
 business cycle. agree long run productivity thrift
 determine long-run real interest rate. premise meeting
 making policy changes short run affect
 real rates lean business cycles.
 Perhaps don't
 perfect job time, think evidence last 15
 years shows done pretty good job least
 occasions smoothing cycles changing real rates.
 regard alternative A, believe
 lower nominal funds rate, would effect real
 interest rates least intermediate-maturity spectrum.
 People would change idea Committee going

 question one debated amongst writing
 particular paragraph. is, policy credible,
 people thought lowering interest rates would simply provoke
 inflation, nominal intermediate- long-term rates might

 might even rise. view end FOMC lot
 credibility Committee lowered rates particular
 said lowered rates optimistic view
 inflation, would carry weight market least
 while. remember paragraph, would
 incoming data failed confirm Committee's expectations
 rates would back up. agree it's entirely guess
 inflation expectations come that.
 MR. MELZER. thought particularly difficult
 context recent experience make argument. Let
 leave there.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, question
 right longer-term rate spectrum, hypothetically

 squeezed reserves system, two things would happen:
 nominal rate would go inflation rate would go down,
 real rate would go up. think true
 longer run, can't affect it.
 
 -34-
 
 8/22/95
 
 MR. MELZER. It's true longer run. get troubled
 start extending yield curve making judgments

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think true long run,
 true long-term forecast real funds rate,
 may put way. short-term forecast real

 MR. MELZER. terms funds rate, yes. troubles

 MR. BLINDER. Don, want ask question came

 looked back, somewhat puzzling

 MR. KOHN. Yes, two differences. One
