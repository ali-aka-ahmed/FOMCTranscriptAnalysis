 items were, course, discussed
 great length recent meetings telephone conferences,
 
 -4-
 
 3/28/95
 
 curious whether anyone anything add rather
 exhaustive discussions had.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, time say
 something warehousing views that?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. comments could make
 briefly. Ted Truman sent lot background materials
 regarding warehousing reread reread
 memorandum Virgil colleagues earlier. think
 memo makes clear legal standpoint Fed definitely
 authority--or certainly make strong case
 Fed authority--to warehouse foreign exchange
 Treasury, understand that. however defensible
 operations may legal perspective, don't think
 case compelling look issue somewhat broader
 context takes account Fed's role government
 generally independence supposed have. see it,
 warehousing essentially fiscal policy action least fully
 equivalent effect fiscal policy action. mean
 end warehousing operation exactly final
 effect Congress authorized Treasury ESF purchase
 foreign exchange fund purchase issuing additional debt
 market. difference transaction done via
 warehousing usual Congressional appropriations process
 circumvented, purchase show budget.
 really worry risk taking longer term
 practice.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 mean market risk?
 
 MR. BROADDUS. No, mean risk institutional
 position Federal Reserve. really issue trying
 focus on, Mr. Chairman. think get sense
 public's reaction Mexican support package. don't want
 go detail. think it's example
 relevant here. know, use public funds assist
 foreign governments, however sensible may particular
 instances, highly charged political issue, especially
 people see good alternative uses funds home.
 Congressional leadership apparently supported package
 instance, don't believe Congress would voted authorize
 funds. think broad segment general public, rightly
 wrongly, opposes assisting Mexico generously. point
 risk see things go badly Mexico going
 forward, could become issue election next year.
 event, role would become widely understood,
 quite possible people could begin raise questions
 independence. could come much careful scrutiny.
 would sum issue briefly way:
 Congress placed
 Fed outside regular appropriations process protect
 independence. perceived abusing sort off-budget
 status, run serious risks longer run. Now,
 recognize practical difficulty trying pull back immediately
 operations. would hope you, Mr. Chairman,
 
 3/28/95
 
 Committee would least consider conveying concerns
 forcefully Treasury work hopefully reach
 accord whereby could withdraw operations
 period time, maybe defined target date. Again, recognize
 clear legal basis operations,
 think broader argument really quite
 persuasive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One reasons
 careful indicate Congress indeed
 warehousing facility respect Mexican deal precisely
 put front. Now, members Congress may
 understood it, must tell got negative responses,
 types questions asking suggested
 least asking questions idea nature
 whole operation. issue deal Treasury
 government, fiscal agent involve various
 types support Treasury one sense impinge
 independence institution. trouble, unfortunately,
 fully independent one
 government element trying draw line.
 think somewhat uncomfortable warehousing
 facility. think uncomfortable greater lesser
 extent swap line facility, discussions
 Treasury regarding issues basically
 lesser greater extent somewhat opposition initiatives
 Treasury. also recognize, think indicated
 number months ago, central bank broad
 responsibilities ensure safety soundness financial
 system. could move back narrow central bank
 mode, would agree respect would
 less risk us. sure whether would giving
 country something value. think take risks,
 certainly issues raise valid ones. don't think
 great disagreement need careful
 issues. think careful hope continue
 be.
 MR. BROADDUS. appreciate sorry keep
 raising issues. think short-term risk;
 it's sort thing likely hit us face
 immediately. worry time really would like
 compromise position institution government,
 looking argument, think strongest
 argument would find.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 monetary policy.
 MR. BROADDUS.
 
 strongest argument
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Mr. Chairman, make technical point
 warehousing issue:
 don't want comment political
 aspects it; role. technical matter
 Treasury could conduct warehousing transactions market
 another financial institution. notion warehousing
 technical matter evasion fiscal authority Congress
 think correct. talking perceptions.
 
 3/28/95
 
 worked hard changed warehousing arrangement
 clearly arms-length, market-related transaction.
 exactly terms Treasury could divided
 150 institutions market.
 accommodate Treasury convenience them.
 raise questions role role assisting Mexico
 kinds things, perfectly well acknowledge.
 technical matter, transaction could done market.
 Therefore, don't think it's fair say evasion
 fiscal authority Congress.
 MR. BROADDUS. it's done us, though, basically
 show budget, right?
 MR. TRUMAN. wouldn't show budget either way.
 Treasury swap DM yen us.
 sell us spot buy back forward.
 exactly terms Citibank Chase Deutsche Bank
 Bank Tokyo, whatever institution might be. would
 exactly impact fiscally.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. fiscal effect occurs ESF
 funds created. moment ESF big set assets
 big set liabilities. Nobody talking expanding size
 ESF increasing capital appropriations.
 talking refinancing assets different basis
 fiscal effects.
 MR. BROADDUS. feeling done
 private institutions market, ought see
 push Treasury that. Whatever convenience Treasury
 gaining us is, standpoint least, offset
 longer-term risk continuing operations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. legitimate question.
 view issue essentially Treasury requests us
 it, give request serious consideration.
 view may transaction technically feasible
 private market, inconvenience involved arranging relatively
 large sums raises questions efficiency
 operation. reasonable consideration
 confront. careful precisely get
 intertwined Treasury; crucial issue.
 recent years think widened gap increased wedge
 us Treasury, Ted mentioning. words,
 gone market relationship basically arms-length
 approach feasible effort make certain don't
 inadvertently get caught Treasury initiatives
 want us get involved in. time say "no."
 MR. BROADDUS. understand points. hope
 continue process widen gap little further.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. personally uncomfortable
 doing. uncomfortable thought might
 pick entire $20 billion warehousing, obviously
 remote contingency. President Jordan.
 
 3/28/95
 
 MR. JORDAN. things Ted sent ruined
 weekend well! read material before, one time
 another, always reread much
 can't remember it. satisfied technical
 standpoint legal standpoint really issue
 discussed lawyers always figure way
 whatever think good public policy do. So, question
 comes whether good public policy.
 current set institutional arrangements designed
 totally different era different purpose. ESF, swaps,
 warehousing--all that--were intended give us access
 liquidity. ESF designed dollar even
 dominant reserve currency. arrangements came
 Bretton Woods system. ESF
 capability warehousing something like swap lines
 dealing situation one surfaced
 December Mexico, institutional arrangements
 would designed address issues. today's world, given
 role dollar arrangements central banks,
 would establish set institutional arrangements provide
 liquidity countries Mexico or, future, Chile,
 Costa Rica, whomever. would set something resembling
 today.
 would like see happen Peter Fisher work
 Board staff think kind institutional
 arrangements would like 21st century produce
 kind report time issue comes next
 February. Fed speed don't know could get done
 February. private sector
 problem would give staff mandate get done three
 months now. Fed speed, could ask staff come
 back set proposals next February kind
 arrangements would provide international liquidity
 countries, especially less developed
 occasionally get mess. objective us
 carry central bank role without getting possibility
 people saying something consistent
 foreign policy objectives something subverting debt
 limit issue may come executive legislative
 branches government. 1979 1980, definitely don't want
 get ourselves, central bank, executive
 legislative branches playing political game
 something like debt ceiling. want nowhere sight
 something like happens again. Warehousing leaves us open
 position getting caught something don't intend
 do. So, would like see whole issue rethought.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. question really whether
 role central function provide dollar liquidity
 nations ongoing basis ad hoc basis. going
 raise argument international financial markets
 changed Bretton Woods structure,
 emergence private global finance substantial extent
 made much purposes Bretton Woods structure dubious
 merit current environment. reason raised questions
 earlier use swaps role modern world
 
 3/28/95
 
 --especially order magnitude swaps look
 context size types problems seem
 emerged EMS, Mexico like--seems anachronism.
 little concerned, however, setting study form
 suggested. expensive undertaking. think
 might bad idea, however, couple memoranda
 discuss broader questions without getting
 initiatives suggesting. proposal strikes
 much larger project use resources think prepared
 get involved get clearer focus view
 issue. important question think raising, Jerry,
 much post Bretton Woods structure Federal Reserve
 anachronism role today's environment. would
 much prefer short memoranda spend lot
 time trying think type structure go
 here. So, unless someone objection that, request Ted
 see whether could short review history
 issue. would involve revisiting lot material
 put together, think central focus
 question difference emergence private global finance
 makes relative structure since evolved
 1960s.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Mr. Chairman?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. don't objection,
 issue discussed tables like around
 world, given happened Mexico, Argentina,
 countries. wondering rethinking going internationally
 regard sorts things play
 done.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. basis meetings
 least involved in--and colleagues
 similar meetings--I think general recognition size
 problem emerged Mexico size
 international facility perceived necessary address
 clearly rule generic facility. enough cash
 world handle problems without producing potentially large
 inflationary pressures use SDRs, IMF quota expansions,
 that.
 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 moral hazard extraordinary.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, including sure IMF
 would like, IMF become world bank lender last
 resort. last resort think anything.
 led us question whether possible
 bankruptcy statutes sovereign nations. know, moment
 exist question whether mechanism
 would make possible address types problems
 confronting Mexico restructuring mode equivalent
 bankruptcy facility rather providing liquidity,
 implicit swap relationships. discussion
 going forward BIS. Ted, assume talk
 Halifax Summit this?
 
 3/28/95
 
 -9-
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Mexico situation, better worse,
 clearly given Halifax Summit something focus on--something
 chit-chat stable exchange rates, may put
 way. something bankruptcy orderly workout area
 one ideas discussion. It's also fair
 say ideas discussion include Chairman
 tried pour cold water on--that vastly increasing size
 IMF capacity deal kinds situations.
 don't think consensus among various nations involved
 G-7 moment. appears options
 still table, though people think options
 taken off.
 MS. MINEHAN. would think whatever rethinking
 Federal Reserve's response view
 things take place context rest
 world thinking issues.
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, certainly big small issues
 involved types raised discussion.
 That's partly started Mexico, one hand
 country-specific type problem. hand, Mexico
 regarded symptomatic, Chairman said, nature
 international financial system functioning
 potential problems challenges move 21st century.
 It's difficult sort things out. far country-specific
 problems concerned, fair say many central
 banks major industrial countries fact involved
 process are. nature involvement
 different ours. might useful Committee, one
 little studies Chairman requested, us describe
 G-10 central banks regard dealing
 smaller--if may put way--problems. Indeed,
 cases efforts made help countries
 involved terms money, though U. S. Treasury
 often involved whereas central banks involved.
 example current effort put together bridge loan
 Argentina. find G-10 central banks backing BIS
 loan. case United States participation,
 goes forward, done exclusively Treasury.
 central banks turn supported treasuries one
 way another, sometimes formally always formally.
 cases central banks take degree risk loan
 another country far corner world; example Sweden
 relative Argentina. Federal Reserve chosen that.
 maybe would useful, least background note, try
 put together study describe countries do.
 doesn't touch big issues might help deal little
 ones.
 MS. MINEHAN. It's probably right think
 dot every "i" cross every "t" set process
 follow circumstances. you're suggesting would
 helpful, think, terms understanding better.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman, much
 involved anybody.
 
 -10-
 
 3/28/95
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes, Mr. Chairman. think
 basic issue exists even light changed
 international financial markets whether individual country
 responsible conduct, including paying price
 mistakes. debates difficult occasion
 Mexican situation normal allies
 questioned whether forgiving Mexico excessively policy
 errors. took view, know, Mexico unique,
 unusual, serious systemic risk involved.
 easiest case make Alan Blinder discovered
 January February BIS Sunday night dinners Mike Kelley
 March dinner. permanent feature
 Federal Reserve three meetings, got get head bloodied
 three!
 think one difficult questions moving toward
 elaborate discussions IMF becoming lender last resort,
 think terrible idea do, even whether
 modify significantly swap lines central bank
 relationships exist Bretton Woods era basic
 question: responsibility country, including
 own, manage affairs way market turn
 punish severely? main thing speed size
 capital flows changed punishment quick
 severe. It's different; it's faster
 deeper. great reluctance part leading central
 banks Europe Japan, think large us around
 table here, think shift world
 everybody misbehave world take care them.
 world doesn't riches resources make possible.
 think careful, including meetings like Halifax
 Summit, moving excessively unrealistically
 permissive direction.
 Federal Reserve, seems me, handling
 brilliantly difficult balancing act involved
 supportive U.S. policy Mexico, thought basically
 good idea least substance--I say compliment you,
 Mr. Chairman, it--without getting
 confused translated something much
 broadly applicable. policy consider Mexican case
 unique, difficult us next
 deserving case view many people Argentina. One could
 argue Argentines better policy
 taking much aggressive actions fix themselves. therefore
 tough us say thought Mexico needed support,
 including support Federal Reserve, think
 Argentina needed support. think single best argument
 Mexico unique. isn't, it's unusual,
 God knows decide line gets established.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. discussion,
 would like combine three foreign policy instruments move
 simultaneously. Would somebody like make motion?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Let's move
 finally regular agenda call Peter Fisher.
 MR. FISHER.
 Appendix.]
 
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 [Statement--see
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Peter either
 domestic foreign side?
 MR. JORDAN. Peter, there's press commentary
 effect dollar's role dominant international reserve
 currency wane, following pound sterling's
 earlier slide. Yet facts are, reported, central
 banks around world substantially increased holdings
 dollars reduced holdings deutschemarks
 currencies. outside commentaries would suggest central
 banks around world holding lot dollar reserves
 really want. perception?
 MR. FISHER. think number central banks holding
 dollar reserves people within central banks think
 ought holding. wouldn't pretend say
 official posture central banks, think leakage
 markets occurs result that. number
 central banks Asia accumulated large dollar reserves
 rather active approach foreign exchange trading
 potential source central bank profit. central banks,
 people may view would rather hold fewer dollars,
 since banks' foreign exchange desks tend somewhat active,
 market free interpret move one way
 must secular trend. frequently trading back
 forth, sort activity certainly provided credence
 general story.
 MR. JORDAN. One final question:
 particular, know
 Bundesbank Bank Japan feel exchange
 translation eroding dollar assets?
 MR. FISHER. talk time time that.
 happy it, Bundesbank fully committed
 single reserve currency--the dollar. appetite
 diversifying portfolio. think Bank Japan policy
 level still less committed dollar reserve policy.
 diversified somewhat holding marks. It's
 still tiny, tiny fraction total reserves.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. question either Peter Ted.
 terms causes weakness dollar, referred
 change expectations future U.S. fiscal deficits. One way
 look effect deficits monetary policy
 inflation objective, impact greater deficits increase
 real rate interest. often would lead higher value
 dollar. fact, many macro models
 type linkage. get lower value dollar, think
 
 -12-
 
 3/28/95
 
 assumption debt would monetized.
 question is, two types influences dollar,
 roles think play longer term role
 played recent period?
 MR. FISHER. I'll take short term leave Ted
 long term! short term, think fiscal picture weighs
 dollar mentioned principally terms competence issue
 relates U.S. economic management, sense
 forecasting macro economic effect. Whether analytically correct
 not, market participants sense add two deficits,
 current account deficit fiscal deficit, say can't
 manage anything can't find reason buy dollars hold
 dollars. short run, least last three months, don't
 think markets really tried digest implications,
 have, much sophisticated basis. negative
 short run. Now, I'll defer Ted tougher question.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, tougher question, think
 absolutely right result standard macro models
 give you: cut fiscal deficit produce lower interest
 rates turn translate reducing external
 deficit lower interest rates lower currency. One way
 square notion dollar appreciate
 fiscal deficit cut, distinguish real nominal.
 extent fear central bank
 seek point monetize deficit float away
 inflation, country could stronger nominal currency
 time weaker real currency.
 MR. PARRY. guess point want make keys
 monetary policy-MR. TRUMAN. one argument
 support literature. longer-term argument
 would run lower deficit investment, competitive
 currency, therefore appreciation dollar.
 long-run argument. slightly different argument timing
 feature:
 fiscal deficit cut, start bring
 current account deficit sooner otherwise less
 depreciation needed long run otherwise.
 sort "compared what" argument. terms long run, much
 argument turn factors Peter talking
 about--the notion fiscal situation played dollar
 terms whether we, United States, manage affairs
 appropriately. probably exacerbated
 psychological realm Mexican situation. two situations
 played deep reading
 macroeconomics involved.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. want make comment Bob Parry's point
 pose question. Bob's point answers it, isn't
 relevant last three months, six months, nine months,
 twelve months--pick timeframe; almost doesn't matter--surveys
 inflationary expectations United States shown
 deterioration long bonds trading lower interest rates,
 
 -13-
 
 3/28/95
 
 higher interest rates? two things would seem largely
 persuasive--although none definitive regard
 state long-term inflationary expectations absent index bond,
 us Federal Reserve rooting
 long time. best information have,
 seems speaks one voice extent
 market expects Federal Reserve monetize deficits. think--I
 guess opposite "ahistorical" "historical"--that also
 historical observation Federal Reserve
 monetizing deficits. Whether one rational adaptive
 expectations, think sensible presume Federal
 Reserve going monetize deficits. don't believe
 markets believe Federal Reserve going monetize them.
 either disagree that, Ted Peter?
 MR. FISHER.
 
 No.
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No.
 
 wish thought it.
 
 MR. BLINDER. question going pose:
 Peter,
 thought said--correct misheard reading
 --that short end led interest rates since last FOMC
 meeting. say that?
 MR. FISHER.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 sense short end-I reading Greenbook table--
 
 MR. PRELL. think Peter referring shorter
 intermediate term, 1- 3-year area.
 MR. FISHER. sorry clear.
 referring 2-year maturity coupon curve.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Okay.
 
 Fine.
 

 
 question case.
 
 MS. MINEHAN. Peter, mentioned dealers

 MS. MINEHAN.
 
 It's big enough affect Treasury

 MR. FISHER. So, stories nature

 MR. TRUMAN. important Brady bonds.

 Regarding differences Greenbook forecast,

 MR. LINDSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like colleague,

 MR. BLINDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, quite brief.
 scenario sketched Greenbook looks reasonable

 reasonably close balanced. think one is, would

 why. could list 12 upside 15 downside risks, I'll list

 [Laughter] side, would mention net

 false negative several times. remember,
 prominently, developments last summer economy started emit

 much less likely false negative

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't repeat that; want get

 [Laughter]
 MR. BLINDER. want get signs? think

 role FOMC meeting keep echoing Bob Parry said.
 agree much Bob's analysis. look pieces
 Greenbook forecast, easier tell stories component-bycomponent--consumer spending, business fixed investment, inventories,
 etc.--coming lower rather higher. these, think would
 put inventories top list. hunches,
 all, major bone pick Greenbook
 details.
 Much important fact--and really
 fact--that forecasts tend understate swings whenever occur.
 doesn't matter direction; it. Forecast revisions
 serially correlated; statistical fact. several
 reasons that. think underestimation

 really internalizing thinking--at least
 reasonably numerical way. tendency look

 look way all. data really say

 People understate swings, forget lags, underestimate

 soft landings.

 Let's move Kohn.
 
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. first sentence

 coffee between! [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don, revisited periodically
 issue going back form credit variable target replace

 MR. KOHN.
 
 credit variable borrowing?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Either. use word credit
 generic sense could money, could borrowing,
 could credit variable, could non-interest-rate variable.
 envisage sort target even remotely realistic
 going forecast saddled--I use word
 advisedly--with federal funds rate, think everyone would
 agree less desirable target something directly related
 central bank operations?
 MR. KOHN. really two issues, Mr. Chairman,
 would like subdivide response accordingly. One issue
 Peter Fisher looking every day adding
 subtracting reserves. used borrowing objective
 really proxy going money markets.
 little flexibility direct funds targeting. Now, Peter
 really keyed funds rate. Committee's target
 6 percent must react every time 5-15/16--although
 quite true. think going back targeting borrowing

 New York Fed. noted Bluebook last several

 MR. PARRY. Don, discussion symmetry

 discussion symmetry, talked Committee maybe
 concluding risks roughly balanced. assume
 primarily means risks terms economic growth. think
 Committee would communicating terms views
 inflation favor symmetric directive?
 MR. KOHN. Obviously, would depend Committee's
 outlook inflation. Committee concerned inflation
 likely rise fall wanted resist
 rise, asymmetry would tend convey that. Committee felt
 risks inflation evenly balanced around 3-1/4 percent
 core CPI projected Greenbook like outcome,
 seems Committee also would want tilt little bit
 toward tight side.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Don, discussion inertia
 might might work, mention monetary base.
 principally currency component, especially
 currency held abroad, something else mind?
 MR. KOHN. No. think first growth
 foreign holdings currency distorted growth base
 substantially. roughest notion proportion
 currency held overseas changes month month.
 lot work going Board trying estimate that,
 people refining estimates using sorts
 sophisticated econometric techniques--comparing seasonals things
 like that. end, still part way toward knowing

 point would make even ignoring
 currency part, reserves part base tracks Ml;
 is. velocity M1 extremely variable seen.
 Committee abandoned M1 targeting back early 1980s
 M1 became interest elastic accounts

 So, would put lot weight movements base.

 pretty obvious growth economy moving

 Gary Stern raised interesting question respect
 inventories. always case business people
 comment "my sales done well expected,"
 algebraically equivalent "my inventories higher

 important enough raise possibility second

 Greenbook may track here. probably mini inventory

 particular cause concern. indicated last meeting,
 don't think measures inventory levels pointing large

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, considering asymmetric

 fear bubble mentioned table. actually
 pretty good bubble develop bond market, paid fairly
 significant price financial market instability later.
 noted, bubble gave extra impetus demand late 1993
 early 1994. did, though, go asymmetric
 back off. conclude that, anything, cemented
 market's view stuck particular rate.
 built market's confidence could borrow 3 percent
 lend 6 percent, literally doing. I'll
 happy vote whatever Committee majority favors.
 fear bubble, view go asymmetric unless
 really expect raise rates. people want raise rates
 want send signal might so, think
 dissents would much appropriate way sending signal.
 Given 1993, going asymmetric backing off,
 afraid would strengthen conviction market maybe
 actually exacerbate bubble. favor symmetric.
