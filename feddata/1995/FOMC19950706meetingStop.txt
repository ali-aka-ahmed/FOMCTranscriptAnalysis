 MR. FISHER.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Peter?
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. two, Peter. First, could
 quickly repeat part Mexican transaction?
 MR. FISHER. value today, Mexicans drawing

 MR. LINDSEY. Second question: seems decline

 particularly redemptions hedge funds others.
 think implications efficacy intervention
 road? private sector fewer poker chips, might actually
 see intervention become successful?
 MR. FISHER. That's important difficult question.
 would put emphasis slightly differently you. think

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Peter, want follow said
 Mexico, something went awfully fast there.
 said Treasury monetized SDRs fund Mexican drawing.

 MR. FISHER. One resources ESF SDRs.

 process monetizing presenting us--let say
 explaining something wrong, Sandy, please bail out--we take
 get dollars them. major-MR. TRUMAN.
 
 sell us SDR certificates.
 
 MR. FISHER. sell us SDR certificates; get
 dollars SDR certificates. injection
 liquidity worry sterilize would
 form intervention sense. So, that's process
 providing dollars:
 monetizing SDRs.
 MR. JORDAN. we, twelve Federal Reserve Banks,

 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Right.

 MR. JORDAN.

 MR. KOHN. It's published weekly H.4.1 statement;
 don't know whether separate internal notification.
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 already $8 billion special drawing rights outstanding
 addition $11 billion gold stock.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think President Jordan asking
 whether somebody going call say "You become
 proud possessor increased amount SDR certificates."

 asking:
 "What's bank's liability side?"
 MR. FISHER.
 
 Initially, would--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Unless New York Bank holding
 increase offset deposits Fed wholly New
 York-MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Treasury balance goes up.
 
 MR. FISHER. mathmatical way Treasury balance
 goes up, saying. That's narrow answer.
 Chairman asking-MR. KOHN. sell government securities,
 draw balance.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's question asking.
 liquification wholly issue Federal Reserve Bank
 New York taking onto books SDR certificate crediting
 Treasury account $2 billion, transaction complete
 Cleveland Bank goes merry way nothing happens.
 think question is: certificates going show
 throughout System transactions liability
 side whom--the New York Bank, Treasury, what?
 MR. KOHN. current SDRs distributed throughout
 System way every asset is.
 MR. FISHER.
 System Open Market--
 
 may missing point, terms
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 liquification-MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No, point
 
 What's liability side?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Treasury takes SDR certificate,
 gives Federal Reserve, simultaneously places SDR
 certificate asset side consolidated balance sheet
 increases Treasury deposit liability side. That's
 happens consolidated system. President Jordan asking
 happens among Federal Reserve institutions? going
 allocate SDR certificates various Banks, appears
 liability side? creating deposit Treasury

 point, Mr. Chairman,
 deposit never shows up. Treasury knows advance

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Actually, related question.
 curious thing Jerry raised. end

 hold that, effect, nonearning asset?
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 It's nonearning.
 
 MR. JORDAN. reduce earnings. you're clarifying
 this, another question is:
 repurchase agreement, right?
 It's outright.
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No.
 
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 It's outright purchase.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Like gold certificates, it's outright

 MR. JORDAN. differs understanding, then,
 February March whenever, understanding

 would warehousing.
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 That's warehousing.
 
 MR. JORDAN. saying warehousing,
 repurchase agreement? So, permanent.
 MR. MCDONOUGH.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Correct.
 
 Permanent, yes.
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 MR. MCDONOUGH.
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 It's acquisition asset, swap.
 
 didn't know that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 President Moskow.
 
 questions Peter?
 
 MR. MOSKOW.
 
 another subject.
 
 MR. FISHER.
 
 want thank you!
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Peter, "morning call" morning
 one subjects fed funds futures rate.
 recollection morning fed funds futures rate
 indicating 60 65 percent probability 25 basis point cut
 fed funds rate month. wondering ties
 saying morning.
 MR. FISHER. think heard thing
 sources different times morning. Looking pricing
 contract different time horizons one adjust for,
 60ish percent probability, read literally,
 move early month--meaning now. implied
 probability closer 100 percent 25 basis point easing
 end month. Without going far gymnastics it,
 that's one interprets 14 basis points contract settles
 near end month, given different probabilities
 different time horizons.
 MR. MOSKOW. thought heard saying
 majority opinion market would
 move.
 MR. FISHER. Yes.
 trying offer note caution
 whether read price literally saying
 everyone market agreed probabilities
 attached move whether it's clearing price
 much higher sense confidence move
 earlier month others don't think move
 month all. room sorts interpretations
 whether given basis point implication fed funds contract
 indicates consensus view range different views find
 clearing price.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Peter?

 not, would somebody like move ratify foreign currency

 SPEAKER(?).

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Similarly, would
 somebody like move ratify domestic open market operations?
 MR. MCDONOUGH.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. let's move Chart Show

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank much.
 interesting around-the-world evaluation. Questions
 colleagues?
 MR. BROADDUS. Tom, could briefly describe model

 I'm sure

 MR. SIMPSON. exercise using quarterly

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. want follow chart, Tom.
 I'm reading right, says bond market, looking
 forward, feels lower future debt going lead lower future

 Yes, right.
 
 MR. BLINDER. means rates instruments

 MR. SIMPSON. No. might also point

 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. SIMPSON. you're right. model, longerterm rates relate housing capital spending driving

 much effect spending model.
 MR. BLINDER. follow expected future deficit

 MR. SIMPSON.
 
 That's eyes model.
 
 MR. BLINDER. Yes, absolutely, that's right.
 question Karen. G-7 economies--or rather
 G-6, leaving United States--the forecast growth
 near term accelerate various amounts recently
 been. Presumably, cases except Japan--and, heaven
 knows, maybe even Japan--there fiscal consolidation
 next two years. mentioned cases.
 imply monetary policy interest rates countries?
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 MS. JOHNSON. actually explicit interest rate paths
 built say countries. guess would
 invert question bit.
 deal Europe first
 return Canada. countries that, perceive it,
 exhibiting considerable momentum around end last year even
 early year. So, questions ask are:

 slowed economies first half 1995
 persist?
 policy action needed stimulate economies?
 cases may be, think answer get
 countries "no."
 example, Germany impact
 tax surcharge, reasons can't fully explain
 seem anticipated, visible earlier data.
 tax surcharge went effect early 1995, one
 see data; expect see reversed early 1996
 taxes reduced. effect exchange rate
 appreciation certainly piece story Germany maybe
 even France, flip sides Italy
 United Kingdom. got GDP Italy morning, example,
 strong first quarter. So, guess left
 way describing forecast say piece
 policy story tightening thought would come line
 early 1995 postponed. that, sense, monetary
 easing relative baseline starting.
 least several factors see explaining slowdown
 first half 1995 view transitory characteristics.
 either already built in, case German taxes,
 seen persistent enough require real policy
 response.
 Canada quite different. drop Canada far
 stronger think rationalize terms.

 related part U.S. economy, certainly
 amplitude far greater experienced United States.
 suspect need monetary policy easing
 Canada recovery really take hold again. seen actions
 Bank Canada already, think monetary easing
 fact forthcoming.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, question, specifically
 something came Chart Show paragraph
 jumped Bluebook, thought might want
 comment it. reference change NAIRU;
 5.9 percent terms analysis. recollection
 thick study done several years ago came
 number 6.1 percent. Would explain elements changed
 produce this? Obviously, longer term, policy
 significance. Secondly, footnote indicating
 adjustments demographics. think Kansas City found
 interesting talk publicly demographics estimates!
 clearly relevant terms estimating NAIRU
 likely future. going get another thick study
 little detail change made?
 MR. PRELL. guess would fair request point
 us another thick study.
 
 -10-
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 thin one would even better!
 
 [Laughter]
 
 MR. PRELL. One problems comparing past studies
 change current population survey.
 Even point degree uncertainty
 translate today's unemployment rate pre-1994 terms.
 So,
 one ingredient comparison old NAIRUs new NAIRUs.
 gone along, adjust sights
 also trying incorporate experience past
 year half respect wages prices trying surmise
 whether might high low. inched
 bit working assumption NAIRU is--the number around
 price forecast, effect, pivots. point
 talking 5.9 percent; little lower previously.
 allusion demographic adjustments Bluebook merely
 recognize that, look next five years,

 presentation, though, thought adjustments would greatly

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. couple questions. I'm sure
 whether first one Mike Tom. Going back Chart 8
 real interest rates fiscal scenarios comparing
 statement Greenbook, I'd like little
 elaboration. make references call fiscal restraint.
 understand supposed mean. describe
 Greenbook, fiscal restraint effect lowering equilibrium
 real rate . Normally, people would think lower interest
 rates, real nominal, mean easier monetary policy. So, tighter
 fiscal policy causes easier monetary policy.
 MR. PRELL.
 MR.
 JORDAN.
 
 Let interrupt there.
 Okay.
 
 MR. PRELL. wanted make clear could--and
 guess w failed--or maybe clearly could
 wasn't clear enough! didn't mean adjustment
 nominal rate, took reflection change
 natural r :e, viewed monetary stimulus. effect, keeps
 things neutral fiscal restraint tends lower natural
 rate--the rate would prevail economy steady
 state, operating potential. apologize confused
 score. fact, recognizing something
 think raised last meeting high real shortterm rate expected longer run whether
 felt 3 percent, wherever real rate is, sustainable
 rate. noted looked several years would
 
 -11-
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 become relevant consideration. said felt higher
 longer-run equilibrium natural rate prior
 Bluebook simulations introduced downward tilt. Since
 going bit Bluebook simulations
 building somewhat substantial fiscal consolidation, felt
 would appropriate us introduce
 forecast. So, that's interpreted.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay, absolutely problems
 that. still little problem references bond
 bond market rallies
 markets adaptive. It's like saying:
 enough, don't lower funds rate, gives
 little problem. let hold second. Greenbook
 says:
 "We introduced downward tilt funds rate.
 decline rates, though, interpreted implying
 impetus aggregate demand," meaning downward movement
 would equilibrate. read statement say also
 natural Wicksellian rate equilibrium real rate moved
 down, failure move nominal rate would de facto
 restrictive policy stance.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Assuming inflation expectations remain constant.
 
 MR. JORDAN. So, whatever causes equilibrium rate move
 down--fiscal policy, God, something--you would say, even though
 headlines may say lower nominal rate easing, failure
 lower nominal rate fact restrictive.
 MR. PRELL.
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 That's right.
 Okay.
 
 MR. PRELL.
 emphasize that, given limited
 ability predict relationships, calibration
 clearly uncertain. think point Tom's presentation here,
 schematic one sense, simply large
 anticipatory reactions bond market, need
 move short rate aggressively order give greater
 stimulus private investment spending. It's simple point,
 don't want suggest precision charts
 calibrate neatly. Again, it's broad conceptual issue
 one that, obviously, would think folks would want contemplate
 thinking funds rates might time.
 MR. JORDAN. want draw conceptual aspect.

 problem last point rally bond
 market, that's translate supply demand
 that's
 reserves might terms quantities.
 different framework. Let hold one, though,
 don't want take much time want ask Karen
 help thinking something Japan. used
 word "deflation" know number Japanese commentators
 denied vigorously deflation. don't know
 mean that, word deflation abstract means
 purchasing power yen rising. I'm sure whether
 really people mind say things.

 go back beginning decade, commercial

 land Imperial Palace worth

 stocks listed Nikkei, aggregated, would exceeded

 true.

 think course decade going remove

 that, one two things happen. price
 things, converted equivalent currency,

 us asset prices goods prices move toward world levels.
 else could adjustment possibly made?
 MS. JOHNSON. mean suggest pejorative notion
 using word "deflation." meant literally
 rate change certain prices negative. Now, certainly
 true happening goods sector degree
 described happened. is, opened up--a little
 maybe--Japanese markets world trade. example, use
 Japanese national income account data real terms, share

 I'm sure
 see much explanation land prices
 falling still falling. see really
 explanation stock market behavior. So, asset price story,
 special factors side late 1980s--a
 speculative bubble kind story, fueled perhaps retrospect
 seems like easy monetary policy--has different story
 side well.
 particularly alarmed Japanese goods

 would think might easier concerned happened

 downward rigidity sorts problems created.
 merely suggesting environment Japanese monetary policy
 looks bit tight, given know capacity

 MR. JORDAN. didn't think pejorative

 MR. LINDSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. last

 distributed table members Committee. think
 table carries several messages. First, would refer
 comparison two columns labeled "1995 Enacted" "1996 602B
 Allocation."
 602B allocations given budget committees
 various appropriations committees, amount
 money divide actual spending. think first thing
 instructive basis comparison table

 baseline includes growth; cutting 1995 nominals.
 amount cut shy $22 billion. mandatory

 add 3 percent inflation factor, really

 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. think preparation
 meeting difficult tenure,
 seeing many conflicting economic signals. seem
 classic fork road--whether inventory

 air pocket approach soft landing. fair
 amount discussion today conflicting real economic data
 signals. talked auto sales, housing, inventory
 buildup, consumer sector--these areas signals
 mixed. real data signals mixed, would
 point monetary aggregates giving us even less
 consistent signals. current frenzy economic analysis
 spinning econometric forecasting models probably
 supported meager data date. struggling
 look inside models, questioning assumptions, questioning this,
 questioning that. However, narrow path
 adjustment likely fine, difficult models
 pick fine gradations.
 Well, bit frustrated process, like Bob

 us two quarters thereafter economy return

 inflation outlook, however, correspondingly improved. Although
 recent employment report wake-up call, think news
 since last meeting predominantly negative. Governor
 Blinder's prescient prediction last meeting Greenbook
 forecast second third quarters 1995 would
 written average 1/2 percentage point per quarter
 proven accurate, although he, too, underestimated downward
 revision. Even so, still consider Greenbook's forecast bit
 optimistic think bulk risk respect real
 activity side. even modest shortfall
 final demand growth, easy elaborate scenario
 inventory adjustment process protracted previously
 foreseen, longer-term outlook, inventory factors
 turned neutral, entails higher unemployment larger output gap
 Greenbook envisions. could easily end think
 extended growth recession.
 last meeting, somewhat sympathetic
 Greenbook's conclusion bond market rally might overdone,
 bit concerned upside risk interestsensitive sectors might rebound strongly. concern
 score faded. see bond stock market rallies
 functioning simply automatic stabilizers partially cushion
 downside risks. think impetus lower long-term interest rates
 wealth effects working way pipeline
 buoy spending housing related consumer durables later
 1995 1996. impetus needed avoid hard landing.
 longer-term bond yields back up, outcome
 anticipated Greenbook baseline fed funds assumption,
 downside risks would greater.
 Let briefly enumerate see major sources
 downside risk stage. mentioned
 discussion go-around. first concerns inventory
 investment, think could easily turn higher
 quarter Greenbook forecast $29 billion real terms.
 forecast guesswork since, Mike noted, lot crucial
 second-quarter data missing. inventory investment
 higher, adjustment remains ahead Greenbook
 contemplates. mentioned last time want reiterate
 important thinking. always
 downside risk inventory adjustment could trigger

 snowballing process cumulative decline multiplieraccelerator process negative feedbacks consumption

 disappointed line Gary Stern said happened firms
 parts District. firms see expectations
 growth investment plans based disappointed,

 concern last meeting credit terms may stop easing may
 even tighten process slow growth conceivably recession
 default rates, showing hints picking up,
 rise further.
 Another risk concerns consumption, sluggish
 quarter could easily rebound less strongly toward year-end
 Greenbook assumes, particularly backup long rates
 puts downward pressure stock market. Bluebook's
 simulations reveal higher saving rate poses serious risks
 forecast. 1/2 percentage point increase saving
 rate, simulations show unemployment rising 6.8 percent
 mid-1996.
 third risk many mentioned also concerns
 export growth, needed source strength

 comes one country spending less countries seeing

 then, course, fiscal policy since

 improved considerably.
 Now, offset sources weakness, Greenbook
 forecast relies strong rebound housing demand associated

 baseline fed funds assumption backup long

 Moreover, Bluebook baseline simulation makes apparent, Mike
 Prell reiterated this, 1996 tighter fiscal scenario alone

 level.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 MR. BLINDER. five points make. tell
 get point four you'll know almost
 finished.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't start five?
 
 [Laughter]
 
 MR. BLINDER. right, I'll start five.
 inflation. thought good place finish.
 last two FOMC meetings expressed two views-Governor Yellen scooped this.
 said thought
 Greenbook shade optimistic, said history tells us
 forecast errors serially correlated. say
 gloat, guilty anybody else.
 Greenbook times, also high times.

 little Greenbook. none cases
 discrepancy large, although time see
 distinction enough Greenbook outside
 FOMC range. rounding quarters, hope.
 not, stronger message there!
 [Laughter]
 add,
 however, since free rein forecasts regarding
 assume monetary policy, make Greenbook's
 assumption interest rates, rather embedded forecast
 assumption fed funds rate would 50 75 basis points
 lower year-end today, starting immediately.
 several reasons coming forecast
 Greenbook, going mention briefly
 someone around table mentioned now.
 one want emphasize unreasonable
 expectation fairly smooth inventory adjustment way
 Greenbook it, something scant
 evidence things working way far--that
 say, inventory accumulation coming substantially lower
 Q2 Q1.
 data scanty,
 Greenbook may fact turn right; don't rule out.
 think keep mind that, comes inventory
 adjustments, bigger come harder fall.
 Second,
 reasons many people mentioned probably guessed
 question raised earlier, think foreign GDP likely
 weaker forecast, exports commensurately
 weaker. Thirdly, worried consumer, really right
 way say worried multiplier-accelerator
 mechanisms severe embodied Greenbook.
 look list, figure one three downside risks
 bound materialize--I don't know one--which reason
 point estimate lower Greenbook's. So, take
 Greenbook subtract one three, get outside
 FOMC range.
 Now, important risk
 forecast. must almost 18th person--17th, Chairman hasn't
 spoken yet--to say risk looks lopsided
 side. says point estimate and, look
 think probability distribution around guess
 mode--don't ask come point estimate, think
 it's mode--the risks clearly side. mentioned
 risk inventory adjustment severe

 think
 Greenbook forecast, put high list.
 risk almost every component spending. consumption, already
 said serious concern that, lower employment
 real wages, falling income lead weaker consumer spending
 Greenbook. also risk, somebody said--it
 Bob Parry--that 1993 1994 unusually buoyant years
 household spending simply going repeat again.
 business fixed investment, holding remarkably
 well, worried accelerator taking hold GDP
 growth turns positive 5 percent Q4 negative.
 Greenbook forecast, falling capacity utilization weaker sales
 going bring falling profits, think companies
 really factored much thinking yet. Lower sales imply
 less need add capacity. hope business fixed investment
 hold response that, downside risk. Governor
 Lindsey mentioned downside risk fiscal side. little
 less anxious time previous FOMC
 meeting, don't rule all. already
 mentioned foreign demand risk. Frankly, none worries,
 look them, huge. going
 direction. odds dodge bullets
 strong.
 third point want make relevance
 latest tea leaves surface top cup,
 bit better news previous several months.
 think news last six eight days better news
 last six eight weeks. don't think get

 Similarly, mixed bag

 could think whole variety shocks,
 sitting close edge, take much. line
 that, examined--with help staff also

 New York Fed, thank--several statistical indicators

 whole bunch these, realized. learned

 would get naive thing. old rule says

 50 percent chance recession. leading
 indicators saying statistical indicators also
 saying. personal probability actually lower rather
 higher end range, like third 60 percent,
 enough risk leave uncomfortable.
 fifth last point, first
 point, inflation. Greenbook forecast,
 certainly weaker forecast, risk rising inflation
 looks minimal. Greenbook, unemployment rate

 historical average, leads conclude, exactly staff
 does, pressure rising inflation either gone right
 soon gone GDP gap changes sign positive
 negative, one signs way. particularly clear
 look long-run Bluebook projection, shows inflation
 falling ever slightly next several years. leads
 final point, echoing Mike Kelley said moments
 ago. inflation outlook turns right--and seems
 reasonable expectation--the peak rate inflation
 cycle, cycles well trends inflation,
 2-1/2 percentage points peak inflation rate last
 cycle. substantial progress. talking
 individual inflation forecasts differ little. People
 said forecasts higher lower Greenbook
 forecast .2 percentage point so. Nobody forecast inflation
 accurately; nobody earth. So, likely reduction 2-1/2
 percentage points last cyclical peak significant
 progress. suggests, furthermore, one cycle, hopefully
 starting imminently side, going bring inflation
 almost zero. Thank you.

 Questions Don?
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Don, evidence--I think
 earlier--that velocity M2 back closer zero.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 trend velocity growth?
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Yes.
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 MR. KOHN. whole level M2 velocity shifted by,
 think, 15 percent; M2 15 percent lower would
 thought using old standards. evidence
 growth rate relationships among M2, nominal income, opportunity
 costs come back roughly track last two years so.

 case confidence would persist,
 might able imagine situation growth rate M2
 demand back track velocity would fluctuate around
 current level rather around lower old level.

 distinct possibility, point trying make
 briefing that, given uncertainty relationships,
 think little early pronounce M2 velocity back track.
 MR. LINDSEY.

 MR. KOHN. Approximately, yes. Now, M2
 growth second quarter--by several percentage points--than
 model predicting. growth rate terms, model right
 1994. think happened second quarter year
 M2 reacting decline intermediate- long-term
 rates, whereas model uses bill rate proxy alternative
 investments.
 So, didn't capture declines. Going forward,
 whether old standard model--it nearly ten years old--will
 capture dynamics depend part, think, whether shortand long-term rates move together traditional cyclical
 relationship.
 MR. LINDSEY. phrase question,
 really statement:
 fact back stable

 low?
 MR. KOHN. would give midpoint 3 percent.
 Committee looked providing sort benchmark
 might expect M2 reasonable price stability
 reached.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 That's year 2000!
 
 MR. KOHN. next year models actually see growth
 upper end range--perhaps consistent
 saying--in 4 5 percent area, approximately.
 MR. PRELL. Let remind ran models
 nominal GDP forecast, pretty low number,
 would want make mental adjustment forecasts.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Don, applying logic described
 respect 1 5 percent range set M2,
 enough confidence M3--its stability time
 relationship M2--to say, historical relationships obtained,
 comparable range M3 would be?
 MR. KOHN. No, don't enough confidence. past,
 M3 growth tended run approximately percentage point
 M2, 2 6 percent range M3 would seem
 
 -39-
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 bad alignment. past experience applies period
 depositories capturing increasing share credit extensions.
 best guess share credit flows would remain
 constant, perhaps M3 range ought equal
 M2 range, assuming depositories rely retail wholesale
 deposits roughly proportions. So, hard know.
 really depends role depositories play financial
 system. repeat earlier point, M3 range 2 6 percent
 roughly consistent range 1 5 percent M2 terms

 forward much harder question.
 MS. YELLEN. setting M2 ranges, normally look
 consistency target range Committee's
 nominal GDP projections? nominal GDP projections
 1996. full range 4-1/2 6 percent central tendency
 4-3/4 5-1/2 percent; asked prepare individual
 forecasts assumption desirable monetary policy. So,
 take nominal GDP forecasts assume M2 velocity
 constant, wouldn't suggest 5 percent M2 growth would
 consistent forecasts providing public
 Congress? shouldn't 5 percent midpoint M2 range?
 not--and even alternative II 1996--it
 seems adopting alternative II range, certainly
 alternative range, communicates lower real growth target
 nominal GDP forecasts imply. growth rate 5 percent M2
 probably consistent with, say, 1-1/2 2 percent real GDP growth.
 M2 target taken middle range, 1 5 percent M2
 range implies lower target real growth that.
 Even
 alternative II, midpoint M2 range 4 percent
 could entail perhaps 1 1-1/2 percent real GDP growth 1996.
 MR. KOHN. think right, Governor Yellen,
 number years Committee really taking
 aggregates seriously guides policy, result
 moving ranges around make consistent
 outlook. Part problem hard ex ante know
 ranges ought be. may little
 confidence that, even relative staff's nominal GDP
 forecast, 4-1/2 percent 1996, 1 5 percent range
 M2 obviously low. took Committee's nominal GDP,
 higher staff forecast--and especially assumed
 interest rates would lower get nominal GDP--we
 might decline velocity. is, might need even M2
 run exercise, would
 market rates went down.
 guess would talking M2 projection 5 percent
 even little 5 percent entirely consistent
 Committee's nominal GDP forecast. way work this,

 trouble sorting distinction downward funds rate

 MR. KOHN. demand shock built baseline,
 fiscal restraint needed balance budget year
 2002. already there, would add fiscal
 restraint top unless thought even greater fiscal
 restraint would forthcoming. One could also imagine situation
 path fiscal policy little front-loaded
 staff assuming therefore restraint happens sooner rather
 later. Mike noted yesterday, assumptions 1995
 1996 fiscal policy lie somewhere President
 Republicans. So, thought situation
 Republicans somehow prevailed stance fiscal policy,
 also would demand shock--at least next years.
 MS. MINEHAN.

 MR. KOHN. used saving rate shock,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Blinder.
 
 MR. BLINDER. want ask brief question

 M2 demand function works, interest rate assumed tacitly 3

 MR. KOHN.

 7/5-6/95
 
 MR. BLINDER. No, terms 1996. point made
 would like things longerterm horizon may one question, would like 1995
 1996 may another question. trying ask easier
 question--from end 1996.
 MR. KOHN. I'm sure easier! course, staff
 4-1/2 percent M2 growth projected 1996 interest rates
 Greenbook, means gentle decline interest rates
 toward middle 1996. used interest rates
 tighter scenario--that is, 75 basis point increase--that gets
 projection M2 3-1/2 percent.
 MR. BLINDER. question interest rates would
 need make midpoint? staff M2 growth 4-1/2 percent

 baseline 5-1/2 percent easier alternative.
 pointed out, funny numbers aiming 3
 percent.
 MR. KOHN. would require slightly tightening
 tighter forecast. tighter forecast M2 growth 3-1/2
 percent; make 3 percent would need slightly higher interest
 rates, perhaps avoiding drop interest rates second half
 1996 might raise rates bit keep up.
 think tighter scenario gives baseline think that.
 MR. BLINDER.
 
 Thank you.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree would

 light possibility, postulated, might ease
 monetary policy. would spend hour half HumphreyHawkins testimony explaining changes something don't
 take seriously. risk body politic thinking, thanks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. certainly agree recommendation
 regarding M2, Mr. Chairman. respect aggregates,
 would favor alternative II 1995 alternative 1996.
 said that, let make couple additional comments,
 indulge me.
 think, discussion showing,
 acknowledge monetary targets longer serve much
 original purpose, least foreseeable future.
 Among things, purpose underline System's
 commitment price stability serve nominal anchor
 monetary policy. think many interested parties outside Federal
 Reserve, including key Congressmen, well aware that.
 course, Humphrey-Hawkins law requires us set monetary targets,
 continue foreseeable future
 comply law. However, current short-term policy situation
 gives us unusual opportunity argue changes
 Humphrey-Hawkins law may put us position develop
 effective meaningful longer-term strategy monetary
 policy.
 Let clarify mean opportunity. everybody
 knows, recent fairly sustained deceleration economic growth
 lot people calling Fed ease policy. case
 certainly made today. going one
 make it, sure someone will; anything
 today, case become even stronger go forward
 sluggishness persists. think fair say, though, many
 us would concerned reducing funds rate target, even
 circumstances, could seriously damage credibility
 longer-term oft-stated commitment price stability,
 stage policy firm longer-term nominal anchor.
 Consequently, within short period time--it probably would
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 -44-
 
 happen immediately--if performance economy play
 exactly anticipate, drop funds rate could produce
 another inflation scare.
 happened, long-term interest rates
 would shoot greatly complicate policy going forward.
 So, see it, dilemma. way
 dilemma view Committee develop new
 meaningful longer-term nominal anchor monetary policy would
 tie longer-term inflation expectations really make
 commitment price stability credible now.
 would free us take flexibly short-term policy actions
 need take. Monetary aggregates may played anchoring
 role past, clearly can't now.
 background, Mr. Chairman, would respectfully urge try
 point dilemma testimony.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think raised
 interesting points. May ask, going use
 monetary aggregates, give us 20 seconds
 would propose?
 MR. BROADDUS. going lay strategy briefly
 could. key point want make current situation
 gives us opportunity recommend something terms
 fairly concrete rather abstract. view,
 develop operationally meaningful longer-term monetary policy
 strategy. would three components. First, said
 February Janet little exchange, commit
 publicly firmly price stability objective put
 forward Neal amendment--both definition price stability,
 whose language think negotiated time, also
 importantly 5-year longer-term horizon. specific time
 horizon think would make meaningful.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. talking statute
 unilateral action Federal Reserve?
 MR. BROADDUS. would preferable statute,
 think go significant distance direction
 recommending even without statutory change. recommending
 seems feasible
 explicit numerical targets.
 adopt something like Neal language context current
 law. would like emphasize 5-year time horizon would
 represent difference now. said lot
 commitment price stability, specific time
 horizon accomplishment, would make us accountable
 would make goal operationally much meaningful.
 adopted that, issue accompanying statement says
 expect continue take short-term policy actions aimed
 stabilizing economy short run. continue take
 short-run actions, ought emphasize would
 case evaluate longer-term objectives.
 Second, refocus longer-term strategy
 way, think would helpful revamp semi-annual
 Humphrey-Hawkins reports way would conform that.
 refocused strategy proposing, main purpose
 report would explain policy actions preceding
 
 -45-
 
 7/5-6/95
 
 six months consistent advancing us toward longerterm objective also explain short-term actions
 might taken deal short-term economic conditions
 consistent longer-term goals. revamp
 report way, think would better position
 communicate policy public Congress would
 help increase credibility.
 Third, operational level, Committee refocused
 strategy way, would need alter conforming way
 short-term policy deliberations refocus terms
 options consider short run. would mean revamping
 Bluebook extent--especially discussion short-term
 alternatives options. ways already done.
 particular, current attention give relationship
 alternative short-run actions one hand
 behavior monetary aggregates reduced
 replaced discussion relationship alternative
 short-term policy actions longer-term inflation objectives.
 Again, already done, evident
 meeting's Bluebook, think need give prominence.
 needs done every meeting, July February.
 Now, recognize well anyone developing operationally
 meaningful linkage short-term actions longer-term
 inflation goals extremely difficult long lags
 time take short-term actions time
 effect inflation. intermediate monetary targets,
 feasible use them, useful. difficult
 issue, think things could do. example,
 Bluebook could routinely assess inflation expectations
 embedded bond rates perhaps speculate alternative shortrun actions might affect expectations going forward. Again,
 done already, effort could sharpened
 given emphasis. might also want experiment sort
 nominal GDP feedback rule, externally internally,
 benchmark considering short-run policy alternatives. Clearly,
 short-term operating issues tough problems
 experimentation needed, think would appropriate.
 may end one last comment, Mr. Chairman, feel
 strongly made enormous progress Federal
 Reserve System last fifteen years moving dangerous
 situation high rates inflation now.
 gone considerable distance increasing credibility
 protectors value nation's money, achievement
 among things helped us foster growth employment

 second part argument is, said before,
