 first, know, happen data distinctli mix,

 get littl weight upsid risk.
 chairman greenspan. presid santomero.
 mr. santomero. thank you, mr. chairman. coupl point. first,

 second, would find hard explain, context data weaker

 march 16, 2004
 
 84 107
 
 believ peopl think behind curv. so, three reason, would
 support recommend.
 chairman greenspan. presid broaddu.
 mr. broaddu. first, mr. chairman, let associ toni’s comment
 bluebook. also felt well thought time, would
 comfort, vincent, put three option, would indic we’re
 expect action altern time go forward.
 polici, mr. chairman, mai outlier even kohn camp. fact,
 finish comment here, might kick kohn camp! guess extrem
 view, let express think need said. look econom
 situat, seem evid labor market date suggest
 slack market diminish increas. me, fundament. i’ve
 think go happen inflat rate risk lie inflat
 go forward. view made good point limit evid, best,
 disinfl actual ceas evid mai continu. also
 impress roger’s comment econom discuss that, kind imbal
 seem have, likelihood increas rel price. don’t discount
 price increas entir, environ risk gener quick
 acceler inflat still seem less would otherwis.
 so, don’t think we’re give enough weight disinfl risk. long
 reflect, conclud ought give greater weight, i’m basic
 altern mode. realiz i’m defin extrem rang view here, wouldn’t
 satisfi even languag altern far assess risk concern.
 
 march 16, 2004
 
 85 107
 
 statement probabl, though minor, unwelcom fall inflat
 diminish recent month. don’t know whether agre that. i’m sure that’s
 case.
 therefor, prefer—and, again, realiz extrem view—is, first
 all, get possibl eas polici statement, least recogn
 possibl. tabl long time, think it’s time consid
 put back on. wai would write two sentenc, call, would
 someth like thi: “the probabl unwelcom fall inflat risen
 modestli recent week appear somewhat greater risk rise
 inflat. consequ, polici eventu need becom less accommod
 economi improv, somewhat greater accommod mai appropri interim.”
 mr. ferguson. therebi make chairman’s recommend seem terribl
 moder! [laughter]
 chairman greenspan. governor bernank.
 mr. bernank. thank you, mr. chairman. appreci anecdot regard
 price pressur, i’m somewhat wari them. think mani reflect salienc

 total cost. second, mai confus high cost rise cost,
 cours, rise cost contribut inflat.
 also, want associ governor ferguson’s point new sinc
 last meet primarili weaken expans, particularli term
 employ statist, strengthen dollar. latter talk
 great deal, downward trend dollar arrest. so, mr. chairman, would
 
 march 16, 2004
 
 86 107
 
 like support statement propos, bia downward, understand
 mai well want come balanc assess inflat sometim soon.
 chairman greenspan. presid mcteer.
 mr. mcteer. agre recommend chang polici. would
 prefer balanc risk inflat. think weak we’ve seen recent
 real side rather inflat side. it’s much phillip curv type analysi
 view two tradeoff wai. would even suggest chang word
 “patienc” time. agre toni lot word us, fear
 start us on time time, we'll get bind “consider
