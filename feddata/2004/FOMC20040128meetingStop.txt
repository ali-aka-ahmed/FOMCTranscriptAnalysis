 particular, measurement issues arise words vague multiple meanings

 sure schedule time read comment minutes. Given couldn’t pull back
 release date—but could always release earlier—I would suggest that,
 go forward, release minutes relatively long window drafting approval
 process. get better faster it, move publication date, can’t go
 way. would leave us room start longer period initially.
 MR. FERGUSON. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you. I’m quite skeptical early release minutes. Let
 say start position minutes must absolutely true transcript
 going released five years later. can’t discussion issue might
 sensitive leave minutes entirely; somebody look transcript later
 say minutes didn’t reflect happened meeting. think that’s
 important consideration.
 think experience, long came 1998

 reasons come early release minutes.

 Let touch two points Roger made, important. One
 may affect Committee’s discussion. balance really don’t think would affect

 that, don’t see affecting discussion meeting

 Another thing do, done, though maybe lot not,

 projections, I’m that. remember “forecasts” are. say every
 six months struggle appear Banking Committees try explain

 said previous meeting—is full vaguenesses here, imbalances there,
 endeavor convey fairly broad sense risks are. point

 would almost prefer, going continue giving sorts projections,

 forecast internally consistent forecast explicit assumptions explicit exogenous

 way evaluate one looking forecasts provide. make
 elaborate would involve difficult process. try average group heterogeneous

 Remember don’t actually function forecasts. quite conceivable,

 Indeed, may noticed, occasion don’t mention testimony

 reason provide it.
 certainly think it’s wise put core PCE, largely doesn’t change

 think there’s nothing gained—for anyway—by expanding role

 California, new governor extent improved economic outlook
 motivated lawmakers break gridlock tackle state’s accumulated long-term
 budget shortfall. late December, legislators voted place long-term deficit reduction bond

 refinance state’s accumulated deficit current previous budget years.
 point, polls show limited public support initiative, governor state’s
 comptroller started big push convince voters approve ballot measures.
 weeks ago, governor turned attention state’s long-run structural gap, proposing

 index 65.9, highest level nearly twenty years; everything strong except
 inventories employment. course confidential Friday.
 contact calls, heard three interesting themes regarding capital
 expenditures, labor markets, prices. First, plans increase capital spending become
 broad-based. encouraged District’s results Board’s recent
 survey: 62 percent respondents District plan increase capital outlays
 next twelve months, 37 percent last June. survey contacts suggest
 that, firms region, replacement demand still driving factor rather capacity
 expansion. Spending continues equipment rather structures. survey also
 indicated tax incentives important District elsewhere, perhaps reflecting
 longer lead time mix industries.
 
 January 27-28, 2004
 
 125 238
 
 continue hear good reports producers telecom equipment heavy
 machinery, orders medium heavy-duty trucks jumped dramatically shipment load
 factors improved. One automaker said fleet sales rental car agencies,
 sluggish since September 11, 2001, finally picked fourth quarter. January,
 automakers expect light vehicle sales 16½ million 17 million units. cautionary note,
 still good deal uncertainty month play even though
 almost end January. contact General Motors pointed half
 monthly sales 2003 took place last six days month.
 second theme hearing labor markets improving, fewer
 reports layoffs plans permanent hires. large temporary-help firms
 contact continued see steady growth workers assignment. One
 noted transitions temporary permanent positions increased recently,
 hearing reports permanent hiring, much involves replacing departing
 workers. District happening levels, including highest ones. fact,
 looking replace four contacts among ranks recently departed CEOs.
 [Laughter]
 third theme that, despite robust demand, hearing mixed stories
 ability businesses increase prices. Several firms unable push modest
 price hikes. large printer told us paper suppliers tried several times raise prices
 none increases stuck. specialty retailer reported consumers buying
 product sale. major airline added fuel surcharge ticket prices abandoned
 eighteen hours later. firms, however, able raise prices reduce discounts.
 Last quarter one Big Three automakers increased average net price—that is,
 
 January 27-28, 2004
 
 126 238
 
 average sticker price minus incentives—for first time five years. heavy equipment, one
 manufacturer pushed price increase, generally hearing fewer price
 concessions. And, course, strong demand internationally, especially China, boosted
 steel prices.
 Turning national outlook, balance numbers strong. strength
 capital spending extends beyond high-tech goods traditional equipment.
 Consumer spending held well, residential investment remains robust. obvious
 exception recent positive news, discussing earlier, payroll employment
 series. December’s data particularly disappointing, especially light encouraging
 claims numbers. Given statistical uncertainties, probably don’t want place much
 weight employment figures least see January’s report.
 generally, GDP outlook close Greenbook’s. near term
 risks regarding inflation appear nearly balanced, said December. see
 urgency changing funds rate target, key question phrase
 “considerable period” post-meeting statement. preference would remove
 earliest practical date. previous statement conditioned phrase low inflation
 resource slack, given conditioning probably retain see
 positive signs employment, hope next meeting.

 UPS contact said UPS had, words, “an explosive December.” Business

 Unless I’m mistaken, Committee members reported indications
 unequivocally benign positive economic outlook number years. sounds though
 we’re back late ’90s perhaps early 2000. That, suspect, reflection going
 economy. Indeed, basis Beige Book today’s roundtable
 discussion regional developments, data forthcoming official agencies,
 experience serves well, going come surprisingly upside. outlook
 seems extraordinarily benign, I’ll get reasons bothers shortly.
 Profits margins high though may peaked probably edging
 downward. stage usual lag productivity growth effects real
 compensation likely result increasing incomes thus provide fairly solid base
 growth consumer spending impact earlier tax cuts fades. wealth effect,
 drag spending quite long period time, back neutral
 possibly turned positive; view, consumer debt service burdens one hears
 private-sector colleagues really overstated. look,
 example, debt service burden home mortgages, find large number
 homeowners refinanced locked low coupon rate average.
 suggests mortgage credit servicing payments going relatively flat irrespective

 consumer credit part household indebtedness, mortgages, course, dominate
 overall household sector debt.
 business side already mentioned financing gap turned

 don’t know whether noticed that, stock market prices rising

 probability drop “considerable period” reference high,
 think is, it’s clear gain waiting. If, indeed, economy buoyant

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ended previous presentation saying

 Total inflation likely fall. haven’t seen closing output gap. situation

 response changing circumstances announce working group disbanded.
 group doesn’t do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t say completed work.

 policies continue evolve go forward regard exactly forecast.
 think that’s fair statement came out. anyone uncomfortable that?
 MR. OLSON. would inclined least emphasize recognize importance

 want emphasize continue look issues communication.
 
 January 27-28, 2004
 
 191 238
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. raise issue. Also missing
 statement actually productive discussion.
 MR. OLSON. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. fact, discussed subject communication
 several hours came number conclusions. makes sound though couldn’t
 agree page number dealing with.

 MR. FERGUSON. would hope get draft redone circulated
 everybody relatively quickly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. rather extensive discussion yesterday whether
 parallel test, work involved staff side side, earlier
 release minutes see goes. don’t single problem telling
 anybody that. fact, view that’s sensible thing do. Let’s see feels
 us first go telling world that’s we’re doing. are, however, different
 opinions deal outside world among us table.
 understanding that?
 MR. SANTOMERO. That’s need document.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s ask Michelle view.
 MS. SMITH. think announce conducting parallel test,
 would forced release minutes early.
 MS. MINEHAN. That’s think.
 
 January 27-28, 2004
 
 193 238
 
 MS. SMITH. would recommend Committee say anything parallel
 testing give opportunity see process works. could
 choose whether make comment.
 MS. MINEHAN. agree that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one cases where, move
 direction, cannot move back.
 MS. MINEHAN. know.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. announcing would actually move
 direction. don’t luxury say we’re contemplating something like
 say made decision transparent.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right. think learned lesson last year. really
 think need agree talk because, talk it, parallel testing
 doesn’t us good.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. regrettable must say, unfortunately
 accurate statement.
 MR. FERGUSON. Well, presume decision, taken yesterday, covered
 security confidentiality rules cover kinds issues.
 MS. MINEHAN. hope so.
 MR. FERGUSON. that’s point trying clear saying
 we’re saying.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Could raise another approach? Maybe won’t like it.
 Michelle gets asked this, could say dealt minutes?
 
 January 27-28, 2004
 
 194 238
 
 MS. SMITH. don’t believe so. think experience pressure
 media public. think issue come Chairman’s Monetary Policy
 Report testimony. Reporters last week saying expect announcement
 meeting conclusion efforts area. don’t think
 luxury.
