 presentation confidence intervals projection seemed us logical
 extension effort. calculated confidence intervals using
 real-time track record staff forecast using stochastic simulations
 large-scale econometric model. thought several purposes could served
 including measures Greenbook.
 One important purpose illustrate much uncertainty surrounds
 staff baseline projection. purpose, confidence intervals calculated using
 actual forecast record staff projection would seem informative
 measures. intervals are, indeed, wide. 70 percent confidence interval
 around projection 5¼ percent unemployment rate fourth quarter
 2005 runs 4¼ percent 6 percent. Similarly, 70 percent confidence interval
 around forecast 1 percent increase core PCE prices 2005 runs
 zero 2 percent. important remember implies

 approach mix allows us undertake calculations cannot

 briefing Board, breaking inflation uncertainty uncertainty
 supply, demand, unexplained equation residual. approach also provides
 us ability compute certain conditional probabilities—for example,

 also continue plot fan charts alternative scenarios
 present Greenbook. Like confidence intervals displayed charts,
 alternative simulations generated using large-scale model. number
 remarked occasion that, reading descriptions alternative
 scenarios, surprised see got GDP growth
 unemployment rate lousy tenths and, scenarios, considerably less
 inflation rate. noted response drawback
 alternative scenarios account covariation shocks
 economy subjected. confidence intervals generated stochastic
 simulations that. placing alternative scenarios fan charts,
 hope provide better perspective much probability
 space exploring alternatives.
 Finally, confidence intervals may provide context Committee
 consider uncertainty surrounding projections include Monetary
 Policy Report Congress. know, forecasts presented ranges
 central tendencies. But, course, ranges central tendencies measures
 forecast consensus, measures forecast uncertainty. Based past forecast
 errors, 70 percent confidence interval surrounding forecast
 unemployment rate fourth quarter year 1¼ percentage points
 wide; contrast, width FOMC’s forecast range unemployment rate
 fourth quarter year ¼ percentage point wide. So,
 considerable consensus Committee expected unemployment rate late
 year, probably much greater uncertainty associated
 individual forecasts.
 Needless say, advertising ignorance explicit fashion gave us
 pause. given increasing prevalence product liability lawsuits,
 thought appropriate warning Greenbook forecast warranted.
 Perhaps confidence intervals viewed something like warning label
 reads, “Do operate large economies influence baseline
 projection alone.” Karen continue presentation.

 Nonetheless, observers arguing patience wearing thin

 three things: first, happened intermeeting period interpret it;
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 65 107
 
 second, happened hypotheses are; third, implications room
 policy.
 First, know, happened data distinctly mixed,
 think David said, somewhat downside least expectations. Three
 four things caught attention. Obviously, labor market numbers somewhat
 weaker anticipated. Importantly, though, demand new vehicles little
 sluggish. Dealer inventories seem rising bit. I’m going come back talk
 touch. housing activity, still strong, also somewhat expectations.
 think someone mentioned private sector put together
 something called “surprise” index. They’ve observed that, second half 2003,
 surprise index tended positive, say data came higher
 expectations. Since December last year data, generally speaking, come
 expectations. think warning sign either expectations far
 line economy, still strong, quite strong people thought. staff
 taken board marking forecast. output gap probably up,
 employment gap up. main focus there, obviously, question job creation,
 quite sluggish.
 that, years formal end recession, still seem dealing
 appears yet another jobless recovery? leads topic 2,
 happened. number theories hypotheses, I’d like go
 quickly. One rapid increase benefit costs discouraged businesses bringing
 new workers. tend put lot weight since think, large, benefit costs
 relatively small compared overall costs hiring workers. probably
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 66 107
 
 industries factor important. hypotheses I’d like spend little
 time already come up, one exception. One structural productivity
 growth may higher thought before. tend put little weight
 argument. looked periods increases productivity growth, think
 we’re middle one strongest periods compared others.
 Historically run twenty years so, one started nine years ago,
 suspect may come here. One things may seeing regard
 story structural productivity it’s little stronger originally thought.
 said, obviously come bit cyclical reasons order job creation pick
 up. lay one option. Tony mentioned another option, bit mismatch
 skills, may lead slower job creation.
 third possibility—one hasn’t talked much—is so-called
 business gloom. find gloom frustratingly psychologically driven, think there’s
 analytical underpinning least ought take moment focus on.
 concern one reasons businesses somewhat gloomy aware much
 increased consumption they’ve seen driven stimulus stimulus
 undoubtedly likely wane course year. certainly case fiscal
 stimulus, though it’s hard say respect monetary policy stage. since
 expectation decreases interest rates, think people would say
 stimulus monetary policy also start wane bit. context uncertainty,
 think businesses concerned sustainable growth consumption going be.
 holding hiring also labor income. one focused yet,
 real labor income increased fourth quarter last year 2 percent

 previous period, slowest quarterly rise labor compensation last year. rate
 increase slowing gradually course 2003, that, think, bit
 problem. believe played relatively weaker, though still strong, demand
 consumer durables—both autos housing—that noted earlier. Auto inventories starting
 build, housing activity, still strong, slowing somewhat.
 Another point I’d make factors holding
 consumption, including equity wealth home prices, may start soften forecast
 period. consumption households still relatively strong footing, don’t see
 strengthening. think there’s risk may weaken bit suspect
 factors supporting going weaker stronger going forward.
 said, it’s clearly case businesses continue fix balance sheets.
 we’ve seen increase capital investment, think part productivity story.
 don’t expect things fall apart completely business side. believe there’s bit
 downside risk perhaps others room feel is, least interpreted
 comments I’ve heard. introduced concept announcing we’re lining up. guess
 I’m lining Kohn–Broaddus view there’s perhaps little downside risk.
 Now, let go third topic—the implications policy. listened
 today, heard two three different themes mentioned I’d like discuss. One issue
 inflation pricing pressure. heard number stories bottlenecks, speed effects,
 forth. struck primarily we’re hearing minor imbalances
 supply demand small number industries may ability change
 output quickly others. I’m sure, context widening output gap,
 problems likely feed inflationary pressures really worry about. I’m
 
 March 16, 2004

 denying pricing pressures may picking areas important
 markets supply demand imbalances may leading price increases. I’m
 sure stage, context squishy—that’s technical term sometimes use—
 [laughter] labor market, we’re likely see big pickup inflation.
 second theme involves question whether risk overstaying
 welcome low interest rate levels. obviously done superb job going
 technical elements that, way attempt mirror. would
 associate comments Don, all, great former member

 hasn’t come yet—that, staff’s recent assessment, real equilibrium interest rate

 interest rates low, shouldn’t complacent it. recognize
 monetary policy may accommodative thought.
 third theme relates communication. point I’d make markets
 expecting changes. Given fragile markets given view perhaps
 there’s downside upside risk, would caution careful
 making significant changes statement. Thank you.

 I’m little concerned so. reason that, move today toward

 tightening, moving direction—at every recent meeting. would create

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 79 107
 
 MR. GRAMLICH. support suggestion, Mr. Chairman. I’m actually altogether
 averse going balance inflation assessment. given we’re coming period
 downgrading forecast economic activity, think I’d rather leave statement alone
 another month. I’m entirely averse minor change, however, that’s do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. want clarify advocating move rates

 keep back minds consider stance policy. Clearly, continues
 output gap. clearly, incoming information suggests economic activity
 less strong earlier, though continues strong. like everybody else, don’t
 know pace hiring slow whether get slower
 speed quickly expect.
 could go along recommendation, Mr. Chairman, fall President
 Poole’s camp, extent agree Ned said. I’d rather say
 probability rise inflation equal unwelcome decline—use phrasing
 alternative C—because closely describes markets others
 seeing. think also conveys slight edging concern—not promise move
 next time time even time that—about long interest rates
 low are. So, margin, would come President Poole one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, think it’s close call whether balance
 inflation concerns. hearing comments, tend agree completely,

 slight preference staying are. think we’re situation today
 fewer changes operative paragraphs, better.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, certainly support proposal. also think it’s
 close call regard balance inflation. must admit recent developments
 energy prices value dollar led conclude probably would better
 talk terms balanced inflation risks. now, could support recommendation.
 think change statement inflation risks imminent; it’s matter exactly
 made.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, would least mild preference
 going balance inflation risks. reason that, listened discussion
 today, struck heard anecdotes seemed consistent possibility
 building inflationary pressures. basis, well factors, balance seems
 genuinely appropriate me. That’s would come issue.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, could support recommendation, share
 view President Stern others discussion around table today sounded, least
 ear, see inflation risks balanced. fact, think may stayed
 phrase “unwelcome decline inflation” long. words statement don’t
 seem reflective discussion morning. would preference
 balanced risks statement inflation. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 81 107
 
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. come surprise one
 least mild preference staying inflation risk toward downside. mind,
 haven’t yet actually seen evidence—we lot anecdotes real evidence—that
 inflation even stabilized. true core PCE moved up, though extremely low
 levels. core CPI continues decelerate even three-month basis. I’d prefer
 certain actual inflation stopped falling convinced outlook
 calls moving balance inflation risks.
 second point think expect total inflation decline relative last year.
 least FOMC members projected inflation 1 1¼ percent year,
 ½ point less 2003. Now, lot reflects projected decline energy prices,
 perhaps it’s unwelcome, total expected fall.
 finally, perspective, risk-management sense, decline inflation
 current levels—if it’s tenth so—is unwelcome increase.
 think inflation low level decline welfare costs potentially time
 rise. don’t expect much happen, cost–benefit analysis, downside risks
 get little weight upside risks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. couple points. First,
 support recommendation, although marginal preference wording “about
 equals.” think “about equals” shaded somewhat left “appears almost equal.”
 say, lots words English language, “about equals” epsilon
 right “almost equals.” guess could come another word wanted to.
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 82 107
 
 could ad infinitum scale “really equal” “sort equal.” [Laughter]
 preference wording strong one.
 Let take opportunity, however, make comment Bluebook. One
 changes time structure Bluebook elimination three options
 changes funds rate. think made absolute sense, given are, also
 believe could cause us problem road. things equal, would prefer
 three options presented, dismiss don’t find relevant. say
 see world sometime future, perhaps different Chairman,
 there’s minority view either increasing decreasing rates opportunity support
 move made difficult it’s Bluebook. take away
 obvious decision we’re making time. general matter, think makes
 sense leave structure Bluebook spend extra page it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Mr. Chairman, also support recommendation
 language, given comment that, make change, markets going view
 first step sequence expect changes subsequent meetings.
 admit also mild preference going balance risks inflation. Again,
 though, support recommendation language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, I’d prefer move balanced statement
 inflation risks think risks fact relatively balanced now. would
 choose disagree stronger preferences might held others around table
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 83 107
 
 believe really making change time. That’s
 important decision point, think.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. sympathetic concerns
 others expressed, view shouldn’t make changes, I’d keep
 slight shading balance risks language is. view couple reasons.
 One market seems expecting little change see reason surprise
 market something else stage. Last time made everyone room
 relatively small change—moving “patience” language—to give us flexibility.
 market reacted quite strongly. I’m quite sure anything like
 time around. reasons pointed out, Mr. Chairman, we’re exactly starting
 new path yet.
 Second, would find hard explain, context data weaker
 expected, Committee would alter view inflation picture opposite
 direction. seems inconsistent language changes want make.
 Third, point made earlier, think one’s assessment depends degree one’s
 view we’re starting terms inflation dynamics. said, I’m sympathetic
 concerns expressed rising inflation; we’ve heard lot stories anecdotes
 markets prices seem picking up. I’m sure need start signaling
 greater worry inflation point forecast output growth slow
 output gap widen. Again, seems internally inconsistent. Therefore, would leave
 wording statement is, least stage, wait see incoming data tell
 us forecast might change. wait May make language change, don’t
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 84 107
 
 believe people think behind curve. So, three reasons, would
 support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. First, Mr. Chairman, let associate Tony’s comments
 Bluebook. also felt well thought time, would
 comforted, Vincent, putting three options, would indicate we’re
 expected action alternatives time going forward.
 policy, Mr. Chairman, may outlier even Kohn camp. fact,
 finish comments here, might kicked Kohn camp! guess extreme
 view, let express think needs said. look economic
 situation, seems evidence labor market date suggests
 slack market diminishing increasing. me, fundamental. I’ve
 thinking going happen inflation rate risks lie inflation
 going forward. view made good point limited evidence, best,
 disinflation actually ceased evidence may continuing. also
 impressed Roger’s comment economic discussion that, kinds imbalances
 seem have, likelihood increases relative prices. don’t discount
 price increases entirely, environment risk generate quick
 acceleration inflation still seems less would otherwise.
 So, don’t think we’re giving enough weight disinflation risk. long
 reflection, concluded ought give greater weight, I’m basically
 alternative mode. realize I’m defining extreme range views here, wouldn’t
 satisfied even language alternative far assessment risks concerned.
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 85 107
 
 statement probability, though minor, unwelcome fall inflation
 diminished recent months. don’t know whether agree that. I’m sure that’s
 case.
 Therefore, preference—and, again, realize extreme view—is, first
 all, get possibility easing policy statement, least recognize
 possibility. table long time, think it’s time consider
 putting back on. way would write two sentences, call, would
 something like this: “The probability unwelcome fall inflation risen
 modestly recent weeks appears somewhat greater risk rise
 inflation. Consequently, policy eventually need become less accommodative
 economy improves, somewhat greater accommodation may appropriate interim.”
 MR. FERGUSON. Thereby making Chairman’s recommendation seem terribly
 moderate! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. appreciate anecdotes regarding
 price pressures, I’m somewhat wary them. think many reflect salience
 commodity energy price changes we’ve seen. first, know small part
 total costs. Second, may confusion high costs rising costs,
 course, rising costs contribute inflation.
 Also, want associate Governor Ferguson’s point news since
 last meeting primarily weakening expansion, particularly terms
 employment statistics, strengthening dollar. latter talked
 great deal, downward trend dollar arrested. So, Mr. Chairman, would
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 86 107
 
 like support statement proposed, bias downward, understanding
 may well want come balanced assessment inflation sometime soon.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. agree recommendation change policy. would
 prefer balanced risks inflation. think weakness we’ve seen recently
 real side rather inflation side. It’s much Phillips curve type analysis
 view two tradeoff way. would even suggest changing word
 “patience” time. agree Tony lot words use, fear
 start using one time time, we'll get bind “considerable
 period” phrase. So, would happier found word equally strong
 “patience”; think would helpful change word don't get locked in. Back
 played tennis, receive serve, didn’t stand flatfooted.
 would keep moving feet you’d able go either way. think word “patience”
 leaves us flatfooted.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, I’m comfortable
 recommendation policy statement. think it’s true anecdotal
 information prices worse since last meeting. numbers haven’t moved.
 statement already reads risks inflation quite close balance. “Almost equal”
 quite close. [Laughter] basis, I’m comfortable suggestions proposed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation, would prefer keep
 slight bias emphasizing possibility disinflation. One things makes
 
 March 16, 2004
 
 87 107
 
 uncomfortable making change—going back comment like fan
 charts—is inflation “fanning” around 1 percent, personally think 1 percent low
 number. Also, economic consequences going on. companies manage
 earnings statements financial institutions operate extremely low interest rates
 implications economy. That, plus fact haven’t seen data actual
 evidence stabilization inflation, leads prefer retain bias toward weakness.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, close call whether would bring
 inflation risks balance—and think close call—then strong preference
 changing statement little possible. seems that, past made
 significant changes statement, market overread significance
 confused trying communicate. changes proposed
 statement today view reflect minimal change outlook taken place
 intermeeting seven-week period. think ought go statement suggests
 outlook changed minimally. support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. close decision actually—not much
 numbers fact us, best judge, could go either way to. It’s
 close call. think Governor Olson probably correctly summarized stand.
 there’s lot said President Poole’s argument it’s really going matter
 much matter data show. way think it’s probably best
 us nothing let market essentially move expectations federal funds
 rate. Therefore, let’s statement read essentially involves change.
