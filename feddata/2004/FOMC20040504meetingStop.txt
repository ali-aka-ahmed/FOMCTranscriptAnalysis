 Third, true recent inflation desirable level. hear people

 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. last meeting, Greg Ip wrote

 Taking reverse order, I’m impressed late leisurely strategy. give

 backdrop, think clearly two important questions. One relates
 starting: level inflation we’re starting low originally
 thought? second is, outlook inflation? first question basically comes
 whether overestimated falloff inflation last several quarters. think staff
 Atlanta Fed—and many others—would say number transitory factors
 affected inflation picture 2003 led us believe underlying inflation lower
 actually was. may well true, think basic contours picture really haven’t

 May 4, 2004

 obviously comforting mean starting relatively low level inflation.
 close reaching kind inflation that, reasonable view, would
 considered inconsistent price stability.
 second important question whether pickup inflation we’ve seen
 recently, we’ve heard room anecdotal information sources,
 would likely require relatively rapid policy response starting near future order
 maintain rate inflation that’s consistent price stability. would come down, though
 somewhat uneasily, general view Greenbook probably right—that
 inflation clearly stabilized may pick somewhat point fear
 falling behind curve.
 Let first talk easy part assessment. think March surprise CPI
 likely adjusted somewhat forthcoming data. us well aware
 saw March reflected transitory effects upside, offsetting relatively noisy
 data components apparel lodging away home. I’m trying underplay
 March surprise, think cautious putting much weight since
 may adjusted going forward. fundamentally, though, question whether
 outlook inflation deteriorated much need signal dramatic change
 views. would admit tough call. number different models inflation,

 one thinks various theories inflation, one must say would perhaps
 lead upside concern; issue pass-through commodity-price increases could
 surprise us upside. true markets expect commodity prices come bit,

 Chairman Karen discussing earlier, surprised score. also

 view, worrisome issue commodity prices—where large
 think standard wisdom likely hold—is question inflation expectations inflation
 dynamics. us concerned consistent series upside surprises inflation might
 start become embedded inflation behaviors inflationary expectations. something
 certainly aware of. Ned talked mistakes institution made ’60s ’70s.
 think many mistakes traced back misunderstandings dynamics
 economy also willingness Committee point buy special stories
 explain almost every upside surprise. careful quickly reject whole
 negative scenario respect inflation inflation dynamics come upside
 surprises.
 putting weight things, general view greater probability
 inflation pick relatively slowly point. would still say tend focus
 traditional views drives inflation. think continues great

 previous meeting previous several meetings. Labor markets clearly completely
 recovered. true we’ve one good data report, careful interpreting
 that; we’ve head fakes regard past. would say rate hiring still

 likely increasing gradual rate. Finally, would say structural productivity

 So, stage come down—admittedly somewhat uneasily—agreeing general
 sense Greenbook inflation likely pick gradually going forward.
 suggests that, get second round discussion today, may two
 three ideas would hope could agree on. One clear recognition risks
 obviously become balanced respect inflation we’d lose credibility

 think continue process clearing impediments raising rates neutral

 pace moving rates back neutral likely. definition, we’re going driven

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. take opportunity last time, guess,
 say agree President Broaddus. prepared meeting, found
 changes since last FOMC meeting significant. looked different indicators
 track, saw change quite long time. want talk three aspects
 data ended focusing on: inventories, employment, various inflation indicators.
 
 May 4, 2004
 
 68 112
 
 Let start inventory growth. think surprised little
 inventories grew last months, even Greenbook estimates. one looks
 historical trend inventory–sales inventory–consumption ratios, remarkable
 downward trend ratios began ’90s continued—except slight
 flattening wholesale manufacturing inventories recession. fact, even Greenbook
 forecast inventory accumulation year, based recent changes GDP numbers,
 suggests level inventories 2004 less held companies 2000, despite
 double-digit sales growth intervening four years. So, happening companies’
 inventory management practices?
 Recently opportunity financial officers several different types
 businesses, one things found anecdotal commentary mixed.
 Particularly among manufacturing industries, still lot caution there. tended
 firms suffered lot industries real pressure profits. Perhaps like
 company President Pianalto talked about, they’ve worried building book sales
 trying get inventories even further. hand, folks
 retail industry told stories continue path substantially changing
 way integrate information systems across companies, going prospect books
 sales forces order books inventory management. lot accomplished
 regard, many financial officers felt still significant ways could
 continue improve management inventories. Manufacturing firms also this,
 started cautious side retailers, talking
 improving inventory management processes.
 
 May 4, 2004

 terms employment, glad see March first time
 growth payrolls. I’m still little pessimistic long since we’ve seen real job
 growth. clearly one indicators I’m sure hope showing sustained
 growth going forward. Payroll income moved lot last couple years,
 personally concerned that, tax refunds played year see slowing
 pace equity extractions housing due rising mortgage rates, need
 significant payroll growth order sustain strong level final consumption.
 finally inflation numbers, amazing March meeting every
 indicator inflation came suddenly showed reversal trend saw 2003.
 2003, every month—and even twelve-month rollover measure—rates inflation continued
 fall. really changed, anecdotes many mentioned previous
 meetings come bear. looked various pieces inflation picture, focused
 question already asked: something fundamental happening,
 attributable unusual events? Clearly, issues commodities we’re seeing
 worldwide demand-driven price changes. overall amazing prices goods
 side generally stopped decline—a decline obviously helped lower overall
 inflation rate last couple years. true everything used cars apparel;
 it’s raw materials commodities prices. side, though, rate inflation
 services—which relatively high last couple years—has continued come
 down. one takes medical services particular, clear rate inflation
 services continuing moderate. since services big part economy,
 trend continues believe help offset lack price declines goods side
 go forward.

 regard outlook inflation, number indicators look at.
 one, many mentioned, “gap.” uncomfortable gap analysis
 basically two reasons. One requires view inflation projection
 perspective regression analysis, kind analysis always large element potential
 error it. projected inflation rate current rate, we’re never quite sure whether
 fundamental change structure economy, isn’t captured
 regression, whether actual inflation rate eventually going move up. consequence,
 unless projections right money time, almost invariably not,
 always serious questions whether gap regression analyses really telling us
 something need know.
 Second, question whether single figure describes process. number
 mentioned skilled labor shortage. soft rise wages salaries
 production worker data suggestive development we’re aware of—namely,
 skill differential rising fairly dramatically. result, shortage skilled
 workers corresponding surplus lesser-skilled workers. I’ve argued certain

 last four quarters sector registered average price rise neighborhood

 actual underlying unit costs rising modestly, result combination declining unit
 labor costs declining unit interest costs, offset part rising costs energy, indirect business

 understand issue whether mis-evaluated data prices last year and, hence,
 operating presumption inflation gotten lower actually did.
 think important question unit costs doing. Consequently, trying get

 Earlier, Mr. Chairman, told could thirty additional seconds talk
 today. may five seconds here, I’d like quickly share little anecdote may
 enjoy. may recall last meeting pretty much one end
 spectrum—even beyond Kohn camp. [Laughter] paid hands colleague,
 Jack Guynn, days ago. Jack, course, President Atlanta Fed, Sixth
 Federal Reserve District. may know, actually born Fifth Federal
 Reserve District, Shenandoah Valley. nice younger brother named Doug,
 prominent attorney there. make speech area couple weeks ago, Doug
 kindly invited stay him. Jack happened well. Doug wonderful
 house overlooking mountains, gave beautiful room stay in, first time
 career, bouquet flowers room. Doug kept asking look
 carefully flowers. couldn’t understand until, eventually, saw flower
 arrangement carved wooden dove sent brother, Jack. [Laughter] Jack, really
 hurts! hope take comfort I’m bit closer center gravity today.
 MR. GUYNN. fun!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well done. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support recommendation, I’ve
 looking carefully sentence 8, Cathy talked about, March FOMC
 statement shown alternative B. compare word-by-word even phrase-by-phrase,
 see minor differences—primarily removal word “patient” addition “is
 likely measured.” read two, think alternative B comes across much
 strongly, think it’s position word “remove.” We’re talking
 point future policy accommodation removed. We’re describing circumstances

 never good judging market response statements be—if there’s stronger
 reaction many around table suggesting. said that, think
 statement exactly accurate. recognizing review generally within six-week
 time frame, seems appropriate way describe today.

 language, find hard disagree language people respect call “brilliant”
 “extremely good,” must say I’d prefer different path. would prefer drop word
 “patience” substitute word “measured.” don’t like putting another word
 lexicon now. think going pose problems us road whenever try take
 out. realize wording going approved, I’d like make couple comments
 next time issue comes views least record.
 First all, point conditioned four times, remember Jackson
 Hole conference lot discussion whether markets understand central
 banks’ conditioned statements, clear consensus “no.” view
 conditioning statement central bank doesn’t mean anything markets. read
 unconditioned.
 Second, Cathy’s Don’s point line 8, part sentence think
 important—namely, “with inflation low resource use slack,” agree
 
 May 4, 2004

 somewhere statement—could moved line 3 incorporated rationale section.
 think would describe situation without provide forward-looking
 element—in words, without adding “measured.” So, balance, would prefer take
 word out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, expressed opinion somewhat earlier

 we’ve decided today, support that. think would better served

 support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, still camp would prefer
 commitment statement. like idea many us expressing
 speeches—that policy accommodation removed. struggled with—and
 interested listening said around table—was word “measured.”
 outsider trying read message word, I’m sure would know
 means. trying signal slower pace ’94—a gradual moderate preemptive pace? guess we’ve come word don’t know meaning of. idea

 MS. BIES. guess I’m asking, don’t say pace policy

 something like rather use code word “measured.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. thought that’s interpreted word mean.
 MS. BIES. Well, I’m hearing lot different interpretations it, even around table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suggests nineteen people

 MR. MCTEER. also would prefer drop “patience” without substituting anything

 judgment we’d create problems changing wording statement not.
 think two-step move—
 MR. MCTEER. understand practical problem going two steps, think ought
 least recognize that. “Like fish” think term used high school.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want make couple points. First all,
 regard long-term inflation expectations, I’m going use analogy federal funds
 futures market. Take reading September futures market. interpret
 providing us evidence state economy market’s expectation
 Committee going do. think that’s information extract
 observation. token, think long-term inflation expectations extract
 inflation indexed bond really statement market’s expectations
 Committee going period years. can’t extract real information relevant
 
 May 4, 2004
 
 99 112
 
 understanding underlying inflationary pressures. It’s really statement Committee
 likely do. indexed bond starts move, information, like September
 futures reading, represent market’s changing view Committee going
 react future. starts move—if moves upside—I think mean
 beginning lose credibility. That’s way would interpret it.
 Second, agree Bob McTeer regarding inflation risks. problem
 it’s transparent use language ostensibly state world
 forecast hint probable future policy stance. unfortunate. don’t think
 there’s anything right understand two-step move would
 send signal. However, think it’s unfortunate mixed-up language
 principle ought state economy assessment interpreted
 indication policy stance going be.
 share view going cold turkey taking “patience” probably
 counterproductive, given history “a considerable period,” “patience,” “measured.”
 think market going read “measured” nuance “patience.” I’m concerned that,
 think need try find way extract kind language. would like
 see language along following lines substituted point: “The Committee expects
 future policy stance depend future pace economic growth developments
 regarding inflation risks.” That’s statement policy going depend incoming
 data and, course, implications data assessment risks going forward.
 plain statement along lines good substitute current language.
 don’t think eliminate language cold turkey; that’s going cause sorts
 questions misunderstandings. substitute something eventually. would try

 substitute something gets us “considerable period,” “patience,” “measured”
 progression. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.
 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation. think
