 Committee discussion? President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Seventh District economy firmed

 terms pricing, suppliers finding somewhat easier pass higher costs along

 addition, weaker dollar raising wholesale prices imported goods, large specialty

 Turning national outlook, clearly economy emerged midyear soft

 good news, contacts less skittish outlook demand. data
 anecdotes don’t seem point widespread surge growth. feels like growth
 modestly faster potential, despite substantial degree monetary accommodation.
 Two factors seem holding back growth: first higher energy prices, we’ve
 talked lot—and we’ve seen quantitative estimates impact—and second
 business caution. Even though businesses seem sanguine, continues underlying
 hesitancy take large-scale investment hiring commitments.

 Sarbanes–Oxley leading significant, think still evolving, changes
 decisionmaking. Corporations seem risk averse. operate veil caution. hear
 repeated stories companies making decisions much slowly. addition, they’re discarding
 projects might otherwise undertaken. Now, quantifying factors hard.
 Statistical models give us idea higher energy prices holding back activity,
 give us little guidance calibrate influence higher risk aversion. Nevertheless,
 believe it’s likely significant. context policy, uncertainty makes

 see energy prices raising long-run inflation expectations see business caution

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll start report Wal-Mart

 Consumer spending solid retail travel sectors. ports extremely busy

 report slower demand growth earlier year. Finally, job gains remain modest
 District, unemployment inched slightly. result, labor supply remains

 Turning national economy, recent data economic activity flashed

 trendlike—not nearly robust strength saw last year. spite small uptick

 Greenbook forecast, even revised Friday, sobering. shows meager
