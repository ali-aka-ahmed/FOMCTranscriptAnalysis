 focuses exchange rate trade exposure U.S. industries. scenarios
 closing U.S. trade deficit involve depreciations dollar exchange rate
 currencies. Yet depreciations affect U.S. producers similarly.
 background material provides various industry-level details. remarks today,
 highlight four broad points. First, trade-oriented industries United States
 manufacturing sector account almost half manufacturing
 employment. also high-trade-oriented raw-materials industries. Second,
 trade-oriented industries ones expected stimulated dollar
 depreciation. Moreover, currency dollar depreciates important;
 U.S. industries experience greater stimulus dollar depreciates euro
 yen, example, yuan. Third, many industries, rates

 decades. evidence reduced import-price responsiveness exchange
 rates commodities, declines pass-through may temporary.
 fourth point high-trade-oriented industries United States may
 account bulk import export adjustments induced dollar
 depreciation.
 begin turning levels international trade exposure specific U.S.
 industries. discuss three forms trade exposure: (1) producer export orientation—
 size exports share producer shipments; (2) extent foreign
 producers penetrated U.S. markets; (3) industry use imported inputs
 production processes—the share production costs attributable imported
 components machines. define high-trade-oriented industries export
 orientation 20 percent import penetration 20 percent. industries,
 shown exhibit 1, concentrated manufacturing sector include chemicals;
 machinery excluding electrical; computers electronics; electrical equipment;
 transportation equipment; miscellaneous manufacturing, toys jewelry;
 leather products, small industry United States. Taken together,
 industries account 44 percent U.S. manufacturing jobs. Outside manufacturing,
 raw materials sectors also heavily trade oriented either exports imports.
 Moreover, broaden criteria allow narrow focus import
 penetration, also include apparel, primary metal manufacturing, furniture
 fixtures. dark blue bars exhibit 1 show industry export shares, red

 case fiscal policy can’t adjust case monetary policy, that’s fine. That’s

 [Laughter]
 MR. GRAMLICH. Well, I’m sure I’ll get answer. Actually, I’m sure
 totally grasped this. looking exhibit 1, suppose dollar changes lot.
 three ramifications industry you’ve highlighted. One costs go up, that’s

 MS. GOLDBERG. I’ve done bit limited I’ve looked historically

 thing I’ve looked at, industry-level detail, sensitivity

 exercise that, dollar depreciates, exports types industries respond
 significantly, revenues get really big boost. import side, though, industries
 it’s different story. look overall U.S. economy much spending,
 say, imports transportation goods abroad, find sensitivity

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. I’d like take us back point Linda made
 passing it’s one worries bit. sense adjustment

 involved also would switch nature goods, move toward fewer
 investment goods perhaps final consumption goods. you’ve looked this—
 particularly you, Karen—have thought much implications would
 U.S. economy get disorderly type situation—in even less benign case
 described list implications exhibit 4? suspect one would less
 investment potentially slower productivity growth long term. Linda, maybe
 could start picking points making passing Governor
 Gramlich investment goods versus consumption goods. might adjustment play
 it, broadly, implications that?
 MS. GOLDBERG. Well, dollar depreciation part larger switch investor

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. lot adjustment takes differential

 MS. JOHNSON. Yes. Indeed, background paper reported another model

 MR. FERGUSON. think degree conclusion this, Karen—

 quite right. There’s obviously reason us worried outcome even

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. First, let compliment everybody made presentation today
 wrote papers think extraordinarily good job—for
 us don’t live arena time—of making lot complex things quite
 interesting quite compelling. want ask couple questions, want
 make comment.
 first question relates seems difference two papers
 regarding impact depreciation dollar overall price changes, measured
 PCE Board staff does. looks though Linda’s presentation suggests impact
 may third bigger. wondered got numbers right not, may
 have.
 second question reaction Karen’s statement people
 countries concerned this. may be, terms portfolio analysis,

 somehow involved, see could cause concerned. People
 countries know adjustments side need bigger time goes by,
 impact could get bigger well. So, surprising every bit
 concerned think ought be. worries concerned.
 Finally, thought first chart external adjustment material interesting.
 chart bottom right-hand side U.S. saving investment shows time
 great deal net domestic investment bust 2000 stock
 market correction forth. substantial amount net foreign lending.
 made point that, net saving continued level 2000, say, current
 account deficit wouldn’t anywhere near big is. That, course, corresponds
 pretty much time swing fiscal deficit something like plus 2½ percent
 GDP minus 4 percent GDP. recently hosted conference everybody
 quoting Herb Stein time fiscal deficits trade deficits. Every speaker
 started quote Herb Stein. One speakers—actually Ted Truman—
 made point twin deficits aren’t twins share lot DNA, DNA
 related national saving rate.
 seems don’t lot options terms correcting something that—
 though getting bigger consequences sense dire time—
 ultimately come end. view, one ways policymakers would
 control outcome would something fiscal deficit. rather

 seems something may deserve little attention.
 MS. JOHNSON. Let answer questions reverse order, don’t mind.
 difference conclusions draw pass-through, think
 would worth airing little.
 might ask, extended saving line, wouldn’t everything
 wonderful? point panel saving investment relating

 importantly interest elasticity components domestic demand, interest

 exercise, filling hole fiscal policy, get back fairly substantial amount
 domestic demand. adjustment get external balance portion—and
 could even small portion—of change made fiscal spending started it.
 MS. MINEHAN. basically would need three things happen domestically
 one internationally. international side, foreign economies grow faster.
 Domestically, saving, hopefully much less investment,
 fiscal deficit go little.
 MS. JOHNSON. Right. think we’re confusing endogenous exogenous things here,
 makes little nervous. somewhere along way needs mechanism

 MS. MINEHAN. 30 percent figure there. 30 percent better

 June 29-30, 2004
 
 37 203
 
 MS. JOHNSON. take thirty seconds question whether numbers
 exhibit 4 big little, turn pass-through question. true
 37 percent GDP Europe 56 percent GDP Canada shown exhibit
 big numbers. remember, basis, capital output ratios economies numbers
 like 300. So, though economies hold claims assets multiples GDP—and
 claims United States may 60 percent GDP—you want put
 perspective.
 MS. MINEHAN. Oh, okay.
 MS. JOHNSON. We’ll turn pass-through question. Linda.
 MS. GOLDBERG. disagreement think pass-through is.
 I’m guessing that, end, won’t much disagreement going forward
 might appear. Let go difference is. talk pass-through
 exchange rates, I’m referring pass-through exchange rate movements import prices,
 I’m giving rule thumb pass-through one-half. Board’s simulation model,
 think it’s third, 30 percent.
 MR. GAGNON. 25.
 MS. GOLDBERG. It’s 25 percent Board’s simulation model.
 different sensitivity import prices exchange rate changes, number effects
 terms see materials. Looking exhibit 5 Karen’s Joe’s
 material, disorderly adjustment scenarios, pass-through exchange rate movements
 import prices higher, would import-price response core PCE
 response. We’d probably well larger relative price adjustment imported
 domestic goods, would see net export response, expenditure switching
 
 June 29-30, 2004
 
 38 203
 
 going model. That’s change would manifest scenario; higher
 pass-through would give inflation net export response.
 question is, disagreement? Part reflects
 estimate this, part reflects view current data relative history. recent
 history relevant? longer history relevant? see pass-through
 decline; seemed lower 1990s. recent price observations,
 low side, still within historical bounds. it? permanently lower
 relationship, low side something historically high low?
 tend go longer history part because, we’ve strong dollar period, foreign
 producers able quite profitable build margins. also gives
 scope accepting lower margins while, that’s finite process.
 One interpretation that, 2002 early 2003, foreign producers living fat
 strong dollar period, maybe that’s long-run relationship locked in. Also
 think Asian countries, China’s prices haven’t changing dollar
 currency pegged dollar, China’s competitors might constrained
 moving prices. Whether something persist debatable.
 MR. GAGNON. think agree we’ve seen past and, course,
 wondering happen future. I’d like say believe lot
 differences views come think commodities. That’s issue
 consider going forward. looked import prices, disaggregated aggregated.
 look aggregated import prices, tend put commodity prices separately
 regression addition exchange rates. We, too, find less pass-through

 1990s. question is, story lately? think that’s may
 difference.
 past months we’ve saying rise prices occurred
 commodity prices rising, think exchange rate component
 also large cyclical component—domestic demands China or, broadly, world
 demand component. mind, may explain pass-through seems higher
 lately. Time tell turn right. Frankly, lot sympathy
 perhaps return higher pass-through future think, Linda said, lower
 pass-through ’90s might time China’s economic growth
 rising currency pegged dollar. Even though lot countries Asia
 exchange rate movements ’90s, compete
 integrate production processes Chinese, 800-pound gorilla
 couldn’t really compete against. forced price along China, China’s
 currency tied dollar thus pass-through estimates would fall. we’ve
 looked bilaterally countries seemed passed less 1990s,
 Japan, developing Asia, Mexico. it’s quite possible that, China revalue think
 change respect, bets could off. Maybe we’d go back historical passthrough. jury that.

 talking about, struck chart 10 arguing inflation we’ve seen derives
 primarily two sources. One involves gap-type analysis you’re evaluating terms

 rising rapidly yet inflation continued decline. Now, strong speed
 effect, shown period, didn’t. we’ve looked hard
 econometrics, we’ve done case studies, neither approach leads us think there’s
 much there.
 respect direct monetary influence—whether money shows inflation—we
 think it’s important, think it’s important setting background factors believe
 influence inflation dynamics fundamentally. think monetary policy

 MR. STOCKTON. I’d say two factors behind revisions made federal

 President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. expansion Seventh District
 appears extremely broad-based. sectors weak, booming. may
 hyperbole, several contacts said business climate strong
 remember. One directors, whose private corporation shows forty different
 businesses, said can’t recall many companies many different industries
 well. Similarly, national temporary-help firms headquartered District report
 business finally following classic recovery growth path. Chicago Purchasing
 Managers’ report, released morning, continued show expansion, albeit

 heavy-duty trucks would rise 300,000 last year 370,000 2004 460,000
 2005.
 So, given expansion real activity seems solid footing, I’d like
 focus we’ve heard emerging inflationary pressures. Certainly, firms
 reporting price increases. Euphemisms like “price restoration” “fuller pricing” common.
 price increases related higher energy costs strengthening worldwide demand
 steel commodities. know prices many commodities come late,
 mentioned before, still early know whether they’ve peaked. Many
 reports suggest bottlenecks sectors sales increased rapidly, construction
 equipment, agricultural equipment, fiberboard packaging. cases, inventories raw
 materials parts low; others, supply chain bottlenecks led firms use higher-cost
 alternatives like air freight avoid parts shortages production delays. price
 increases become permanent? obviously don’t know yet. One good sign we’ve heard that,
 number contacts said willing accept recently imposed price surcharges
 suppliers, still resisting base price increases. may distinction without
 difference, many contacts seem determined keep pressure suppliers. soon
 commodity prices fall, expect surcharges come off. plans still assume lower
 input costs. contacts report profit margins good, may quite bit
 room absorb cost increases without raising prices. Indeed, get feeling many
 expect hefty profit margins continue indefinitely.

 Turning national outlook, labor markets firming, expansion appears

 MR. BERNANKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like share Meyer’s Rules
 Forecasting, propounded former FOMC member current sensationalist author, Larry
 Meyer. [Laughter] Rule 1, stick forecast long possible. Rule 2, forecast

 [Laughter]
 There’s nothing much needed terms changes forecast real side

 remote not, funds rate would reach come close zero lower bound, development

 waters way robust economic growth important achievement indeed.
 Unlike growth forecast, inflation forecast one Meyer’s rules

 question whether time come switch Meyer’s rule 1 rule 2. wish
 rule 3 would give practical guidance question! [Laughter] key issue, course,
 whether recent increase inflation portends increases whether instead least

 Profit margins, pointed out, upper edge range beyond

 Indeed, beginning see, suspect, effort harvest large profit
