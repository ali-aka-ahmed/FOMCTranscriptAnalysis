 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. two big questions facing us whether
 recent soft patch economic activity temporary degree underlying inflation

 terms spending, sectors weak activity June showed improvement
 July. particular, retailers told us saw something bounceback; looking ahead,
 merchants sound quite bullish upcoming holiday season planning build
 inventories accordingly. know, light vehicle sales also bounced back July. far, reports
 suggest sales first week August continued strong. One manufacturer even told us
 looking sales month 18½ million units.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Excuse me—was light vehicle total sales?
 MR. MOSKOW. Light. Automakers need good August September clear
 dealer lots ’04 model year cars; otherwise, need reduce production schedules
 ’05 models. sectors never really experienced much slowdown June,
 activity remains strong. pattern evident new orders construction, agricultural,
 mining, equipment well demand advertising. Air travel continued
 move higher summer, bookings solid fall. contrast, information
 heard services suggests weakness.
 second question, outlook inflation, District contacts continue talk
 cost pressures, indications pass-through prices far. There’s much news
 wages, rising health care costs remain major concern. costs material inputs,
 notably construction materials, steel, energy remain elevated. contacts still expect
 
 August 10, 2004
 
 25 103
 
 costs ease, taking longer anticipated. Similarly, supply chain
 bottlenecks discussed last time also taking longer resolve. Capacity constraints
 particularly severe transportation, concerns could persist cause
 substantial problems peak fall shipping season. noted, despite cost
 pressures, we’re hearing limited reports price increases downstream.
 Turning national outlook, think economy’s soft patch temporary.
 July employment report makes us nervous doesn’t change assessment. Assuming
 recent payroll data spurious, risks suggest? One possibility we’re back
 environment similar last year, uncertainty held back hiring even though growth
 continued. course, reasons think uncertainty might risen; we’ve talked
 oil prices, terrorist threats, on. However, business contacts talked
 explicitly increased uncertainty holding back hiring, know indications
 spending showed activity picking July. Moreover, think fundamentals continue
 strong: Real income growth maintained despite weak employment growth
 higher energy prices, still strong underlying productivity growth, monetary policy
 remains accommodative. concerned persistently high oil prices.
 movements seem driven largely geopolitical concerns, Karen discussing, oil
 wild card growth inflation. know sorts supply shocks make
 difficult policy decisions. Still, regard prices, data suggest core inflation remains
 well contained. time continuing remove policy accommodation measured pace

 perhaps little different. Wal-Mart contact said pace sales August definitely
 downshifted. Wal-Mart public story expectation 2 4 percent growth same-store
 sales, apparently internal estimates much closer 2 percent 4 percent. Wal-Mart
 officials reluctant revise estimates publicly 1 3 percent,
 might otherwise do, thought might give pessimistic picture.
 expecting pickup September October, 3 5 percent growth range.
 Several contacts spoke rail congestion. seems real bottleneck
 U.S. railroads days, congestion actually reduced capacity. average
 train speed down, means capacity move freight down. contacts expect
 problem continue year because, course, move fall goods
 moving rails. situation really won’t get straightened early part next
 year.
 think staff outlook economy makes good sense; agree interpreting current
 developments temporary right. employment report, back-of-the-envelope
 calculations I’ve done seasonal factors suggest that, used last year’s seasonals,
 number jobs created July would 80,000 higher reported. I’ll throw
 something think about. Obviously, doesn’t fundamentally change picture,
 gotten 110,000 new jobs instead 32,000, picture would looked little different.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. last meeting, expressed
 concerns uncertain outlook, unfortunately, incoming data verified
 concerns. meeting, think President Moskow opened asking right two
 questions. first is, witnessing emergence another period subpar growth
 likely last several quarters, watching soft patch probability come
 end soon? obviously answer clear, purpose
 willing buy recent staff forecast. However, must admit put much greater
 weight downside risks upside risks. even knowing recent
 anecdotal data, survey data, even high-frequency data suggest perhaps things
 turning.
 
 August 10, 2004
 
 57 103
 
 put greater emphasis downside risks, even new downwardly
 revised forecast? three reasons. First, find entire year trend
 forecasts look at—both staff private sector—has downward.
 Forecasters confronting great deal fog uncertainty almost every time
 forced revise forecasts. one goes back January Greenbook,
 negative scenario called growth first half 2004 4.6 percent, ended
 almost full percentage point that, around 3.8 percent. staff was, think, close
 correct beginning year employment call, projecting unemployment rate
 5.7 percent end first half, far off. know, inflation forecast
 time called core PCE inflation rate 1 percent, we’ve number
 upside surprises there. balance, I’d say very, difficult economy call,
 since even negative outcomes turned understated
 downside, think still need put weight downside risks.
 second reason that, periods great deal uncertainty difficulty
 forecasting activity, it’s obviously instructive look business signals financial market
 credit conditions, meant forward-looking. balance, think
 businesses, consequently markets, indicating least skepticism regarding
 consensus forecast pickup may emerging emerge shortly.
 Looking backward, saw staff presentation Board Monday,
 second-quarter earnings per share continue rise, taken good news—and
 was. However, bad news momentum earnings growth appears slowing.
 second quarter, difference positive surprises negative surprises markedly smaller
 earlier quarters. addition, number high-profile firms provided cautious
 
 August 10, 2004

 outlook earnings growth investors expecting. Taking board,
 financial markets become less positioned for—and think show less foreshadowing of—
 robust growth. Every major domestic stock market index year-end 2003
 last FOMC meeting. drops range 5¼ percent 12½ percent.
 Financing conditions suggest softness well. one example, real interest rates
 Moody’s A-rated corporate bonds fallen, depending adjust them, either

 companies’ investment needs kept pace productivity-enhanced cash flow.
 true side C&I lending moved somewhat, seems
 due much easier terms conditions rising financing needs accounts
 receivable, inventories, capital expenditures. Reflecting weakness consumer spending,
 growth consumer credit also slowed noticeably June, although I’ve received
 anecdotal evidence major credit card issuers suggests least revolving credit demand
 may increased rapid pace July. balance, see financial market
 credit indicators, free contradiction, suggestive uncertainty
 near-term rebound train perhaps consistent extended soft patch—in fact,
 longer period subpar growth.
 final reason siding strongly downside scenarios find
 conditions required return sustained near-term longer-term growth yet
 convincingly place. First, forecasted turnaround near-term outlook driven heavily
 expectation sales automobiles support higher production key industry,
 
 August 10, 2004

 noted interest President Moskow’s commentary August motor vehicle numbers.
 However, President Moskow also pointed auto manufacturers inventory overhang,

 worry that, case capacity utilization, much increase IP socalled upstream industries reflect special situations broad-gauged pickup

 earnings guidance major high-tech firms suggest caution indeed order
 industries automobiles.
 longer-term outlook depends increase pace consumer spending,
 may well challenged number factors. First, energy prices consumers face may
 decline, assumed baseline. Second, may see weaker wealth creation, rise
 housing prices equity wealth slow. Third, addressed others,
 may return normal saving rate. fourth, effects prior tax cuts waning.
 longer-term outlook business investment must also questioned, degree, lack
 strong response date partial-expensing tax provisions, due expire
 year-end. ongoing increases productivity gains state financing gap
 suggest perhaps businesses still finding opportunities use fully current stock
 capital, without investing heavily new capital. downside concerns intensified
 interaction effects among rapidly rising energy prices, heightened geopolitical turmoil,
 cautious consumer business behavior. seen often past macroeconomic
 implications combination outside smooth adjustment process built
 models.

 realize spent time discussing growth. Obviously, dual
 mandate keeping inflation low stable certainly major component. upside
 risk inflationary pressures feared earlier seem abating. scenarios
 Greenbook recognize point inflation remains subdued; least reading,
 market-based indicators inflation inflation expectations corroborate expectation.
 economic slack anything slightly increased unit labor costs productivity still
 performing well, seems significant upside outbreak inflation level
 unlikely. Finally, also recognize impact oil prices tended somewhat
 asymmetric. think prices unlikely major source inflationary impact
 opposed output impact.
 implications policy seems pretty clear. so-called
 measured move proper last meeting, certainly proper meeting. future
 meetings, know markets expect us pause point. far early assume
 outcome, think also far early reject possibility pause going forward.
 Obviously, data help us decide. Given uncertainties confront, hope

 Committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent
 increasing federal funds rate average around 1½ percent.”
 also read sentence regarding assessment risks, Committee also
 voting on. get that, asked note box 4 alternative B—and this,
 guess, would fourth revision—the end sentence says “prices evidently reflect
 transitory factors” read “prices seem reflect transitory factors.” reading
 language shown June FOMC boxes 5 6: “The Committee perceives
