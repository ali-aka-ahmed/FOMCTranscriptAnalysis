 question Janet others raised: Why, stimulus pipeline,
 economy facing prospect low inflation resource utilization gap closes

 I, course, don’t answer question, I’m going offer hypotheses.
 One I’d like reject oil price spike. think Governor Bernanke others
 right seems part negative supply shock early part year.
 oil prices waning, think seems unlikely real source problem
 economy facing.
 Let mention two three likely options. One bursting asset
 bubble series shocks hit United States since early 2001 may

 fallout bursting asset bubble. may be, even better policy mix
 we’ve Japan, still could take longer anyone originally expected
 deal fully fallout bursting high-tech bubble series subsequent
 shocks, think fairly significant. We’ve seen reflected
 phenomenon that’s called “business caution.” I, maybe others, think
 there’s something this. I’ve read views Reserve Bank directors
 communicated letters relating discount rate decisions, number boards
 directors least members—in several Banks, many members—who buy
 view there’s sense caution among businesses. one looks various surveys
 NFIB survey survey Duke University 200 CFOs, talk malaise
 story. survey CFOs indicates expect growth 2.8 percent next
 four quarters, noticeably lower even staff forecast. think business malaise issue
 important watch and, firms go capital planning cycle, believe we’ll get
 information it. think it’s something reject quickly.
 second factor affecting economy described “global
 imbalances.” imbalances country rest world. think
 imbalances within economies, Ned picked this. First, we’ve
 seen financial indicators almost major industrial economies
 marked shown expectation slower growth going forward, has.
 Market participants Japan, euro area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia—in
 industrial economies around world—have marking forecasts economic
 growth. second point make rest world domestic demand
 incredibly weak almost economies. think Ned covered quite well,

 won’t take time repeat except note something one else observed—
 namely, pointed clearly Greenbook Part 2, domestic demand euro
 area growing 0.6 percent. Net exports accounted almost growth.
 obviously we’ve seen marking growth expectations Japan,
 driven primarily net exports. really engine economic growth

 third possible explanation investment new capital goods, high-tech

 two three different hypotheses. whatever explanation
 ultimately proves true—and may those—I think macroeconomic result

 confronting new, less attractive set interactions dynamics include growth final
