 Another disconnect remains, however, eventually must resolved. Greenbook

 minutes convey range views within Committee, expediting

 Now, move direction perfecting equilibrium, important goal

 I’m convinced—and third principle—that times

 represented view one member? I’m quite sure sentence would

 split circumstances, view one member. Disclosure close split

 think agree coalesce behind majority view Committee led, course,
 Chairman, want stifle discussion competing views around table. short,
 hard imagine circumstances expectation early release

 view nature market attention minutes early release
 financial press talks mostly traders traders care little anything short

 don’t care much fundamentals monetary policy. Providing clues next

 I’ll finish unresolved issues. We’ve already talked happens
 minutes meetings held regularly scheduled meetings. incidentally, might find
 problem justify delayed release rather three-week publication
 schedule those. Could Committee discuss possibility intermeeting policy action

 sum, believe early release minutes assist measurably
 communicating fundamentals monetary policy, working toward perfecting rational
 expectations macroeconomic equilibrium. believe early minutes read primarily
 clues Committee’s probable action next meeting. Finally, believe early release
 times market disturber, Committee would better remaining quiet.

 Moreover, think inhibit discussion certain issues regular meetings. However, let
 restate view issue early release closely drawn, I’m predicting disaster.

 Earlier release minutes prove useful aspects intermeeting

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s indeed do.
 MR. REINHART. trying actually write oral tradition, find

 MS. YELLEN. Well, briefly, I’d say definitely support publication

 occasions minutes released point actually misleading

 Let respond Cathy’s point. understand that, Committee decides

 statements. would consider unnecessary unfortunate. support Ned’s comments

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. two comments. First all, see decision as, average, fourweek acceleration release minutes, therefore think two considerations.
 One is, logistical problem early release? Vincent track
 I’ve away office times, realize burden meeting publication

 significant changes minutes result acceleration? won’t really
 know answer get it, think I’d support Don’s evaluation probably
 manageable issue. Also, course, first time release minutes early
 early release. on, scheduled release. think get early release

 Finally, don’t see decision language statement package. think

 corresponding moves along it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Like President Minehan, thought experiment early release
 minutes motivated struggle capturing full sense
 Committee words allowed press statement. also uncomfortable
 code words we’ve using press statement. code words
 proven awkward remove without sending unintended signals markets. still prefer
 shorter post-meeting statement early release minutes.
 also agree President Minehan—especially reading Vincent’s list untested
 aspects experiment—that we’ve conducting best times. led come
 meeting favor Cathy referred middle-of-the-road ground. Let’s extend
 experiment circumstances might considered best times. know
 unpopular position, thought going continue perfect communication
 strategy would one package. see, however, listening colleagues,
 I’m minority view. Nevertheless, want take middle-of-the-road
 approach continue improve communications.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. proposed experiment early release minutes,
 thought addressing questions. first one was, it? need
 change process? focus attention minutes, given time constraints?
 
 December 14, 2004
 
 96 118
 
 given new proposed process, comfortable would released? think
 experiment. think learned lot experiment, everything. learned,
 example, shouldn’t move releasing minutes Friday. also decided
 ought plan publish minutes three weeks meeting. Quite frankly, think that’s
 good addition extra days allow contingencies. believe would harder
 time meeting publication goal ex post started releasing minutes previous
 Friday.
 one never learns everything experiment. things left table,
 shouldn’t surprise us. Nevertheless, new process producing minutes
 timely. brings resources work, hastened attention it, actually
 discussion that’s symptomatic time minutes would released. I, therefore,
 endorse release minutes timely fashion. know there’s concern
 market reactions. market participants grown-ups; they’ll sort out. guess trust
 markets enough think they’ll figure it. also share concern addressed
 President Guynn that, minutes put shelf take
 several weeks later, it’s matter time someone says, “Why that?”
 So, first all, think early release right thing do. know it.
 think puts us situation less disclosure seems appropriate. said
 that, think it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. started process, frankly, quite dubious

 think experiment worked.
 I’m concerned, are, Cathy, question tradeoff respect

 forward-looking projections stick them, extraordinary period

 think go back short term, balanced focus give type indication

 think risks moving forward early release minutes, agree
 way Bill put it—namely, it’s close call. way would phrase essentially that,
 move forward find retrospect mistake, cost large.
 It’s certainly large think would decide move transcript timing

 it’s going big deal.
 would lean toward following Vincent’s recommendation begin expedited
 release minutes February 2005 meeting maintain schedule releasing
 minutes regular meetings three weeks day policy decision. Since perceive
 that’s largely accepted view Committee, I’d suggest put table
 vote. Call roll.

 MR. MOSCOW. Mr. Chairman? congratulate you, too, Vincent, may make one
 minor suggestion?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 MR. MOSKOW. Instead waiting announce minutes come right
 February meeting, would announce early January several reasons. One, think
 would give time markets aware change. put minutes
 meeting, would released February meeting, would give market participants
 twelve trading days new set minutes—those February meeting—will
 released. Second—and hate say this—there’s always chance leak. would hate see
 come announce it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think that’s good point. let ask this:
 reasons announce earlier?
 MR. GRAMLICH. Yes. Let take step further. put something
 statement today?
 MS. MINEHAN. Exactly.
 
 December 14, 2004
 
 100 118
 
 MR. MOSKOW. would strongly support that, it. would soon
 possible. thought you’d want draft wording Committee look first.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let put way. heard discussion
 way would preclude announcing decision today, given we’ve come conclusion
 effectively unanimous—with couple “I guess” votes. [Laughter] unless there’s
 objection, would submit it’s certainly possible today. time put
 sentence statement indicating Committee concluded voted regarding
 issue today.
 MR. REINHART. One possibility, Mr. Chairman, basically pick language
 you, fact, voted on: “The Committee voted unanimously begin expedited release
 minutes minutes February 2005 meeting maintain schedule releasing
 minutes regular meetings three weeks date policy decision.” would also suggest
 put detail, terms paragraph two, minutes meeting,
 market participants know coming. precluded possibility leak,
 market participants get explanation later date.
 MR. MOSKOW. Fine. That’s excellent.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, question we’re proceeding
 early release minutes meeting?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’d say it’s discussion issue occurred

 MR. GRAMLICH. long we’re this, what’s problem? release
 February minutes three weeks, can’t release today’s minutes three weeks?
 MR. REINHART. could release minutes three weeks, direct.
 thought certain advantages paragraph two explaining Committee

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. really necessary?
 MR. REINHART. say isn’t. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, think logic decision forces us
 position precisely Governor Gramlich suggesting. Let ask,
 dissents actually releasing minutes today’s meeting expedited basis?
 MS. MINEHAN. May suggest one possible benefit waiting?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. means, go ahead.
 MS. MINEHAN. shout down, occurs one possible benefit

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Three weeks long time. [Laughter]

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, one question suggestion
 Vincent. Maybe you’ve already considered this. release minutes first time,
