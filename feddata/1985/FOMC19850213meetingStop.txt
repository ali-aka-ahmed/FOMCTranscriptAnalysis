 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. reports

 agenda]? go foreign currency operations first, anyway.

 Sternlight?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.

 Yes am.
 
 Sure.
 
 Well, we'll go Mr. Cross first

 MR. CROSS.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 discussion?
 
 MR. WALLICH. Sam, listening conversations
 Basle, would get impression sentiment intervention
 moving direction all, it's moving direction
 something drastic--perhaps without United States-[say], accumulation resources interest hitting
 market hard dollar already declining?
 MR. CROSS. Well, it's difficult say might
 do. would think desire, obviously, much
 United States: (a) take lead; (b) certainly, participate.
 Now, whether bring large intervention
 absence--if market entirely--looks pretty
 doubtful.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 kind money talking about?
 
 MR. CROSS. don't know anybody talking
 specific amount money. think problem
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 operations undertaken period--certainly
 United States side occasions operated--have
 limited fairly modest amounts. one occasion $40
 million another occasion $48 million; close
 $150 million. certainly feeling one needs act
 greater amounts also greater forcefulness,
 were. understand U.S. view wanting, said,
 bash currency; feel something needs done
 deal exchange rates forcefully done.
 certainly uncertainty market G-5
 announcement meant. time gone by,
 tended fizzle feeling
 intervention, insignificant, really hasn't
 forceful large nature, given magnitude problem.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] go intervention
 least effective way--in fact, would say counterproductive way.
 follow on-MR. WALLICH. Well, may pursue minute. Didn't
 get impression--I myself--that German intervention
 September [1984], massive us appeared heavy
 handed clumsy time, regarded much positively
 really successful operation? Maybe that's
 [why] seem think it's way go--to wait dollar
 softening push down.
 MR. CROSS. Yes, certainly think that. Absolutely.
 tactical move, German operation September introduce
 considerable amount two-way risk uncertainty market.
 heavy seen useful
 attractive operation. Now, subsequent times taken
 similar kinds actions, effective.
 don't disagree you. think powerful impact
 market; period time market wondering whether
 going hit one days. certainly
 introduced certain caution market would think
 useful thing do. certainly, part
 Europeans, strong desire see tactics sort could
 used impact.
 MR. PARTEE. inevitably runs steam, doesn't it?
 mark then? mark/dollar rate
 intervention?
 MR. CROSS. Yes. went day hit
 [hard]; height 3.17 went 4 percent.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 today?
 
 MR. CROSS.
 It's 3.29, September February
 went up. certainly element introduced great deal
 caution market think lasting effect
 period time. day believe spent $400
 million; we're talking massive amounts billions
 spent. think everybody fully cognizant limitations
 intervention; fact, maybe much so. one expects

 2/12-13/85
 
 view that, properly forcefully used, one additional
 weapon helpful keeping quite troublesome
 exchange market situation perhaps little less volatile--I mean
 volatile upward sense.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. side coin,
 though, Henry, nothing happens exchange rate, think
 pretty clear there's likely pressure interest rates
 number countries.
 MR. WALLICH.
 
 Yes, that's point several
 
 made.
 MR. CROSS. think all, certainly lot, Europeans
 going upward pressure interest rates
 exchange rates continue depreciate.
 MR. AXILROD. Governor Wallich, may add [different]
 maybe minority view operation: would tend deny
 success. think rather hit run operation
 failure dollar go up--if that's failure--subsequently,
 lot drop interest rates country
 winter. think expectation [decline]
 coming halt instrumental dollar turning around.
 turned around got point went right it;
 kept going, intervention significant size
 determination forthcoming time.
 MR. WALLICH. I'm simply saying took negative view
 operation; viewed contrary good practice
 driving rate leaning wind. seem take
 positive view it. seem mind repeat
 even though know wouldn't get cooperation
 operation like that.
 MR. BOEHNE. Looking back last 4 weeks,
 going something like this, what's strategy
 way done it?
 we're going it, ought
 conviction it's hardly worth trouble all. seems
 we're intervening though we're kind forced
 really don't want to. intervention doesn't strike
 convincing anybody.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 answering question, Mr.
 
 Cross?
 MR. CROSS.
 don't think anyone disagree
 you've said.
 think you're right: need act
 
 forcefully we're going go there, show mean
 business prepared something token
 amounts.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. several cooks broth
 rather provincial provinces.
 MR. GUFFEY. follow up: talk
 intervention, much control point?
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 all? say, unilaterally, central bank
 do?
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 [unintelligible] central bank.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Okay. may unless others change
 minds don't choice.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 Neither Treasury.
 
 Well, don't operate unilaterally.
 
 MR. PARTEE. episode over, Paul? recall,
 [FOMC telephone conference] call said [to last]
 weeks. weeks gone by. terminated?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. don't think we're bound that,
 particularly. Obviously, haven't acting effectively all-MR. PARTEE.

 That's asked

 MR. WALLICH. Well, think something said
 we've done far. Yes, would better could operate

 Either one.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, wanted ask question Peter.
 Perhaps everybody else room knows this, don't. Early
 talking running compared
 nonborrowed reserve path said year-end $300
 million it.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PARTEE. later came closer
 nonborrowed reserve path.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Now, mean path called
 35% increase? We've large increase nonborrowed
 reserves.
 mean adjust path week week?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 path gets adjusted proceed.
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 MR. PARTEE.
 So, unless know adjustments are,
 don't really know [unintelligible] operation.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. guiding principle drawing path

 Committee's discussion. if, proceed period,
 find required reserves growing substantially, fold
 information--when get it--into revision path.

 raise path?
 
 So, strong monetary growth, you'll
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Yes.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Thank you.
 Unless increase borrowings.
 
 Well, understood say raise
 
 path.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 [Unintelligible.]
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. would alternative
 could come discussion also.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, thought somebody might misinterpret
 said came close path. One needs understand
 you're constantly revising larger growth [in
 required reserves], otherwise one would think
 shooting large rise nonborrowed reserves.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Well, we're shooting accommodate required
 
 reserves--
 
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Whatever called for.
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 MR. PARTEE.

 --at level borrowing.

 recommendation:
 
 comments?
 
 MS. SEGER. question. Hearing comments
 hearing Sam's, wondered: much coordination
 two--[the foreign domestic operations]?
 heard
 talk tilting, would lead higher fed funds rate
 etc., yet heard [Sam talk] problems dollar
 
 rates ticked the-MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, there's close coordination
 operational sense Sam people aware we're
 day vice versa. something like drawing
 paths--whether we're talking $300 million bias
 accommodative side later modifying bias--that
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 coordinated conversations senior staff ensuing
 discussions keep Board informed. Certainly, keeping
 Committee informed reports market: morning call
 weekly reports.
 MS. SEGER. guess I'm saying is: If, saw
 fed funds rate tick also saw rather immediate impact
 foreign exchange markets, we're concerned super dollar
 we're concerned whether we're intervening enough,
 wondered ever close loop get feedback here?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, certainly aware
 happening day-to-day dollar. individual
 days strength dollar fair input timing
 operations--the decision go put reserves

 MS. SEGER. never made think might
 inappropriate allow fed funds rate continue move upward?

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. complete answer,

 I'm trying educate myself.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's good question. [in
 domestic market, generally] operate 11:30 11:45 a.m.
 made decision [after morning call], it's over.
 It's
 revolution operate 2:30 afternoon
 point market sees funds rate going up, raises
 questions whether we're pegging funds rate.
 So, it's
 perfectly reasonable question. fact opportunities
 --just operational basis--during day take account
 [exchange market developments] limited.
 miss
 maybe market wasn't acting way 11:30 a.m., we've missed
 it.
 Now, maybe that's way operate,

 MR. WALLICH. money supply target one

 mean larger funds rate increase done right away.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. may also find fact

 that.

 Well, time
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, 1985!
 comment business price situation. Governor Wallich.
 MR. WALLICH. near doubling--well, maybe quite
 doubling--of unit labor costs little increase [the rate
 of] inflation.
 effect offsetting factors?
 MR. PRELL. Governor Wallich, unit labor cost increase
 last year 2 percent and, said, goes 3-1/4 percent
 3-1/2 percent next year. quick inspection chart
 indicates large gap price increases

 unit labor cost increases past couple years.
 increase markup occurred extraordinary historical
 terms; we're basically seeing narrowing gap
 period ahead. unit labor cost [increases] still running
 little lower price increases.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let ask question following
 terms projections, center 4 percent

 prices year, increase rate price increase
 last year. get little concerned presenting price
 [projections] increasing rate price increase--which show
 great faith Federal Reserve policy--particularly it's
 clear be. decline dollar
 projection--I'm talking projection; basically,
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 I'm talking peoples' projections--but don't know whether
 people assumed decline dollar. Last time used
 convention would not; think assumed general range
 fluctuation within historical experience, seems
 reasonable convention. turned lot better,
 dollar up, we'd assumed depreciation. actual price
 results lower edge projections.
 wonder we're pessimistic prices coming year
 wage trend looks good, dollar continues appreciate, profit
 margins widened, suggested already, unemployment
 rate doesn't go much. One argue productivity;
 staff doesn't terribly buoyant productivity estimates maybe
 everybody else low productivity. would like hear
 [people think] prices going worse year last
 year.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, it's little. 4 percent
 projection guess would say it's much better projection
 midyear year. There's far go!
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Apart decline dollar,

 general view looking price situation one would
 take standard measure productivity and, sense, assume
 markup corporations standard unit labor cost measure--so
 cyclical gains get early rather quickly

 MR. WALLICH. Could ask question that?

 put 70 percent confidence interval around deflator estimate,
 couple times drift range high side.

 whatever it's worth, rate increase deflator one
 percentage point less staff forecast. view
 information saying risks tend skewed
 side. think 3-1/2 percent likely outcome; we're
 wrong, I'd say we're probably high rather low.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES. couple questions, Mr. Chairman. Two
 difficult things forecast, know,
 happen Federal deficit happen dollar.
 wondering sensitivity analysis terms

 dollar supposing there's action reduce Federal
 deficit.
 MR. KICHLINE. Ted, don't know run one

 run one fiscal assumption fiscal action all,
 would add $50 billion dollars, essentially, outlays: $40
 billion outlays $10 billion less taxes. 1986,

 1986 beyond, get something like 1-1/4 1-1/2 percent

 MR. TRUMAN. dollar, taking fourth-quarter

 3rd quarter, get 0.2
 
 next year would get larger impact twice

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. wanted ask question debt
 disposable income ratio. chart shows ratio moving pretty
 rapidly; it's probably near bit 1979 high. know
 accounts run-up debt?
 
 due demographic

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Well, we've investing special effort
 
 lately trying explain behavior debt. major
 ingredient consumer installment credit; growth
 relative income sharp past couple years.
 number factors seem work. One,
 mentioned, durable goods spending exceptionally

 debt intensive. Another factor rather mechanical one: year

 point brought up, feeling comes
 very, forcefully comments directors business leaders

 housing sector. good year,
 things find troubling well.
 Extracting traditional sectoral questions
 risks forecast, seems two
 three generic risks particularly important
 current setting. One is: happens interest rates go
 appreciable way? Let define appreciable
 percentage point short run. Obviously, would
 difficult situation. ask yourself: could
 produce that?
 budget deficit reduced, could
 produce it; dollar declines appreciable way,
 could produce even though cushion dollar decline
 somewhat larger before. result could also come
 economy growing fast because, perspective
 least, balance credit markets precarious,
 indicated one Mike's charts, doesn't take much push
 us situation economy growing fast. Even
 though might reflect price pressures, could
 easily reflected interest rate pressures.
 Then, course,
 always possibility--perhaps remote moment--that
 market could conclude money growth broad sense
 getting away us.
 So, whole collection things,
 one think could produce pressures interest rates.
 think goes without saying appreciable pressures
 direction would throw forecast wind.
 Another thing somewhat concerned terms
 risks burden debt we're accumulating. I'm
 sanguine thought seemed be, Mike, terms
 cumulative effect debt burden--particularly context
 think still fragility financial system.
 don't think crazy new markets instruments
 coming along almost daily helping situation. put
 debt situation one perspective: Since 1982, ratio
 nonfinancial debt nominal GNP risen 17 [hundredths].
 It's
 almost vertical line, level debt right far
 line anything we've ever experienced. That's another
 way looking troubling.
 last thing would mention risk side oil
 price; talked little. surprised
 day point made conversation someone
 regard fairly credible source. nature comment
 among group people thought experts, third
 thought least possibility oil price
 could fall, say, $16 range. one predicting
 hard prediction, least recognition
 possibility fairly knowledgeable sizable group so-called
 experts.
 must say stop try think
 implications that, I'm sure are.
 probably,
 certainly, good.
 So, general, come [the
 view that] everybody feeling good situation right
 getting little worried situation implies
 road.

 MR. GRAMLEY. Well, think forecast many respects
 remarkably good one third year recovery--when growth
 first two years well average first two years
 recovery third year expansion sustained rate
 well potential growth unemployment reduced keeping
 low inflation rate relatively stable interest rates.
 recall--and didn't look up--this forecast '85
 dramatically different staff presented '85 year
 ago swore couldn't happen. we're and,
 look outside forecasts, large number
 centering performance much like one.
 Indeed, put
 forecast, found putting numbers much like
 staff here.
 thinking uncertainties, worries
 what's going happen dollar. Lots people worry
 that, too.
 Oddly enough, people say dollar goes up,
 bad economy ask happen
 dollar goes down, say bad economy, too.
 bad things good things, need keep
 straight exactly going happen either two
 outcomes occurs.
 worry more--a lot more--about what's going
 happen dollar begins fall rises further.
 rises further, put additional restraint
 growth domestic production beneficial effects
 inflation rate beneficial effects interest rates.
 think difficult handle negative aspects
 domestic growth adjustments monetary policy, even though
 worried kind protectionist measures develop [in
 circumstances].
 dollar begins go go
 rapidly, particularly [unintelligible] we're approaching
 natural rate unemployment, it's going stimulate economy
 strongly.
 It's going put strong upward pressures prices and,
 things, strong upward pressures interest
 rates.
 we're going lot problems with. So,
 hope staff right begin get modest gradual decline
 dollar beginning fairly soon.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Sounds like one least likely
 forecasts--not anybody better one.
 MR. KEEHN. comment generally outlook,

 certainly macro broad risk--is agricultural situation.

 almost don't dare mention I'm sure can't say anything
 new surprising you've heard lot it.
 serious continuing deteriorate. one find
 hard get handle on; find difficult measure
 difficult serious problem hunch
 statistics look really don't adequately describe
 problem. land surveys look suggest land values
 30 40 percent peak. isn't much land
 selling; land sell, it's selling 50 60 percent
 peak. People purposely trying hold land
 market [because] real values substantially lower.
 land value goes down, debt [unintelligible]
 get very, high agricultural banks. Cash flow isn't
 going adequate service debt. concern among ag
 banks getting high. went Iowa bankers meeting
 Sioux City last weekend pleased get town one
 piece! pretty close-mouthed problem
 see losses going substantial
 total direct loans farmers indirect loans
 suppliers merchants like. Also Midwest
 lot trading banks around supported loans
 bank stock, hunch problem that's
 going grow magnitude. add together, think
 losses portfolios going substantial. Another
 way saying numbers hide nature problem little
 this: 530 state banks Iowa 15 capital 7
 percent less; 15, 12 6 7 percent,
 would suggest isn't problem capital point
 view. asset quality problems arise, bank go
 capital awfully darn fast sudden escalating
 problem. Superintendent Banks Iowa suggests 140
 530 banks would call problem banks
 means 60 percent capital classified. thinks
 number going go end year half
 banks problem category. all, think,
 small banks somewhat regional problem opposed
 one broad national implications. suggest
 agricultural problem--and, again, can't news you--is
 serious escalating number bank failures
 going significantly higher Midwest year
 case last year. level type institution
 could destabilizing, think risk merits
 notice.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. I've maybe dozen meetings
 past month think gloomiest couple hours I've
 spent! Actually, forecast looks like pretty good forecast
 third year recovery seems it's reasonable
 forecast. think argue pieces but, least
 part country, find mood upbeat sense around
 table. long list things could go wrong;
 one them, certainly, could go wrong 1985 could end
 disastrous year. seems me, you're betting person,
 outlook really pretty good; don't see anything wrong
 accepting pretty good outlook comes way. Clearly,
 
 2/12-13/85
 
 -18-
 
 risks dollar problems agriculture
 areas risk. whole think maybe
 Federal Reserve ought surprise country feel bad
 outlook 1985. So, would inclined take
 forecast less is, acknowledge things could go
 wrong, still present upbeat kind outlook.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Miss Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. First, terms inflation outlook, came
 3-1/2 percent without taking account value
 dollar; Ted Truman convinced dollar going
 depreciate eventually rounded number 4 percent.
 assumed going direction, would rounded
 3 percent whole numbers; don't
 confidence finely that.
 terms productivity--and something I'm interested
 in--one factor think we're soft peddling, ignoring,
 whole productivity discussion simply commitment business
 managers productive. deal kinds
 people Si Keehn Rust Belt viewing
 high priority item. It's shape you're going
 dead; it's simple that. Therefore, given
 strong incentive productive. understand that,
 unfortunately, doesn't fit well econometric models,
 doesn't mean isn't factor doesn't mean isn't
 important factor. Furthermore, think notion ties
 we're seeing plant equipment spending: order
 get kinds productivity gains feel
 compete imports, bring state-of-the-art
 equipment. saw plant Friday robots
 place $90,000 per unit. It's small investment
 improve productivity. think we're going see
 even offices; maybe Washington,
 parts country productive.
 use word processors; stretch
 clerical help giving better tools. think pay
 attention because, Jim said, important
 respect inflation possibilities also growth potential.
 Finally, [I concerned about] continuing strong dollar,
 agricultural problem Si already referred to, third
 world debt situation--I went meeting last week State
 Department latter doesn't seem
 problem gone away--and thrifts, still hanging
 edge cliff. Looking four factors,
 find difficult think terms interest rates going
 higher all, think would push problems
 still serious mode. heaven knows bad enough!
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Well, agree Ed Boehne so.
 think staff projecting smaller real growth 1985
 we're going realize. put 4 percent number think
 that's minimum; really think we'll probably better
 real growth. It's hard document position well
 basis numbers come since last meeting
 
 2/12-13/85

 fairly mixed bag. one thing impressed
 past weeks extraordinary strength
 stock market.
 Since 9th January stock market put

 So, seems problems 1985
 going problems strong economy going
 difficult deal with, perhaps so,
 problems would face economy came weaker.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, we're fairly close agreement
 staff forecast 1985 couple different
 assumptions. One [keyed] midpoint M1
 [objective] projected 5-1/2 percent M1 growth rather
 6-1/2 percent staff has, still came essentially
 numbers exception deflator; would
 somewhere range 1/2 percent higher deflator.
 higher deflator number fell unit labor cost component
 forecast, suggesting unit labor costs would go
 staff forecast. respects, would seem
 we're going get somewhat greater growth staff
 forecasting first half year somewhat less
 second half, largely interest rate pressures
 brought bear greater growth [in first half]
 maybe action Federal Reserve move that.
 would also want note Committee, follow-up
 comment Si Keehn, condition agricultural

 may national impact, much suggested,

 would also want note quickly, talked Farm Credit

 So, it's hard
 judge level is. don't believe it's quite

 easy; isn't. thinking maybe $20

 MR. BOYKIN. No. think it's becoming

 Overall, looking situation today, would certainly go forward
 great big smile face keep fingers crossed
 kept going.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, didn't comment general
 situation earlier let briefly now, may. First
 all, agree staff forecast; came very, close
 it. minor difference would note that, like others,
 shape 1985 looks little different us staff:
 think greater growth first half
 second. generally speaking, reasonable forecast it's
 one would prepared accept one would
 prepared base policy on.
 talking people around District, sense
 confidence level high; good deal optimism
 economy. private forecasters seem coming pretty
 much way growth inflation. I, too, came
 meeting feeling pretty good; unlike colleagues, I'm
 particularly disturbed I'm hearing think
 problems real. potential problems think
 keep clearly mind--not they're necessarily
 going happen, think would [ignore] problems
 peril. think real. beginning feel talking
 people sense euphoria beginning develop.
 And, least small sample, people aren't even talking much
 deficit anymore. 1984 very, good
 year phenomenal growth; looking good growth 1985;
 problems dollar, deficit, oil prices,
 agriculture seem diminishing people's minds. So, think
 careful keep problems much mind.
 comment would make I'm sure
 agricultural situation really parochial one macro
 one. District, we're talking
 
 -21-

 Midwest Southeast perhaps Southwest.
 banks might affected small, aggregate dislocation
 among agricultural banks could substantial. Again, I'm
 optimistic, think dangers keep

 We'll take it.

 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think staff's projection
 certainly plausible can't quarrel much it. believe,
 like Frank Morris Ed Boehne Bob Boykin, risk

 forecast assumption income velocity M1

 seems low side likely happen.

 unusual, even third year economic expansion.

 people suggest--then kind result could occur even

 think need move top end, reflect actually

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Anybody else comments?
 
 MS. HORN. Mr. Chairman, also support alternative II
 4 7 percent range M1.
 may reasons--Chuck Pres
 talked them--why M1 indeed probably would come
 toward top part range. Nonetheless, uncertainties
 face--[the age of] recovery, velocity, exchange rates,
 forth--I'd like see discussion presentation

 refer top half range, I'd favor discussion

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 we're really saying we've done job inflation we're
 willing accept inflation roughly 4 percent level perhaps

 doesn't, done past, talk upper

 would emphasize looking growth near
 midpoint, I'd willing go upper part range
 providing velocity doesn't perform projecting. result,
 seems ranges accommodate we're looking for.
 would like top 7 percent, therefore providing
 restraint event projections don't come through.
 Lastly, I'm concerned M3 credit; ranges,
 whatever may be, perfectly right me.
 M1 M2
 would prefer alternative II.
