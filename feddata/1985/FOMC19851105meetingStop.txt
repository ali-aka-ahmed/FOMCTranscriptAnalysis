 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. MELZER.
 
 Comments?
 
 Jim, kind shape inventories
 
 general?
 MR. KICHLINE. think really quite good. Obviously, part
 going aggregate numbers auto story:
 stocks run substantially third quarter
 rebuilt now. go various sectors, putting
 together know, think inventories line
 aggregate, forecast rising
 sales.
 don't really run don't
 contribute growth; they're neutral factor. couple
 areas think important.
 seen figures Sears,
 example, presumably pretty close industry
 planning. still feel inventories little high
 side, banking decent Christmas spending, expect
 take care it.
 indeed consumer spending turned
 little weak, would think retailers might happy
 enter new year.
 Still, general merchandise area,
 particularly respect apparel soft goods, depends
 decent sales prospects coming along.
 MR. PARTEE.
 Jim, extraordinarily low saving rate
 third quarter.
 Would attribute mainly surge
 car sales credit associated it, what?
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, two things: one surge
 car sales; income growth weakening consumer
 spending outside autos still pretty good--not weak.
 want take percentage point auto sales,
 might that.
 even so, looking fairly
 good consumer spending weakening real disposable income growth,
 consumers really position reducing saving
 rate, borrowing lot forth, fund expenditures.
 So, think
 autos.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. calculation point
 kind interesting.
 entirely valid calculation
 can't hold everything else equal, limitation
 valid calculation.
 use benchmark of, say, 5 6
 percent average preceding quarters work that,
 combination two things--the reduction farm income higher
 net interest payments consumers--appears worth little
 percentage point saving rate itself.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Higher net interest payments?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 things.
 
 Net.
 
 Oh, net interest;
 
 so, payments minus receipts.

 mentioned before--there $250 million building coming

 curve right; going come stream right time.
 inclined agree Pres terms outlook 3 5 years

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, Sixth District seeing
 definite tapering economic activity. Unemployment
 somewhat. sectors suffering last
 several months still difficulty, basically textiles
 apparel. Agriculture, bad Midwest, still
 doldrums, energy pretty bad. hand,
 continuing activity commercial real estate sector,
 find very, difficult understand. get answer
 people get: They're going continue build long
 money it; guess that's way developers usually
 think. seem somewhat irrational think
 going pay price along way. Housing,
 hand, fairly decent Sixth District.
 statistical information shows downturn, must say
 attitude directors business people talked fairly
 optimistic. Again, find little difficult understand
 optimism coming from. Even New Orleans Louisiana
 generally, really pits were, seem fairly
 sanguine situation looking uptick
 activity.
 Going national scene, don't strong
 disagreement staff; think right. think
 Jim quite right put warning signals,
 particularly respect consumer. Housing definitely
 something that, continues, going source strength
 economy. really isn't much else one point
 near future that's going positive force. I'm little
 concerned housing may strong forecast.
 hand, don't really see we're going
 appreciable decline activity. So, think staff's forecast
 right. add--and meant note District
 report--that people talking beginning see price
 pressures building businesses. say it's related
 
 11/4-5/85
 
 value dollar, surprises bit, would
 suggest effect occurring little faster would
 expected. definitely reporting increase

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 is?
 
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 "They" basically textiles--shirt
 manufacturers people like that. raw material increasing
 price.
 MR. MORRIS. chances, Jim, you're
 conservative net exports side?
 don't show net exports
 drag anymore but, certainly, we're seeing significant
 response fairly sizable decline dollar taken
 place.
 Now, normal--?
 MR. KICHLINE. think built
 fairly normal historical response.
 I'll let Ted answer. might say
 question catches little surprise usual
 question get is: net exports rising?
 So, haven't
 thought one recently.
 MR. TRUMAN. think that's right answer; that's
 reaction well. increase. fact percentage
 change export side increase 7 percent real
 terms goods services 9 percent goods alone.
 import side essentially flat small decline--less
 percent imports goods small increase services,
 would depend debt.
 it's basically line
 tended say--this question price
 question side.
 don't think prices going
 change much people argue, import prices aren't going
 reflect quickly fully past exchange rate
 changes.
 also follows shouldn't get response
 exchange rate changes fully fast past.
 two
 things sometimes linked together. tended little toward
 conservative side prices various reasons, least
 short run.
 know underway, feel shouldn't put
 large number forecast. Therefore, also don't large
 number other, [real, side]; it's somewhat attenuated.
 think it's far believe historical experience,
 given quality information trade data point,
 good.
 MR. KICHLINE. might say net export sector
 contributes half percent growth next year. So, would
 essentially 2 percent real growth fourth-to-fourth quarter
 held net exports constant. That's impact numbers Ted
 talking about.
 MR. MORRIS. gradual depreciation path, point
 expect get real upward kick net exports?
 Obviously,
 it's 1986.
 MR. TRUMAN.

 Well, think that's pretty big kick:

 11/4-5/85
 
 -10-
 
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, get kick early service
 receipts reevaluation current quarter. looking
 ahead, think begins kick end
 1986; presumably 1987 important year it's beyond
 forecast horizon. it's late '86 best see
 particular strength see carrying on.
 MR. TRUMAN. That's essentially delayed reaction
 steep decline gradual move.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, wonder might ask Jim
 couple questions.
 Jim, made passing reference
 introduction IBM's new Sierra mainframe computers.
 struck
 weekly publication Citicorp day estimated
 400 500 already order delivered fourth quarter.
 would cause pretty sizeable increase total producer durable

 equipment expenditures; seemed huge me, looking it.

 wondered made estimate might do.
 second thing I'd taken encouragement nonfarm
 payroll employment figure suggested ought averaged
 September, understood correctly. think
 seasonal adjustment problem what?
 Let comment employment figures
 MR. KICHLINE. Yes.
 first. problem occurs particularly manufacturing
 construction. manufacturing, employment dropped 110,000
 September, really didn't believe; rose 60,000
 October, don't believe either. neither BLS.
 couple things going on.
 One survey week
 October earliest possible could occurred.
 seasonals thinking terms declining employment October,
 thought survey week early didn't pick
 decline; hence, seasonally adjusted, get larger
 increase. Now, that's one part, particularly manufacturing.
 evidence terms physical product
 information leads us think distortions.
 would still say it's good number clear
 two months together look better earlier year.
 regard Sierra, seen [shipments] numbers
 range impact $3 $10 billion annual rate
 fourth quarter. talked IBM talked others.
 

 trying build dismal year IBM's earnings
 expectations make fourth quarter, best
 can.
 manufacturers,
 one, well all.

 think offsets occurring there.
 addition, fourth
 quarter expect sharp decline business purchases autos
 since autos sold third quarter business
 purchases cut-rate terms.
 Sierra effect little

 uncertain.
 thinking picked low-end number used
 positive $4 billion annual rate attributable that, largely offset
 autos extent truck sales, think down.
 say, numbers
 we're wrong--.
 big impact.
 outside [forecasters using] range $3 billion $10 billion
 annual rate depends part assume happening
 elsewhere computer industry.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 also partly offset declining shipments
 
 others.
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 That's right, yes.
 
 MR. BLACK. must done Citicorp report,
 clear me, look gross effect.
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. BLACK. surprisingly large; wish could
 ought remember it,
 remember percentage shook me.
 senility overtaken can't.
 MR. PARTEE.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 need computer!
 may old that!
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. really little report way
 change District since last meeting. businesses
 showing strength continue reasonably well.
 certainly noticeable improvement beleaguered.
 steel industry lines mechanical equipment remain
 awfully weak. steel side, import restraints
 effect far perfect. pricing conditions
 industry intense. Agriculture, think, speaks
 itself. harvests late wet weather.
 Nonetheless, crop estimates increased bit,
 pressure continue commodity prices. positively--we've
 commented construction industry--certainly commercial
 construction Chicago strong.
 saw presentation
 day showing Chicago going building period
 unsurpassed since great fire. awful lot buildings
 going up.
 add comment Jim said earlier,
 auto inventories really low; finished big
 sales program 24 26 days' [supply],
 lowest inventory level 20 years.
 So, rest
 quarter going January, one manufacturer least going
 running absolutely flat including maximum overtime
 schedule. running plants absolute maximum
 least January. outlook '86 regard car
 sales pretty good--a bit lower nonetheless recent
 sales program hasn't big impact '86 volume one
 might expected. balance, look conditions
 District, staff forecast would rather consistent way
 see it.
 
 11/4-5/85

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 sales yet we?
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 haven't last 10 days' auto
 
 No, comes afternoon.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. pick Bob Forrestal said, heard
 thing major retailer St. Louis: Far
 East Japanese others already beginning jack prices
 apparel textile goods. One thing I've noticed
 talking people around District seems
 interest developing bidding farm land. People talked
 sense serious
 expression interest, along lines Ed Boehne saying
 terms equipment, putting together groups bid land,
 think constructive development.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 first I've heard.
 
 MR. MELZER. That's low prices. would
 Arkansas northern Mississippi I'd say prices probably
 40 50 percent highs.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, one hand, appears
 spillover effects agricultural problem District
 growing sense recent gains employment District
 states, extent occurred all, sluggish.
 Unemployment rates District states increase.
 hand, get away agricultural sector,
 tone anecdotal comments I've hearing
 situation isn't great isn't bad either. take
 roughly consistent kind forecast reflected
 Greenbook. think Greenbook forecast largely consistent
 incoming evidence we've seeing terms
 employment discussed, strength final demand, relatively
 acceptable levels inventories, forth. guess it's fair
 say ongoing construction boom Twin Cities.
 Minneapolis St. Paul vacancy rates rising,
 although haven't kept Sun Belt, don't look
 bad relative national numbers. Developers
 I've talked give roughly explanation you've heard:
 basically it's equity play financial institutions feel
 missed late '70s early '80s don't want miss
 next opportunity. Finally, disappointed, date
 anyway, performance housing. least terms level
 starts, first half came somewhat stronger
 expected. fact last months weaker doesn't
 really surprise me. don't think we're good timing
 things precisely suspect maybe bit better
 first half, we're going little worse. But, net,
 don't see reason think anything terribly unusual going
 far relationship rates housing activity.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 11/4-5/85
 
 -13-
 
 MR. BALLES. Twelfth District, there's combination
 good news bad news long time.
 areas weak continue weak
 traditional ones talked many times: forest
 products, agriculture, oil. recently, somewhat
 consternation, electronics industry something
 slump, least time being. hand,
 considerable strength defense spending kinds
 companies benefit that. suspect receiving
 end unusually big share West. staff tells
 two states taken together, California Washington,
 28 percent defense contracts, that's obviously strong
 plus terms tone business, least two states.
 Retail trade figures seem going well; stores
 reporting year-over-year sales gains 5 10 percent. Auto sales
 going well states. course service
 industries, nearly identifiable anything like
 steel whatever, reporting pretty good news terms
 performance. staff reports market single-family
 housing appears relatively healthy, pleased see.
 Whether it's permits, sales, prices, seem holding
 markets, although differs quite bit one moves state
 state. nine states, generalization
 appear area great weakness moment.
 terms outlook, view much different
 Board staff's respect balance year. staff
 little optimistic look 1986, simply sense
 expect somewhat greater shrinkage net imports--that
 won't big drag economy 1985.
 course, judgmental difference, think ought get
 little kick improvement foreign trade
 position coming expected decline value dollar.
 That's thumb-nail sketch West.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. John, don't know whether
 ask Bob Forrestal, know Boeing expecting great
 things, particularly export side, new model 747
 beginning market?
 MR. BALLES.
 
 mean 757?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 highly fuel efficient 747.
 
 No, new model,
 
 MR. BALLES. Gee, Jerry, familiar is,
 unless it's 747 SP.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. BALLES.
 
 No, no, it's new generation of--
 
 haven't heard sorry say.
 
 MR. STERN. Northwest ordered bunch them--I don't
 remember many--as part $2 billion capital spending program
 initiated. that's know it.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 know anything it, Jim?

 11/4-5/85
 
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 No, don't.
 
 I'm sorry.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. assuming budgetary
 projections farm bill?
 MR. KICHLINE. $45 billion deficit reduction
 package next year. That's $8 billion less
 Congressional estimates. expected $53 billion fiscal
 1986.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 real?
 
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, trying tell
 didn't accept $53 billion figure. think overruns
 number areas. farm area prime one; don't
 specific number farm bill, think going
 come higher Congress expected.
 that's
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] pretty optimistic-[unintelligible]. lower prices forecast?
 
 MR. KICHLINE. lower them?
 much, couple tenths.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER MR. MARTIN.
 MR> KICHLINE.
 
 reduced
 
 One half percent.
 
 price measure looking at--the
 
 deflator?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm looking them--gross
 domestic business product deflator.
 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 right.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 That's .4 down.
 
 Excluding food energy.
 
 MR. KICHLINE. couple reasons: One incoming
 information couple areas little better
 thought third quarter. That's case gross business
 product deflator. compensation wages, went
 continues look really quite good us, indeed
 maybe little better. weakness economic activity,
 little slack labor product markets
 before. addition, taking another look
 import prices, felt perhaps reason say
 come along little slower--that is, rising prices dollar
 would occur later year--so pushed back bit.
 things together add .4 index.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. two comments. One involves housing
 comment tightening terms lending standards
 going get prevalent. haven't seen
 much yet statistics doesn't mean won't show
