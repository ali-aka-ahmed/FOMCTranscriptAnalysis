 MR. KICHLINE.

 question
 
 Ted?
 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Well, made presentation.
 
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, two parts really
 important. clearly much slower growth final sales;
 instead numbers 5 percent area, talking numbers
 much less that--something 2-1/2 percent area.
 talking substantial slowing. going happen
 environment us get 3 percent growth essentially
 inventories negative--that basically small
 contributor--and deterioration trade balance comes
 halt pretty quickly. Ted, maybe want talk little
 numbers. Maybe not!
 MR. TRUMAN. Maybe not! One contributing factor clearly
 going less demand here. certainly
 one factor slowing rate increase imports. also
 true rest world, booming, growing
 somewhat faster will. feel export level
 depressed, perhaps somewhat artificially, second quarter
 pick some. think put relatively

 it--trajectory non-oil imports. imports real terms

 pessimistic believe phenomenon going increase

 much which--basically projection period--is ahead
 us.
 clear considerable uncertainty
 numbers, Jim indicated indicated before,
 among things bouncing around quite lot.

 certainly wouldn't rule possibility imports particular

 imports real terms continuing rise marginally

 also true rise

 MR. PARTEE.
 
 ordinarily would expect quite lag.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, get quantity effects begin

 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Within quarter?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, again, go four quarters

 MR. PARTEE.
 might ask another question: Jim,
 make fairly pervasive weakness nonresidential indicators

 fact long construction lead time.

 something think collapse.
 problem area
 
 8/20/85
 
 indicators activity--even industrial buildings,
 public utilities forth--give us sense basically
 weakening. So, forecast small declines;
 could larger depending assumptions one wants make.
 throughout forecast period small declines. Now,
 would note data volatile;

 MR. BOEHNE. main case getting 3 percent

 pointed out: consumer side single-family housing.
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, don't feel quite nervous
 personal consumption expenditures moment suggest,
 income right--if generating enough income sectors-because think basically fairly mild expectations

 saving rate, income growth tracking along, really
 bullish environment. point negatives, debt
 side certainly one.
 Income growth, think, little risky;
 lot income growth generated don't
 much happening sectors lead slower growth.
 So, don't view big risk really much
 slower pace consumer spending store.
 housing area one may lags wrong.
 thinking back, said time ago seen drop
 couple percentage points mortgage interest rates and, given
 lags, ought seeing pickup. haven't.

 think would abandon story time August numbers

 come [and don't show pickup], think conclude

 important. put forecast together today,
 would lower housing start number little lower residential

 data came put forecast together

 MR. MARTIN. Jim, let address Ed's question little
 different way. don't problems said.

 isn't true that, housing market matured,
 shift direction fixed rate mortgage originations away
 adjustable rate mortgage originations?
 go back
 months take spike fixed mortgage rate, really
 decrease 100 150 basis points rate; shift
 go along line then,
 using fixed rate loans.
 tightening credit underwriting offset 100 150 points;
 can't offset 200 300 points, probably. Perhaps
 much improvement point sale fixed rate mortgage,
 [given] appreciation house looked for.
 So,
 complicate further-MR. BOEHNE.
 
 know much market, Pres.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Yesterday reading--I think number us

 MR. BALLES.
 Jim, budget resolution

 How, all, would change forecast result
 Congressional action?
 MR. KICHLINE. differences earlier assumptions
 really quite small. assumed package $50

 [difference the]
 
 economic assumptions less
 
 also felt many actions require
 
 single-year appropriations bills addressing
 year-in year-out. clearly pressures farm
 area overrun targets.
 phony things,
 
 stripping away phony things.
 
 really take persistent
 
 action.
 So, near term fairly close; think
 would much less optimistic year two year three.

 
 gone explicit process, course CBO
