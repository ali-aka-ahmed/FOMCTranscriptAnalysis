 MS. SEGER. think NABE forecast

 MR. KICHLINE. Well, guess it's somewhat fortunate

 think, terms trying look late '86 '87.

 Ted sense dollar forecast giving us help--is
 go '86, dollar follows path we've
 assumed, ought getting benefits domestically
 terms increased production.
 So, moment wouldn't
 necessarily come bearish forecast assume
 economy comes grinding halt late '86 early '87.
 Certainly, forecast would give one sense
 begin Q1 1987 fall cliff; sense
 economy growing 2-1/2 3 percent area pretty much throughout
 period, helped foreign trade sector later
 1986.
 MR. BALLES. May follow dollar outlook question
 that's key one?
 understand numbers
 correctly, expectation dollar another 8
 percent end '86.
 It's already 12 percent

 MR. TRUMAN. Another way looking it, Jim said,

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I'd like make two comments.
 One seeing, really since beginning
 year, divergence growth rate M1 growth rates
 broader aggregates. look total liquid assets,
 debt, M3, even M2, you'll see deceleration growth rates since
 early year. M1 one chart show
 accelerating. wonder would look back earlier history,
 Steve, find periods kind divergence
 past. don't think many, actually. given
 divergence, weight apply M1?
 MR. AXILROD. That's exercise engaged in, actually.
 three-quarter period acceleration--these
 accelerations levels growth rates--in M1 occurred
 third quarter year; it's acceleration 9
 percentage points, essentially, annual rate. time
 nontransactions component M2 decelerated 3 points.
 M2 measured period [decelerated] two
 tenths; certainly accelerated. Now, looked back,
 period exception sense back first
 quarter 1966. nontransactions component dropped 1 percent
 M2 went 1 percent--small increases relative M1,
 gone 4-1/2 percent. periods
 similar drops nontransactions component small increases
 M2. couple money nominal GNP went together.
 large M1 strong nominal GNP
 correspondingly strong, M2 also relatively strong.
 thing make getting shifts
 M1 nontransactions component M2, doesn't
 affect M2 whole affect M1. case, M2 might
 given weight conflict two;
 tending say nominal GNP isn't going move quite much.
 simplistic formula would M1 strong M2 strong,
 odds better nominal GNP going go
 conflicts two [aggregates].
 think that's--
 
 10/1/85
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 didn't look beyond M2?
 
 MR. AXILROD. Well, whole list variables here,

 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, 40.
 [The specific number] doesn't matter;
 basically, it's large decline short period time.
 looked economy would three years later-another 18 months decline happened. looked two

 Capacity utilization might believe:

 MR. STERN. based radical assumption

 MR. AXILROD. Well, could add one example

 Mr. Cross Mr. Truman [may think differently]--that market

 [Coffee break]
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. think discussion [about exchange

 sharpen dilemmas bit, funds rate last couple

 Ordinarily, would think [rise] would strengthening

 MR. PARTEE. That's surprising. September growth
