 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Ms. Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. want thank Chairman visiting
 people talking last six

 basically concerns involve strong dollar--the surge

 made don't quickly reverse course. dollar could take

 move back. So, think longer goes serious
 consequences. don't think take lightly.
 Another thing I'd like mention involves see
 risks staff forecast. cynic looking consumer spending,
 see besides lot spending going imports lot

 like that. auto industry, particularly, special

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. mentioned earlier, think lot
 economic success we've enjoyed last year half

 last half 1983 came target
 came pretty closely target 1984.
 If, next
 meeting, becomes apparent markets aimed
 point "B" "A," well upper band,
 think that's going lead people assume we've thrown
 towel inflation.
 I'd disturbed aiming
 point upper band. Roger suggested--and Steve others
 made point--if get point, make
 pretty wrenching effort get back targets involves
 obvious risks.
 So, Steve stated well, think little move
 might go long way; would come preferring path
 something like "C."
 could live something little higher

 MR. STERN. would generally favor specifications "B"

 Nevertheless, one modification would suggest--and might
 nature splitting hairs--is reducing [March June] M1

 think might
 couple things us.
 One extent long-run
 targets agreed last meeting appropriate,
 seems makes second half year little easier.
 That's one reason it. fundamentally
 importantly mind, given view economic outlook, think

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES. Well, Mr. Chairman, think case

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. would generally associate
 alternative B but, reasons Mr. Stern mentioned
 one other, would favor M1 target 6 percent--6, 7,
 addition
 8 percent [respectively M1, M2, M3].
 reasons Gary stated, think potentially bit
 public relations problem 6-1/2 percent--and really
 splitting hairs--puts target quarter parallel
 line. background others us
 saying there's "change policy" would communicate it,
 think aiming something would hair parallel
 line point susceptible interpretation change
 policy. So, would like see 6 percent substantive
 reasons mentioned also would kiss
 parallel line.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Gramley.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY.
 I'm concerned, many are, long
 run--that is, next 5 years so--we inflation
 problem probably going get worse dollar begins
 fall, less money growth better more. So, would
 prefer see growth M1 come lower 6-1/2 percent;
 wouldn't want anything force that. like Ed's
 
 3/26/85
 
 -33-
 
 prescription prayer better Si Keehn's raising borrowing
 level $500 $600 million. may midyear
 regret this. don't think one assume that, simply
 money might upper edge parallel line--maybe even
 close enough contact intimate kiss--at point. think
 decide later; wait see economic
 conditions look like time. Six percent might make sense,
 cosmetically, M1 target March June. worry
 about, however, get speed-up tax refunds, might
 increase money growth reason, really
 wouldn't make significant difference course economic
 activity. I'd like adopt course policy
 keeps us really are. don't want see fed funds rate
 go 9 percent don't want see go back 8
 percent. would like see hover range 8-1/2 8-3/4
 percent, even 8-5/8 percent,
 recently. hunch maybe need little higher level
 initial borrowing $350 million--maybe $400 million somewhere
 around there. sense prescription would stay
 pretty steady time.
 MR. MORRIS.

 borrowing target really target isn't it? sit

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, number that's used

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, isn't exactly understanding.
 think tried explain memo couple meetings ago.
 MR. AXILROD. It's hard control distribution

 Since bias toward continuing make sure don't

 given

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Partee.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, rather like Lyle said.
 think,
 cosmetically, would desirable put 6 percent M1

 now, think notion growth would running pretty

 think
 maybe borrowings number could snugged $400 million,

 I'm wondering times--and think are--when

 since agree could pretty destructive

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. PARTEE.
 Yes. Maybe ought lower rate

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. PARTEE.
 
 Right.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's wonderful 6, 7, 8 percent,

 borrowings discernible effect do,
 differences opinion. bias would lower side
 that. hypothesizing might do, it's easy
 money runs low; runs high, I'd want know running

 Well, that's point.

 -38-
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, $500 $600 million going put
 funds rate upward pressure isn't it? didn't get answer.
 MR. RICE.
 
 That's says here.
 
 MR. AXILROD. It's hard answer, would say
 would use whatever borrowing assumption Committee arrives
 construct path make excess reserves assumption.
 Let's say it's little higher $600 million--suppose $650
 million. use excess reserves assumption matter
 level borrowing Committee arrives at. So, Committee
 arrives level borrowing $500 million we're assuming
 excess reserves $650 million, mind, would tighter
 reserve position previous period, comparing
 say, $350 $400 million $650 million. probably would
 lead funds rate somewhere 8-1/2 percent, maybe 8-3/4
 percent rather one possibly 8-1/2 percent maybe 8-3/8
 8-1/2 percent, rough guess relation alternative B.
 Mr. Sternlight may somewhat different view.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 No, think would be--
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, maybe ought
 agreement net borrowings rather borrowings.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm sure that. No,
 think would mistake, might get demand
 excess reserves. set net borrowing target, that's putting
 pressure market; think that's effect happened
 last time. think would getting results

 share Roger's concern.
 would rather market say: "There

 So,
 appears economy going recession."
 
 Roger right, I'd rather see $450 million.
 
 I'm sure.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, market looks excess reserves too.
 borrowing fluctuates excess fluctuates too,
 seems put together.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Whatever number put here, think
 one pretty sure excess reserves really jumped
 week, way would work borrowings probably would
 jump too. would cautious them, probably,
 been. There's little peculiarity record: last time
 said [in directive] didn't change, didn't
 much change. looked borrowings, looks like
 tightened up. say we're [not] going change time
 go down, looks like opposite.
 MR. AXILROD. Borrowings thus far week, week
 we're going publish--the week, two weeks--in
 recent Fed statements running close $400 million,
 whatever [that's worth].
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Taking account noise,
 particularly one two-week period $1-1/2 billion
 borrowing [by one] institution, don't think markets would sense
 we're far away $400 million right would they,
 Peter?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. probably would guess aimed
 something like $400 $500 million, think dismissed
 $600 million plus one two-week period.
 probably would thinking $400 $500 million.
 MR. BLACK.
 
 Well, shouldn't consider using
 
 figure?
 MR. RICE. $350 million. That's [unintelligible]
 might get something average lot higher, like now.
 $350 million.
 MR. GRAMLEY. think start borrowing $350
 $500 million, ought provide lot flexibility exactly
 that's interpreted, depending demand excess reserves
 on. that's certainly wide range borrowing
 unreasonable.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. GRAMLEY.
 
 say--$350 $500 million?
 
 $350 $500 million.
 
 -41-
 
 3/26/85
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 Yes, know.
 
 MR. GRAMLEY.
 
 I'm responding Bob Black's
 
 suggestion maybe ought start $400 $500 million
 instead $350 $400 million that's really
 
 according Peter Sternlight. So, say let's reasonable:
 let's start $350 $500 million working range; that's
 presumably one might able live with.
 MR. KEEHN.
 
 would think $350 $500 million would
 
 good compromise difference.
 MR. GUFFEY.
 
 assume path would built upon
 
 $425 million level.
 
 MR. AXILROD. Well, Governor Gramley,
 terms borrowing; it's terms implied free

 shade tighter we've aiming be,
 free reserves way, shade tighter.
