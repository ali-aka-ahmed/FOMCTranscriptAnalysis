 mr. morri.
 
 mr. morri. mr. chairman, i'd like make two comment.
 on see, realli sinc begin
 year, diverg growth rate m1 growth rate
 broader aggreg. look total liquid asset,
 debt, m3, even m2, you'll see deceler growth rate sinc
 earli year. m1 on chart show
 acceler. wonder would look back earlier histori,
 steve, find period kind diverg
 past. don't think mani, actual. given
 diverg, weight appli m1?
 mr. axilrod. that's exercis engag in, actual.
 three-quarter period acceler--these
 acceler level growth rate--in m1 occur
 third quarter year; it's acceler 9
 percentag point, essenti, annual rate. time
 nontransact compon m2 deceler 3 point.
 m2 measur period [deceler] two
 tenth; certainli acceler. now, look back,
 period except sens back first
 quarter 1966. nontransact compon drop 1 percent
 m2 went 1 percent--small increas rel m1,
 gone 4-1/2 percent. period
 similar drop nontransact compon small increas
 m2. coupl monei nomin gnp went togeth.
 larg m1 strong nomin gnp
 correspondingli strong, m2 also rel strong.
 thing make get shift
 m1 nontransact compon m2, doesn't
 affect m2 whole affect m1. case, m2 might
 given weight conflict two;
 tend sai nomin gnp isn't go move quit much.
 simplist formula would m1 strong m2 strong,
 odd better nomin gnp go go
 conflict two [aggreg].
 think that's--
 
 10/1/85
 
 chairman volcker.
 
 didn't look beyond m2?
 
 mr. axilrod. well, whole list variabl here,
 like rate chang commod price, dollar. none
