 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 We're comment period.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, travelling around
 District usual spring talking lots people
 different kinds businesses.
 little hard summarize
 situation great variability among industries.
 general, find people saying: "Well, things
 aren't great, aren't terrible either."
 District
 seems changing economic mix toward faster
 growing sectors away traditional manufacturing area. So,
 general, think tone probably little better
 District might others.
 One thing strike me, talking lots
 people, expectations economic outlook seem
 rather precarious zone right now. Earlier, around start
 recovery expectations generally expansion, get
 bearish statistic, greeted aberration doesn't
 really much effect expectations. get
 recession way around: Everyone thinks things
 going downhill get bullish statistic, viewed
 aberration. kind bombardment mixed signals
 getting, think period expectations could
 change rather rapidly.
 Right think predominant view
 
 5/21/85
 
 still economy going continue expand;
 enough [negative] reports coming in, people shift over.
 almost like teeter totter weight opinion could
 shift toward side. story somebody told
 person runs medium size capital goods firm,
 illustrates this.
 family business, told still expect good second
 half, makes nervous salesmen, instead buying
 cars boats, buying CDs insured institutions.
 So, think
 gives great deal pause might happen.
 gray area expectations could change rather
 rapidly.
 inflation front, don't sense great concern
 inflation. people spoke talking fairly
 moderate wage increases.
 find difficult pass price
 increases find prices suppliers
 holding fairly steady. So, whatever statistics coming in,
 don't find much inflation side. influence

 So, look
 what's going District around country, think

 share view
 experiencing already--and likely see year

 Like Si, recently meeting council small

 Contrary
 conditions District, Si, yours, Roger, family
 farm still predominates, know West large scale
 farm predominates.
 even representatives agribusinesses singing blues gave pretty graphic
 illustrations bad business was, high
 interest rates also strong dollar.
 Cotton one major
 products agriculture California traditionally 80
 percent exported.
 imagine high dollar
 done cotton exports; particular business big
 trouble.
 Based latest information have, nearly
 nine states District experienced increase unemployment
 fractionally; latest month data total
 employment, actually dropped bit.
 Electronics,
 one stronger growth industries years flat;
 manufacturing rather weak except defense spending;
 lumber still disaster.
 Aerospace one industry still going
 fairly strong.
 balance, adding strong weak areas,
 clear weaknesses predominate seeing
 West seeing national statistics: pretty

 sluggish performance. Therefore, get around policy
 discussion, would reason would like err,
 going err all, side ease.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, long since abandoned
 hope anybody well projecting economic outlook
 extended period time. particularly uncomfortable
 trying today signals mixed.
 said that, guess would staff forecast wrong,
 may tad bit low side. see it, domestic demand
 still pretty strong sharp growth M1 back winter
 likely keep fairly strong. real question is: What's going
 happen imports? don't think know answer that.
 agree staff's assessment dollar probably
 peaked continue down. felt
 slowing rate increase imports, don't know; may
 1986 Mike suggested. thinking probably would see
 effects then. event, think last half
 year GNP might somewhere around 3.3 percent growth
 staff projecting last half year.
 implicit assumption velocity staff
 made, kind growth M1 seem talking
 about--say, 6-1/2 percent fourth quarter last year
 fourth quarter year--that implies slight decline M1
 velocity. get rapid rate growth Ml, would
 course mean that, would unusual
 stage business expansion. certainly wouldn't say can't
 happen, don't think likely. short, don't
 believe general economic outlook provides compelling
 reasons point significant move toward ease.
 tempting think terms ease, see worries
 Pres outlined. point really would
 exacerbate problems. excessively easy policy,
 coupled things, think created
 past. time, even though statistics seem
 flashing danger signals, keep eye long-run objective.
 would try keep aggregates control; specifically,
 mind trying get M1 back somewhere within target bands
 set ourselves.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. want applaud Board reducing
 discount rate, although timing found little surprising. But-MR. GRAMLEY.
 
 can't win!
 
 MR. MORRIS. think [unintelligible] economy

 know whether confined New England area would like

 Everybody

 MR. MORRIS. beginning plan now.
 That's difference.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Rice.
 
 MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, think major concern
 whether economy going rebound moderately second half
 projected staff forecast whether going continue
 along present sluggish path. Now, one convinced
 economy going perform along lines forecast
 second half, don't think need worry much; worry
 would next year. think staff forecast probably
 captures likely outcome, factors supporting outlook
 seem strong. probably expect
 continued strength residential construction, rate growth
 business fixed investment consumption expenditures
 declining. Yet, 3 3-1/2 percent growth look depends
 moderate strength categories. So,
 hard confident basic strength spending
 that's going produce outcome. resource utilization
 significantly capacity, capacity utilization recently
 falling--and even stabilizes point on, still
 relatively low level--and outlook unemployment
 reassuring declining significantly,
 seems economy vulnerable side.
 seems little risk excessive growth
 circumstances. So, would say reasonably expect
 economy is, Governor Martin put it, vulnerable.
 could go either way; see strong momentum either direction.
 think inflation outlook moderate.
 recent influences inflation rate probably temporary;
 convinced recent spike wage costs
 temporary. would say, therefore, inflation outlook
 moderate satisfied anything less 3
 3-1/2 percent rate growth second half. think
 make policy judgments particular bias mind.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Corrigan.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, looking economy
 first taking little longer perspective it, think

 numbers would suggest domestic final demand really
 performing less expected third year recovery
 maybe even little better expected. wild card,
 amply reflected far discussion, insofar GNP
 production, etc., external side. backdrop,
 still lean view balance year real GNP

 recent rather pronounced decline interest rates provides
 little measure insurance direction.
 time, kind forecast one assumes much smaller drag
 coming external sector balance year.
 economists seem pretty comfortable group that,
 darned find businessman--whether small large
 business--who agrees that. think remains, therefore,
 wild card.
 agree say nonresidential sector-the construction sector particular--looks vulnerable
 point. question financial shocks disturbances,
 point made--whatever else one might want say them-that extent managed contained,
 managed contained high degree government

 see it. leaders banking investment banking institutions,
 foreign domestic, reached point think want

 think vulnerabilities setting something

 inflation side, keep coming side
 uneasy. look numbers listen everybody says

 stated: temporary things. can't quite get

 percent, depending upon kind agricultural land,
 states it's 40 45 percent; average, 38 percent.
 important fact, think, land continues drop

 Energy, petroleum mining, rocking along

 that, find past year predicted growth

 regard economy growing potential, would certainly

 question properly addressed July review rather

 seems growth GNP right low,

 don't find disturbing, considering discussions

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, wife tells I'm hard please

 don't think anything would gained pushing M1 long-run
 target range; contrary, think lot lose.
 financial market participants well aware parallel bands
 see us running short-run targets bands,
 think going question anti-inflationary resolve.
 Therefore, couldn't accept anything 5-1/2 percent, would
 put us top band. Actually prefer 5 percent,
 would give us little breathing room. don't know kind

 Greenbook suggests.
 matter changing policy: Committee
 adopt alternative B, suppose will, think people would
 regard clear easing short-run policy stance
 adopted March meeting. Now, nothing directive
 language indicate easing occurred taken
 small step way. particular term "maintain"
 first sentence alternative B would somewhat confusing.
 recognize system use term "degree reserve
 pressures" refers level borrowing. don't think
 outside world looks quite narrowly, might
 understand it.
 So, think that's least question ought
 address go "B" would guess Committee probably
 going do.
 MR. RICE. would like respond briefly

 facing inflation rate 5 percent, certainly would much

 toward "A."
 mean would willing relax borrowing
 little Jerry's recommendation accord
 borrowing would expect compatible alternative B--in
