 we’re right track. note befor, rang forecast hasn’t bad

 third question whether forecast accompani minutesstyl descript. releas forecast accompani monetari polici report,

 wai rearrang meet date get date work better. howev, seem
 though we’d work lot stuff, simultan keep

 question 6, understand argument longer-term forecast period. understand
 reveal futur polici prefer tradeoff, don’t think long-term forecast provid
 whole lot els. long-term forecast isn’t go realiz. it’s goal anyth els.
 it’s hard make forecast six month right mark, let alon sever year out,
 could impli know control actual longer period
 time. go extend horizon, would extend littl—to go, exampl,
 year half two three year perhap. would stai number variabl
 current forecast—nomin real gdp, unemploy, measur inflat.

 sixth, it’s realli import make sure public market understand high
