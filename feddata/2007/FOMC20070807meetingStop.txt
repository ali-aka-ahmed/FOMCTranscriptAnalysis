 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Let’s go back previous comment second question
 President Poole. Another standard reaction sell things liquid can’t
 unload things less liquid. One thing curious about—and don’t know
 data, question—in terms CDO/CLO issuance, know much held
 non-U.S. investors? example, told—and don’t know correct—by
 senior partner Goldman that, since ’03, mezzanine CDOs issued sold
 Asians Europeans. I’m wondering aware tripwires might

 liquid cover illiquidity something they’re stuck with. would interested little

 financial markets really provided wind back broader economy

 Perhaps best review dynamics different asset markets assess implications

 weeks culminating trading late Thursday Friday last week troubling, driven
 combination factors: first, symbolized perhaps one financial institution

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank useful discussion. usual, going
 briefly summarize heard. happy take comments that.
 want make short points. Again, key points made.
 participants expect growth remain moderate forecast period. Despite
 lower household wealth resulting weaker house stock prices, consumption likely
 continue grow labor markets remain strong, real incomes increase, gasoline prices
 moderate. Business investment also grow moderately, although lower productivity
 higher volatility could drags investment. Commercial real estate, particular, may
 slackening, retains good fundamentals. global economy strong. Industrial
 production expanding reasonable pace. However, downside risks growth noted
 perhaps received somewhat greater emphasis past meetings. notably, housing
 appears weakened further, sales new existing homes declining
 inventories unsold homes remaining high. Homebuilders experiencing financial strains,
 downward pressure home prices. Spillover consumption spending yet
 evident possible risk.
 regard, developments credit markets received considerable attention.
 positive side, repricing risk reevaluation underwriting standards seem
 appropriate. Liquidity still exists, credit still extended, markets may work
 problems own. lower dollar lower long-term Treasury rates also tend offset
 financial tightening. However, higher risk premiums, tougher underwriting, greater
 uncertainty may constrain housing investment spending, leading broader macroeconomic
 effects. more-pessimistic scenarios, dislocations credit markets may last awhile
 substantial effect credit availability costs businesses well homebuyers.

 possibility contagion severe financial instability also exists. Many participants took
 note NIPA revisions implications productivity growth, consumer saving,
 unit labor costs. Meeting participants tend put potential growth higher rates
 Greenbook.
 Views inflation similar previous meetings. Recent readings viewed
 reasonably favorable. However, risks inflation remain, including possible reversal
 transitory factors, tight labor markets, high price commodities, higher unit labor costs
 resulting lower productivity growth. all, risks inflation remain upside.
 summary heard. I’m sure lot could said. comments?
 not, let make additional comments. two important
 developments since last meeting. first downward revision NIPA growth
 numbers. It’s obvious yet, course, much reflects permanent decline
 productivity much transitory. certainly best guess
 long term nature. think main point I’d like make implications
 downward revision inflation monetary policy, except perhaps short run,
 obvious. question is, effect lower productivity growth aggregate
 demand? examples types phenomena. late ’90s, pickup
 productivity growth stimulated strong boom working stock market,
 consumption, investment, led overheating economy, whereas earlier part
 decade, productivity growth picked weak aggregate demand.
 jobless recovery associated that. remains seen exactly aggregate demand
 respond developments. think perhaps short run, given
 wage behavior unit labor costs, choose, would say slight bias
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 84 136
 
 toward higher inflation tighter money. longer run, would expect see lower
 long-term rates slower growth.
 second issue widely discussed around table financial market.
 interesting question looks like $100 billion credit losses
 subprime market reflected multiple trillions dollars losses paper wealth.
 it’s interesting question going there. think three reasons
 financial markets moved direction have. First, widespread
 repricing risk. is, obviously, healthy development, particularly overshoot,
 possibility. else equal, restrictive terms aggregate demand,
 makes policy tighter otherwise would be. second reason changes
 markets loss confidence ability investors evaluate credit
 quality, particularly structured products. information fog, heard
 described. much associated loss confidence credit-rating agencies.
 think one implications innovations seen financial
 markets going get rolled back. going see lending taken originate-todistribute vehicles put back onto portfolio balance sheets. question much
 effect adjustment process availability credit. third reason think
 markets reacted much concern macroeconomic implications
 happening. particular, fear subprime losses, repricing,
 tightening underwriting standards adverse effects housing market
 feed consumption, get vicious cycle. certainly reflected
 expectations policy.

 going go things going markets.
 good reviews that. Obviously, markets right functioning
 normally. conduits credit simply closed frozen. number companies
 difficulties short-term finance, so, per President Fisher’s comment,
 watching things carefully. prepared use tools address
 short-term financial crisis, one occur. longer term, course, policy
 directed toward protecting financial investors but, rather, toward macroeconomic
 objectives. important. question long-run implications
 financial market adjustment economy. think odds market
 stabilize. credits pretty strong except parts mortgage market. even
 notably tighter credit, tighter standards, probably loss confidence
 markets, higher risk premiums net restrictive. restrictive effect could
 come various magnitudes. could moderate, could severe,
 going monitor adjusts time. Again, bit risk—and tail risk
 mentioned financial sense also macro sense—that, credit
 severely restricted get feedback lower house prices, example,
 financial markets, situation would difficult deal with.
 two major issues people talked about. briefly

 MR. FISHER. Well, Mr. Chairman, background skittishness, best
 advice would recognize, extent, statement going marketplace,
 ails marketplace. best guidance would must become
 tripwire. think show steady hand. rather liked reference Hippocratic
 oath earlier, “Do harm.” think best accomplish acknowledging market
 turbulence yet implying given reaction might create moral hazard.
 I’m particularly mindful discussion press security analysts so-called
 Bernanke put, want make sure take action say anything might
 give rise expectation occur. Therefore, would suggest alternative B
 offers best policy response. is, favor keeping rate is.
 wording second paragraph acknowledges volatility markets.
 think addresses points Governor Kohn made growth employment, incomes,
 robust global economy. I’ve waited long time see word “global” statements.
 [Laughter] Whether gets left not, reflect reality. I’m mindful President
 Geithner’s point softening little, yet worry might become bit
 tripwire. would normal circumstances somewhat inclined toward last paragraph
 alternative A, yet didn’t hear around table, fully believe myself, things
 exactly roughly balanced. take point made presentation that,
 saying “downside risks growth increased somewhat,” opening door.
 refinement might suggest soften little word “policy
 concern remains risk inflation fail moderate expected.” taking word
 “predominant,” would leave consideration. actually talked somebody

 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think couple issues front
 us today. First, react recent inflation numbers? pleased recent
 reports, said, coming better expected, seems substantial chance
 improvement seen temporary get higher figures later
 year. Moreover, inflation expectations remain I’d like be, don’t think
 relax characterization inflation statement. second question face
 react recent turmoil financial markets. think need careful maintain

 support alternative B—that is, change fed funds rate today language
 revised version. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 95 136
 
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think inflation news continued
 encouraging, risks remain upside. respect growth, prospects
 worsened, think greater downside risk reasons discussed.
 think market response events inappropriate. perceive greater likelihood
 need cut fed funds rate sooner deeply seemed likely
 weeks ago, think essentially try leave expectations place today
 indicate intend respond asset prices problems particular dealers
 financial institutions directly assess economic consequences turmoil.
 question is, right language that? alternative B language
 proposed trying achieve exactly think appropriate. agree goal
 alternative B. I’m simply concerned actual language proposed.
 Particularly worry language paragraph 4. say “although downside
 risks growth increased somewhat, Committee’s predominant policy concern remains
 risk inflation fail moderate,” that’s like saying—perhaps respond
 strongly word “predominant”—that, yes, see greater downside risk, don’t care;
 remain totally focused inflation. [Laughter] bothers me. That’s comes across
 me. don’t think intention make way.
 would make two proposals soften it. think need dial down,
 think inflation risk remains upside. would second two suggestions
 already made. would second President Fisher’s suggestion remove word
 “predominant” paragraph 4. might say, “The Committee remains concerned
 risk inflation fail moderate expected.” Now, think downside risk
 increased growth side. I’m sure actually necessary say explicitly, think
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 96 136
 
 dialing paragraph 4 simply removing “predominant,” along additional
 language proposed line 2, might sufficient. think actually agree
 downside risks increased. want express that, would endorse President Poole’s
 suggestion move language downside risks paragraph 2, saying something
 “for households businesses, housing correction ongoing.” could
 say, “Although downside risks growth increased somewhat, nevertheless
 economy seems likely continue expand moderate pace.” would get there.
 Basically would say see it, nevertheless think likely economy
 grow moderate pace. financial turbulence diminishes markets stabilize,
 downside risks growth paragraph 4 continuing express asymmetric bias,
 worry inflation, we’ll comfortable living going forward, good
 summary are. suggestions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, couple things. First, satisfied current
 policy. think moment concern still inflation, think policy
 designed address that. saying that, also recognize—from observations
 I’ve heard today—that downside risks emerging
 brought risks balance, guess way say it. Complicating that, course,
 tighter credit conditions. think probably transitory, won’t know
 yet—maybe next meeting. leads conclude comfortable
 alternative B language think recognizes dynamic puts
 public. would stick alternative B see develop
 next meeting. Thank you.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 97 136
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. certainly comfortable maintaining
 fed funds rate is, I’m supportive that. think real key language.
 trying convey markets? far go, acknowledging many
 people share—a sense increased risk—without creating another set concerns
 marketplace? language tricky piece here. I’ve waffled bit feelings
 this. I’m inclined think Bill Poole Janet Yellen are—moving
 downside risks paragraph 2 opposed putting assessment risk. would
 supportive tone. Also, response Jeff’s comments earlier memo
 this, actually prefer language repricing risk rather tightening credit conditions
 simply emphasizes partly relative price adjustment going on.
 don’t want take strong stand that.
 one word concerns me, I’d like raise issue here. paragraph 3,
 nobody talked yet, first sentence, “readings core inflation
 relatively subdued recent months” change language previous statement,
 says, “improved modestly recent months.” worry little word “subdued”
 think becomes close making kind normative judgment
 level inflation happy with. I’m uncomfortable particular change
 language it, again, might imply normative statement without Committee’s
 agreeing view subdued not. I’d like suggest change
 back because, want convey stability continuity here,
 places change, places change, would rather change fewer words
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 98 136
 
 words going forward. would additional suggestion would make.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, feel hold rate,
 concerned principally way statement plays various audiences,
 particularly market. posture take acknowledge, reacting
 prematurely to, turbulence financial markets subdued improved inflation
 numbers, make effort maintain flexibility. bit torn
 paragraph 4 President Poole’s suggestion, sympathy for,
 concern paragraph 4 come across ritualistic repetition we’ve said every
 month several months and, therefore, convey sense we’re paying attention
 what’s going market. come ambivalent that. support President
 Poole’s suggestion, balance guess like statement alternative B is.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Rosengren.
 MR. ROSENGREN. support leaving target fed funds rate 5¼ percent.
 However, news since last meeting would seem elevated downside risk
 economic growth. elevated risk reflects baseline growth real GDP 2 percent (a
 considerable reduction previous Greenbook), greater uncertainty evolution
 housing market, concern fallout financial market disruptions. Given
 greater downside risk, would prefer language assessment risk paragraph
 alternative A, though like modification alternative B made, worried
 interpretation Fed put financial markets. although I’d prefer risk
 assessment alternative A, accurately reflects assessment risks, could
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 99 136
 
 certainly accept removing word “predominant.” would second choice. third
 choice would bow better understanding nuanced language, since
 certainly expertise, though hope develop years, could live
 alternative B language third choice.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like others, think keeping federal
 funds rate right thing do. need, others said, watch situation
 carefully see evolves. think we’re trying two things statement,
 others remarked. One make people aware we’re aware major market event
 occurred say we’re looking trying assess implications
 outlook hasn’t really—not yet, anyhow—caused major change fundamental
 assessment economy going. second thing trying make sure
 flexible platform move next couple meetings even,
 become necessary, intermeeting period. one see going lots
 different directions—the markets getting much turbulent implications outlook
 need move intermeeting period things settling go back
 inflation predominant risk. incoming data demand production remain
 consistent central forecast. others noted, could end coming
 easing policy somewhere road, right away.
 thought language alternative B things. acknowledged
 situation. reinforced sense moderate growth going forward thought
 things going added “supported solid growth employment incomes
 robust global economy.” rationale that, didn’t before.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 100 136
 
 also thought paragraph 4 really accurate reading. actually little surprised
 go-round how, almost universally, people said downside risks output
 increased still concerned inflation. thought
 paragraph 4 turned presciently—on part Chairman, Brian, whoever drafted
 it—a really accurate view Committee was. concern moving first
 piece paragraph 2 one risk paragraph 2. haven’t done
 before, right? risks output inflation talked paragraph 4.
 Another risk paragraph 4, risk inflation, asymmetry discuss
 risks. intended soften risk, think strikes creating precedent
 future hard live with, risks paragraphs risks
 paragraphs. Another thing could move inflation risk paragraph 3
 come one way another. think Committee wants come inflation
 side—in terms predominant risk main risk—and Committee isn’t quite ready go
 balance. seems paragraph 4, written, really captured center gravity
 Committee. favor that.
 One word moral hazard concern seen reacting:
 worried it. think kept eye, past twenty years, macro
 environment. adjusted policy stabilize economy, bring inflation down,
 pretty darn successful that. Asset prices go up, asset prices go down.
 Anybody bought lot high-tech stock, betting Greenspan put, still waiting
 recover money. [Laughter] don’t think ever existed. really don’t care people
 say; care do, need keep eye macro implications.
 Now, said presentation, think connection financial markets
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 101 136
 
 macroeconomy pretty complicated runs confidence things, too. I’m
 really worried moral hazard acting. markets continue turbulent
 see turbulence future—I agree Vice Chairman
 forward looking this—such turbulence potential adversely affecting economy.
 think go ahead act. think basically right thing ’87 ’98,
 don’t think need apologize it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. diving alternative B, I’d say part
 reason trying different clothes around language alternative B
 odd juxtaposition growth inflation time. growth risks
 seem driven largely financial market situation still don’t totally understand,
 even disagreement quickly come understanding. unlike
 typical juxtapositions, intermediate concerns inflation growth,
 strikes differences timing magnitude—that is, downside risk
 financial markets happens soon we’re middle don’t see yet,
 boy, might know soon could ugly outcomes. think differences
 here. also think differences power. power inflation pretty darn good,
 exercise kind judgment. power getting middle markets
 moving rates ¼ percentage point moving language harder decipher. That’s
 think suggestions language alternative B good ones, hard
 us wrestle with.
 reason come alternative B written strikes two
 goals. One clear markets, notwithstanding expectations
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 102 136
 
 see, think alternative B that. second goal trying buy
 insurance flexibility. worry that, drop “predominant,” become
 part parcel view are, might turn markets benign
 isn’t storm talked moment ago, hard go back word.
 don’t know go back “predominant” September meeting
 dropped it. ways think question is, Poole approach, drop
 “predominant” move downside risks paragraph 2, roughly equivalent
 alternative B is? reason think alternative B provides us
 flexibility end dropping downside risks eventuality comes pass.
 reasons Governor Kohn given, think probably right construct
 alternative B. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. also support keeping fed funds rate
 unchanged, much agree way Governor Kohn thinking we’re
 trying achieve. let describe think alternative B largely achieves that.
 key thinking decision changing statement is, first, whether something
 materially changed markets realize that, change statement,
 something actually happened and, second, whether gives us flexibility going
 forward make another change new information comes in. So, example, paragraph 2,
 acknowledging volatility talking credit conditions, housing market,
 offsetting factors employment, growth income, global demand—all things
 relevant. new things—the financial markets credit conditions—have bit
 important before. we’re acknowledging things actually
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 103 136
 
 happened intermeeting period. also like gives bit color what’s
 going we’re thinking things, piece one easily leave, add
 to, take back, valuable. like formulation paragraph 2
 acknowledges new information come way suggests fear
 excess concern sort acknowledges various factors, particularly financial conditions
 context others upside. balance is, think, nice.
 paragraph 3, agree President Plosser clear new
 information would want change characterization. see nothing wrong
 characterization there. concerned President Plosser makes
 value judgment. question made change. happy
 either way, using criterion information new change, quite sure
 changed it. think fine either way.
 paragraph 4, think important take step toward balance without going
 way toward balance much early tell, many people said. Putting
 downside risks makes lot sense tradition structure. Again, don’t
 see reason change overall formulation overall structure point, particularly
 markets jittery. don’t think going sort structural change
 statement. Even ultimately might want think it, think would
 time it. Also, like easy put take off, growth come back
 up, easily remove language. growth goes down, move toward balance risk
 easily want to, Governor Warsh said, drop “predominant,” cannot
 get back. feel stage—or least discussion around table
 am—where that. Also, think would strong reaction
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 104 136
 
 markets. markets saw acknowledged downside risk took
 “predominant” even took word “predominant,” would indicate much stronger
 risk much stronger signal going move quickly. think
 statement lead slight increase expectations cut little earlier, that’s
 perfectly acceptable can’t see better way get balance right. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously agree
 change federal funds rate. want talk statement. think
 statement would write, key thing viewpoint ask inflation
 objective really affects statement major way. believe 2 percent goal
 reasonable reasons discussed before. context, inflation moderated,
 would difficulty saying concerned moderated think, fact,
 has. say think want stick alternative B written
 two reasons. first reason actually conflicting situation clear
 whether think writing statement that’s appropriate Governor Mishkin
 statement that’s appropriate Committee whole. going deal
 challenge. read projections, it’s clear I’m high side, 2 percent
 higher median, around 1¾ 1.8. would difficulty accepting
 inflation objective 1.8 long Committee came consensus. think issue
 writing statement much difficult don’t consensus Committee.
 creating problem terms thinking get involved internal deliberation
 statement be, important future. think
 time deal that. one issues let’s deal point future.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 105 136
 
 second reason issue going terms financial markets
 kind impression give outside. agree Governor Kohn operating
 Greenspan put Fed put. clear so, except
 think impression created, would like mention little less
 sanguine done past. think one mistake made, perhaps I’m
 looking ex post. Fed lowered interest rates 75 basis points LTCM episode,
 brilliant stroke. exactly right thing do. think operation
 like that, basically restore confidence markets much like classic
 lender-of-last-resort operation, know want put liquidity; crisis
 over, want take out. time, quite critical Fed remove
 75 basis point decline, think created impression—I don’t know Greenspan put,
 element that—and hard dissipate impression. Maybe
 true people said weren’t trying that, create kind impression along
 lines. think issue perception still important. context, important
 give impression responding financial markets
 discussion concerned might problem future
 right affecting forecast major way. That’s exactly
 communicate public markets; context, changing statement much
 moving toward balance create problems along lines.
 worrying issues, would take word “predominant”
 statement. fact, might even take issue I’m worried about, say inflation
 moderated. given current situation, think best stick “predominant.”
 mention downside risks growth “predominant” side terms inflation
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 106 136
 
 create element balance. Thus think potential issue worry
 future statements grapple with. hope Committee could
 come consensus inflation objective coherent
 discussion issues; however, think time pursue that. support
 alternative B written. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. classic lender-of-last-resort operations, asked people Open
 Market Desk much additional reserves takes lower federal funds rate ¼ percentage
 point. order couple ten million—so 75 basis points added maybe $100, maybe
 $150 million instance. know, I’d venture probably trivial terms
 adding liquidity market LTCM. real effect altering then-current
 expected path real overnight federal funds rate. know, Rick, classic lender-of-lastresort option 1900s preventing interest rates spiking current rates,
 adding reserves driving interest rates. think confusion link things
 like ’87 ’98 classic lender-of-last-resort operation.
 MR. MISHKIN. there’s always issue mean word “classic.”
 I’m thinking lender-of-last-resort operation really restoring
 confidence. done without actually putting liquidity system. look
 successful lender-of-last-resort operation, announcement backstop
 system tremendous impact. course, one reason done ’87—with
 Greenspan actually sitting tub morning getting early announcing
 market opened Federal Reserve going backstop—was extremely important.
 I’m thinking context, wanted provide information markets,
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 107 136
 
 going going Bank Japan
 allow something spiral control. Clearly, basically taking insurance, saying
 Fed there. don’t need insurance anymore, there’s really strong argument
 take away. I’m talking terms liquidity per se trying
 terms expectations. episode important right thing, critical
 way financial markets recovered; think problem created didn’t reverse
 way that, actually lender-of-last-resort operation, put liquidity
 take out. That’s sense mean putting lower interest rates taking
 crisis over.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. Let get us back statement. [Laughter]
 Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. quickly, think
 actually fairly similar place, far apart basic diagnosis, that’s good, given
 complexity decisions going forward sense. want soften slightly
 asymmetry current statement give us bit flexibility show awareness
 change reality there.
 Quickly statement, first, agree that, question characterize
 display recognition financial market developments, reference volatility may
 capture it. Somebody suggested say something instead going “risk premium”
 something generally, think might slightly better—a small point. second
 question whether revert June inflation readings response, think,
 right observation President Plosser convey comfort level
 previous wording did. would fine going back June, could also live
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 108 136
 
 conveys sense readings continue reasonably favorable. would
 fine way is, could go back June language.
 question whether refer explicitly downside risks growth, we’ll
 first time—a sort consequential act—and, so, it. would
 fine leaving implicit rather introducing explicitly. think right: we’re going
 it, unless we’re going change structure statement significantly put risk
 assessment growth paragraph 2 risk assessment around inflation paragraph 3,
 need leave paragraph 4. So, again, risks growth, I’m okay putting
 language in. think it’s consistent broad objectives. guess preference would
 leave implicit.
 Finally, “predominant,” view repeat “predominant”
 would better simply stating Committee remains concerned risks
 concerned inflation fail moderate expected. don’t think arguments sticking
 “predominant” compelling. don’t think taking constrains options going
 forward. true it’s shift broad sense, don’t think need say starkly
 we’ve looked set risks—very different types risk, fast moving,
 uncertain, slower moving, probably manageable time—and say weighed
 balance think latter risks continue predominate. think that’s substance
 argument face. think would better slightly soften further. said that,
 live alternative B drafted. [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. May make two-handed intervention?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 109 136
 
 MR. MISHKIN. Could ask question Brian? “Predominant” key word.
 think might response markets leave take out, terms two
 elements. One issue markets would think future evolution policy.
 Two media might read whether reacting distress financial markets.
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, said earlier, it’s little hard judge market reactions right
 now, given flux financial markets. said, think introduction “downside
 risks,” explicit phrase statement obviously overlooked market
 participants, [laughter] think see least slight shift
 Committee’s body English. regard “predominant,” that’s another step
 direction—and think maybe even bigger shift.
 MR. MISHKIN. Right.
 MR. DUDLEY. think bigger shift. think first one unit, second
 maybe two units terms far go.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. another objection taking word “predominant.”
 don’t think sentence makes sense take out. [Laughter] put something
 in. cannot say problem.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, right. really rewrite sentence. Let
 try evaluate guidance. [Laughter] agree Brian one
 toughest ones write assess response. read commentary, expectations
 map, difficult know taken. don’t pretend know.
 Let start something easy. think President Plosser absolutely right.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 110 136
 
 reason change paragraph 3 without reason. unless anyone concerns, I’d like change
 paragraph 3 back June language. Okay. That’s first thing.
 Regarding tougher question—and President Yellen, President Poole, others
 raised interesting possibility—again, without much confidence going resist
 following reasons. first reason mostly complicated, [laughter] moves things
 around ways make even harder market understand we’re trying do.
 Another reason statement “although downside risks growth increased
 somewhat,” follow advice put new sentence paragraph 2,
 essentially say financial markets reason downside risks increased,
 whereas factors—the housing market, automobile sales, things sort—that
 could viewed increasing downside risks. guess that’s recommendation.
 “predominant,” think word neutralized significant extent use. may
 recall used phrase “predominant policy concern,” changed second sentence,
 market based decided gone way balance. concern that,
 get rid “predominant” mention downside risks growth anywhere,
 viewed gone mostly balance, don’t think that’s right
 Committee.
 one thought, may come late day here. going back
 paragraph 2, “financial markets volatile recent weeks.” President Geithner raised
 idea changing something risk. One small concern have, would
 good put earlier, phrase refers something going markets per se
 effect markets economy, heightens put risk little.
 alternative would replace first phrase something like “investors demanded
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 111 136
 
 greater compensation risk.” would market development evidently affects yields
 borrowing costs. see nodding. see frowning. I’m sure.
 MR. MISHKIN. Could clarify? saying would get rid “credit
 conditions become tighter”?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No. “Investors demanded greater compensation risk,
 credit conditions become tighter households businesses.” right.
 excitement.
 MR. LACKER. clear whether probability distributions fundamentals
 shifted whether probability distribution marginal utility shifted. see
 mean?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No. [Laughter]
 MR. LACKER. clear whether attitudes given risk changed
 assessments magnitude risks changed.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Oh, see you’re saying. Well, actually way
 phrased intentionally say risks increased rather say price risk
 increased.
 MR. LACKER. says one them. says latter.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. that’s want say.
 MR. LACKER. that’s clear. clear isn’t widening
 probability distribution relevant outcomes.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. don’t see snowball. [Laughter]
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Don’t give yet. “Risk premiums financial markets
 increased, credit conditions tightened households”—it true don’t
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 112 136
 
 really know source increase risk premiums is, true risk premiums
 increased. Volatility particularly interesting policy perspective,
 many people said, we’re damp volatility. considerations relevant
 macroeconomy financial market stability sense happened—and that’s
 different way saying it.
 MR. LACKER. No, encompasses referring to, would
 way it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. would agree that. Now, doesn’t say pricing changed. Let
 give example. Kimberly-Clark last week went market $2 billion debt.
 couldn’t move unless change-of-control provision. price impact. part
 risk premiums, we’re seeing pricing per se. like wording President Geithner
 suggested.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner. I’m sorry. next.
 MR. KROSZNER. Yes, principle think good way characterize what’s going
 on. going back criteria using, many cases risk premiums simply
 moved close historical levels record lows. stay historical averages time,
 that’s necessarily something that’s wrong problematic. may difficult take
 phrase away risk premiums stay least markets. don’t think
 that’s necessarily bad thing, I’ve heard number people around table suggest that.
 certain markets, historical averages, many markets simply
 moved historical average, bit concerned able take away.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 113 136
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, say “have increased” next
 phrase say “credit conditions become tighter” also makes value judgment whether
 they’re appropriate.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn, comment?
 MR. KOHN. Yes, do. see want take “volatile,” agree that.
 Unlike President Lacker, think important keep credit conditions it’s
 price. little concerned saying “risk premiums increased credit
 conditions become tighter” puts price. Suppose didn’t phrase red.
 “owing developments financial markets, credit conditions become tighter,”
 “reflecting recent developments financial markets, credit conditions become tighter.”
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. okay that.
 MR. KOHN. prefer “risk premiums.”
 MR. MOSKOW. could go back original language Bluebook. says
 essentially thing. change sentence around.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think good idea. Credit conditions becoming
 tighter. saw bank surveys happened.
 MR. MOSKOW. Bluebook.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. understand, think acknowledgement
 effects financial market developments recent weeks economy needed make
 sure people understand we’re awake.
 MR. KOHN. proposed language “risk premiums” “financial markets”?
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 114 136
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. “Have increased, credit conditions become tighter.”
 housing.
 MR. MISHKIN. Fine me.
 MR. MADIGAN. want point out, Mr. Chairman, two clauses seem
 overlap considerable degree, “tighter risk premiums” “tighter credit conditions.” It’s
 clear precisely distinction we’re trying draw there.
 MR. MISHKIN. Well, “credit conditions” general encompass
 price nonprice.
 MR. MADIGAN. raises question mind first clause necessary.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, think market-traded assets, “credit
 conditions” sounds like mortgages, retail type credit provision. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. I’m okay want put “premium,” Vice Chairman’s language,
 there. think markets become volatile, nothing wrong saying
 that, credit conditions tightened, fact, people thinking
 volatility markets. minds. We’re acknowledging it, said,
 comfortable language.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Let get sense around table, could.
 think President Hoenig makes point volatility financial markets could viewed
 effect economy uncertainty sorts factors. One option
 “financial markets volatile recent weeks.” second option “risk premiums
 financial markets increased.” wants “volatility”? [Laughter] see five. wants
 make change?
 MR. KOHN. guess would.
 
 August 7, 2007
 
 115 136
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Oh, great. [Laughter] right.
 MR. MISHKIN. flip coin?
 MR. KOHN. deciding vote.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay.
 MR. LACKER. One factor “volatility” broad term, “risk
 premiums” refers narrow set markets, way shifts focus equity markets.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. apologize profusely bringing up. don’t
 leave it? [Laughter] discussion, proposal follow President Plosser
 replace paragraph 3 June version. Please call roll.
 MS. DANKER. I’ll read directive wording Bluebook balance risk
