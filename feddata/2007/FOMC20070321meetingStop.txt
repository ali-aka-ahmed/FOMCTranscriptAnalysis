 March 20, 2007—Afternoon Session
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody. Let first welcome
 Dennis Lockhart sitting Federal Reserve Bank Atlanta. We’ll start Bill Dudley.
 MR. DUDLEY. 1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Financial markets become
 much turbulent since last meeting—especially subprime mortgages
 associated securities, U.S. global equities, foreign exchange markets.

 market area experienced stress—the subprime mortgage market—to
 markets?
 Regarding subprime mortgage market, deterioration appears driven mostly
 fundamental developments. know, delinquency rates subprime

 problems hurt mortgage loan volumes. example, Mortgage Bankers

 Turning next U.S. equity market, less clear-cut whether decline
 prices rise volatility fundamentally based. several observers
 noted, equity valuations appear excessive. case,
 equities turbulent corporate emerging-market debt,
 spreads remain unusually narrow? Although point legitimate, two
 fundamental developments make U.S. equity prices less attractive deserve
 mention. First, equity analysts reducing earnings forecasts 2007.
 Although top-down view equity strategists S&P 500 index
 changed much, bottom-up basis, earnings expectations dropped sharply.
 shown exhibit 6, aggregate forecasts individual sector analysts
 indicate growth rate S&P 500 earnings 2007 6 percent,
 9 percent beginning year. contrast, S&P 500 earnings
 grown annual rate 10 percent four consecutive years.
 surprise falling earnings expectations could weigh equity prices.
 Second, uncertainty growth outlook increased. shows clearly,
 example, recent primary dealer survey. greater uncertainty
 growth outlook presumably implies greater risk, rise uncertainty
 should—all else equal—result lower share prices. contrast, easier
 explain modest widening corporate credit spreads. theory, lower share
 prices higher volatility imply greater risk default, imply wider
 credit spreads. Corporate credit spreads behaved manner consistent
 this. Josh Rosenberg research group Federal Reserve Bank New
 York recently investigated issue. found spread widening highyield corporate debt sector consistent past periods implied
 volatility equities rose sharply. Exhibit 7 summarizes one key result.

 episode, VIX index rose 848 basis points, BB corporate spread rose
 27 basis points. rise compares average rise 21 basis points BB
 spread ten cases VIX rose sharply. rise
 recent episode well within range historical experience.
 many areas asset prices moved sharply, risk-reduction
 efforts appear played biggest role. example, foreign exchange
 markets, biggest currency moves currency pairs associated socalled carry trades, yen Swiss franc low-yielding currencies

 suggesting risk positioning driving price yield movements.
 Finally, short-term interest rate expectations shifted substantially since
 last FOMC meeting. shown exhibit 12, near-term expectations shifted,
 market participants expecting modest reduction federal funds rate
 target late summer. However, federal funds rate futures curve still

 expectations shifted sharply, larger move toward easing. shown

 Compared shift market expectations, forecasts primary dealers
 changed much. Exhibits 14 15 compare dealer expectations market

 horizontal bold lines represent market expectations. blue circles represent
 different dealer forecasts. green circles represent average dealer forecast

 dealer forecast changed much since January FOMC meeting—the green

 dispersion among dealers’ forecasts changed much—in fact, range
 blue circles slightly narrower currently. Although many dealers mention
 uncertainty growth outlook increased, appear

 dealers’ forecasts market expectations? think three major
 explanations. First, dealers’ forecasts modal forecasts reflect
 downside risks many dealers believe emerged growth outlook.
 Second, dealer forecasts often lag behind economic market developments.
 “downside risks” grow big enough pass threshold dealers likely
 alter modal forecasts. Third, downward shift market expectations
 may represent risk-reduction efforts. investor speculative risk positions
 would vulnerable economic weakness might hedge risks buying

 Nevertheless, potential gap market expectations Committee’s

 MR. LACKER. That’s helpful. But, still, apart green dots, he’s telling us there’s

 We’re still track moderate growth gradually ebbing inflation. economy enough

 housing correction enough knock economy moderate growth track.
 Growth modestly potential, along unwinding special factors like rent

 Real-side data reflect fact downshift above-trend growth several years

 we’re seeing downshifts demand inventories capital align slower pace

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let say outset believe
 moderate-growth scenario likely 2007. many already discussed,
 thought business fixed investment particularly real upside opportunity
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 consider real downside risk. Greenbook marked BFI next couple
 quarters, think there’s reason concerned it.
 Let confine rest remarks market tumult past several weeks
 give views that, broadly consistent Bill said outset. First,
 sense markets seem telling us real economy weaker. first-quarter
 earnings numbers Bill showed us much reflect trend could seeing
 suggests downside risk equity markets Governor Kohn referred moment
 ago. markdown data fourth quarter 2006, disappointing data regarding business fixed
 investment, weakness subprime market, forth suggest perhaps
 markets reacting U.S. domestic economy somewhat weaker shape
 could expected even couple months ago.
 cause market tumult past several weeks? markets cannot
 single proximate cause, tendency either construct one completely
 dismissive. view, subset rather sophisticated investors past six months
 looking opportunity, maybe say excuse, pull back certain
 markets credit-risk spreads unusually low; past several weeks,
 found one. generalized discomfort markets priced perfection levels
 volatility seem uncorrelated real world we’re trying analyze. Many us
 noted speeches past couple quarters surprised level
 certainty implied market prices, think message starting find way
 marketplace. tumult volatility we’ve seen past several weeks will,
 continues, make difficult us gauge what’s going on.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 63 196
 
 Might financial market tumult actually affect real economy going forward?
 Generally, would said financial market activities quite distinct real
 economy. case business fixed investment, can’t help believe market
 uncertainty, talk recession, animal spirits certainly negatively affected—all
 might affect boards directors management teams trying decide
 whether step gas cap-ex might get retreat even further. Given strong balance
 sheets, incredibly strong operating cash flows, momentum have, I’m
 puzzled Tim Geithner haven’t seen capital investment. tumult
 markets recent weeks gives reason concerned there. Perhaps management
 teams going find share buybacks even compelling compared alternative
 capital investment.
 general, took volatility markets first blush probably proper wakeup call folks gotten perhaps little complacent going on,
 particularly credit markets. spent lot time New York past several weeks,
 think that, wake-up call, many market participants seem hit snooze button.
 [Laughter] Many reviewing portfolios risk positions certainly, seeing bit
 caution. Perhaps that’s justified real economic fundamentals lemming
 phenomenon. is, investment banks asset managers front
 they’re making decisions credit-risk button client-risk button. past couple

 People wanted every meeting making underwriting commitments. called
 back days later said, “No one wants talk again.” [Laughter] worry
 whether wake-up call actually felt.
 Now, could market volatility recent weeks spread beyond subprime market
 lead kind credit crunch would meaningful downside risks economy? tried
 imagine circumstances would come. First, looked financial intermediaries,
 rather trying distinguish commercial banks investment banks, hedge funds,
 private equity, tried think creators credit, distributors credit,
 holders credit, forgetting labels associated them. Typically,
 rather robust capital markets past several years, institutions would decide
 areas would in. create products get books,
 make big bets deciding hold not? Many decided could
 three businesses. three businesses profitable. extent portfolio
 position longer fit, could sell syndicate quickly. new environment,
 however, new volatility, portfolio holdings time may prove harder liquidate,
 out-of-the-money options creators structured products writing may
 longer free. couple weeks ago, Warren Buffett described one financial hedge fund
 phenomena. described groups “innovators, imitators, swarming
 masses incompetents.” [Laughter] won’t describe category markets,
 many financial institutions seem following one particular premier investment bank
 managed creator products, syndicator, taking large principal
 positions.
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 happens financial institutions get uncomfortable markets

 cite one example, President Fisher raised, large, highly leveraged transaction

 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. much agree President Stern’s

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One way think situation
 compare what’s happening now, last meeting, two meetings before.

 One possibility that, fact, bounceback—that strong fundamentals terms

 We’ve seen weaker numbers terms productivity, think sort cyclical

 going what’s left—it longer trend transitory movements,
 particularly hard forecast. bad side overall better news, think key
 inflation expectations seem solidly grounded. It’s hard know exactly

 However, also important recognize don’t see reason dropping much

 leads issue statement. I’m open language there, like
 wording “the Committee’s principal policy” “predominant,” whichever prefer,
 “concern remains risk inflation fail moderate expected.” I’m little uneasy

 say something along lines “the extent timing additional firming”

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.

 resulted downward adjustment expected growth, highlighted downside
 risk activity side. output still running close potential; level terms, might
 even beyond potential; it’s big problem. think see risk inflation
 won’t moderate still substantial probably greater risk shortfall

 lot, avoiding giving impression we’re reacting way financial market
 developments; maintaining primary emphasis inflation risks; and, hope, inducing
 decline expected federal funds rates. agree President Poole market
 constructively building expectations, shouldn’t push ourselves. I’m
 sure it’s possible meet goals. [Laughter]
 Alternative B comes close think could come acknowledging mixed data
 emphasizing expect moderate growth ahead, emphasizing recent readings
 inflation high—particularly shift last time, suggested
 little disappointed inflation inflation risks—and pointing
 Committee’s principal policy concern remains inflation fail moderate expected.
 “principal” versus “predominant,” I’m sort indifferent. guess I’d lean slightly
 direction “predominant” reason Vincent gave—you used “predominant”
 testimony, Mr. Chairman. it’s big deal.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. already suggested, I, too, favor
 maintaining fed funds rate today 5¼ percent. said first go-round, data
 received since last meeting certainly increased uncertainty forecast.
 think fundamentals haven’t changed much. Besides, discussed
 yesterday, earlier signs moderating inflation seem ebbed somewhat, inflation
 still seems higher I’d like see. still concerned upside risk
 inflation. Although uncertainty real growth grown somewhat,
 overcome concern inflation point. Thus, see more-convincing evidence

 data evolve suggest slowdown going worsen, FOMC clearly
 would need allow fed funds rate fall equilibrium real rates level
 pace consistent making progress goal price stability. Nevertheless,
 time that.
 Turning language, regarding new alternative B gave us yesterday, I’m
 actually pretty happy language. think section 2 good job, I’m
 fairly comfortable language section 3. I’ve said before, although skeptical
 inflation pressures moderating own, cannot bring endorse language
 potential, capacity utilization. reading empirical evidence casts serious
 doubt usefulness measures forecast inflation. don’t like idea
 perpetuating marketplace belief might useful long run
 damage credibility. you’ve heard say before, won’t belabor point
 further. final section balance risks significant part
 statement, couple points make there. Frankly, I’m pretty happy way
 new version reads. think represents slight recognition economy weakened,
 without explicit it; it’s implicit acknowledgement. could live
 language proposed.
 President Hoenig suggested would like “firming.” guess I’m little torn. I’m
 sympathetic point view; suggested, fact real rate falling,
 holding rate constant actually making slight firming policy. I’m sure
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 markets fully understand subtlety—of either language view policy—but
 think might helpful communicate point, back communication
 issue. So, frankly, I’m pretty happy leaving fed funds rate is, could live
 language alternative B is.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also favor leaving policy rate
 unchanged today, support language alternative B, although find sympathetic
 assessment risk language alternative A. incoming information received
 since last meeting led believe economy may firmly footed
 thought last meeting. However, sentiment underlying strength
 economy taken turns past year, think assessment risk
 language alternative may convey greater certainty real-side risks think
 currently know. think removing “additional firming” phrase we’ve using
 time accurately reflects softer tone incoming data influenced

 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I’m largely agreement I’ve
 heard around table far morning. others commented, think yesterday’s
 discussion incoming data economy suggest uncertainty outlook,
 terms growth inflation, increased least bit, don’t think provide
 significant reason change policy adjust federal funds rate point. continue
 favor alternative B language associated it. I’m perfectly happy

 environment suggest short-term equilibrium real interest rate may lower now;
 so, maintaining fed funds rate 5¼ percent may provide bit policy restraint

 suggests effect minor beyond near term. increased uncertainty

 Let make comments language. agree Cathy Minehan’s comment
 section 2—of stopping statement phrase “moderate pace coming quarters.”
 put period there. agree everything said reasons taking additional
 language, would add that, written, mentions housing again. housing
 mentioned twice section, think it’s unnecessary add additional phrases
 end. statement comes much succinct focused stop phrase
 “coming quarters.” question “predominant” versus “principal,” prefer sticking
 “predominant” since used testimony. would guess

 it’s better we’re consistent here, would preference using language
 used testimony.
 “additional firming” question Tom Hoenig raised, sympathy
 this. Bluebook said, it’s difficult know markets react
 change. It’s always tentative markets going react, Bluebook said
 judgment tentative usual they’ll react change statement.
 think reinforce market’s anticipation future policy ease probably increase
 expectations ease. said that, think new version accurately reflect
 views views around table. it’s close call, balance think ought

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. think likely effect taking firming language afternoon
 Mike Moskow suggests. important point conditions market
 period next meeting. think it’s going driven flow incoming
 data, think that’s important point.
 MR. MOSKOW. Well, we’ll see. [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. Good answer. think it’s tentative—the judgment tentative.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. That’s totally immaterial whether going affect rate
 next meeting. mean, lots changes rates could occur next
 meeting, effect statement rates meeting could persist next
 meeting. don’t see it’s relevant, Bill.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.

 93 196
 
 MR. LOCKHART. Well, like many others, agree keeping funds rate
 current level language alternative B. We’re experiencing real growth rate
 expected, inflation longer declining. said that, I’m comfortable
 current policy don’t see need move become convinced forecast
 inflation moderation won’t realized. regard language, I’m yet master
 nuances, [laughter] don’t strong opinions “predominant” versus “principal.”
 “predominant” consistent past, strike slightly stronger.
 Therefore, I’ll go consensus, would favor that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Well, Mr. Chairman, yesterday indicated concern downside, even
 though come District running pretty warm economy. soundings
 business leaders interpretation heard around table yesterday lead
 conclude perhaps one revision one shock, including possibly financial market
 shock credit crunch shock, away recession. I’m favor alternative B. I’m still
 concerned inflationary pressures. I’m impressed Tom Hoenig’s arguments
 powerful ethanol forces society, think that’s adequately reflected
 last section. is, things changed stronger economic data and, case,
 stronger verisimilitude, similitude, private sector, leaves space
 tighten last section balanced statement.
 want comment President Moskow President Minehan pointed
 second section. That’s key point I’d like dwell on—I think it’s wise make full stop
 word “quarters.” “Still favorable” implies doubt, don’t think that’s wise thing
 us imply. Second, repeat housing. Third, can’t say certainty
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 94 196
 
 gradual waning correction housing market; don’t know. So, again,
 would strongly recommend full stop word “quarters.” Finally,
 play role broken record suggest insert word “global”
 “resource utilization” don’t continue belief oriented toward
 closed economy. would recommendations, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m okay leaving fed funds rate unchanged
 today. say despite fact inflation readings less favorable lately. Core
 inflation clearly higher want. see little reason expect moderation anytime soon
 without action part. truth forecast that, Greenbook says, expect
 moderation rate 1 basis point month less, would take statistician quite
 discern statistically moderation all. Concerns growth continue keep
 us sidelines, recent jitters subprime mortgages business investments
 added ongoing concern since last meeting. concerns given jitters well
 would prefer stronger growth less times past concerns
 deterred needed action inflation. repeat, I’m okay leaving fed funds rate
 unchanged. said, believe need tighten year reduce inflation,
 doesn’t seem like propitious time so.
 regard statement, much agree President Hoenig. I’m sure
 understand language section 4 supposed convey. one hand, seems
 retain even strengthen anti-inflation tilt labeling inflation principal policy concern.
 hand, move symmetric language second sentence would seem remove
 tightening bias. Thus sentences seem work opposite directions. broadly, agree

 President Hoenig. loosening sense tightening bias
 statement. also agree President Plosser. I’ll register agreement concern
 capacity utilization language. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also generally share views alternative B
 favor maintaining federal funds rate today. thought I’d highlight couple
 things. First, think statement needs reflective real economy rather financial
 markets, discussed yesterday. let spend moment reference “still-favorable
 financial conditions” alternative B. think financial conditions still favorable,
 that’s honest depiction events, rest statement reference coming
 quarters. think question really is, enter debate describing financial
 conditions, get it? meet next, I’m wondering we’ll
 describe financial conditions. stop reference thereto, saying? is,
 think markets adjusting orderly way. don’t feel now, feared weeks
 ago, would say things ensure adjustment occurs. don’t refer
 financial conditions continue suggest think economy expand
 moderate pace coming quarters, shows degree comfort
 financial market tumult hasn’t really changed central tendency. though I’m
 comfortable honest depiction alternative B, worry bit exit
 strategy is. can’t come better way refer financial conditions without
 inviting discussion, I’m left puzzlement exit strategy question.
 important thing we’re accomplishing alternative B suggesting aren’t
 going come rescue market tumult, market discipline working, don’t want
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 96 196
 
 complacency markets, job make sure people make money
 markets. job, many said, keep economy even keel. that,
 favor alternative B, remain little uncomfortable someone tell answer
 question next regarding reference still-favorable financial conditions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. I, too, favor alternative B—keeping federal
 funds rate constant point. discussion yesterday, gather many us still see
 cases substantial risk inflation won’t come is. Also,
 discussion yesterday, think bit uncertainty—some fatter tails—and
 modifications statement reflect uncertainty useful.
 Let work bottom go risk assessment section 4. like risk
 assessment. removal explicit reference firming certainly interpreted
 markets opening possibility cut line, hadn’t explicitly opened
 before. offset bit—I think Jeff Lacker getting this, although think actually
 somewhat positive rather negative—by characterizing Committee’s inflation concern
 “principal.” slight softening “predominant” makes sense data come
 since Chairman enunciated “P” word, “predominant” word. [Laughter] “Principal”
 appropriately reflective new information way people talked gives us
 bit flexibility line tails somewhat fatter, reflects
 discussion. Also, take Vince’s presentation 2000-01 heart, getting little
 flexibility may bad idea time.
 section 3, it’s important acknowledge readings little
 people comfortable with, think makes sense go language. section
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 97 196
 
 2, things like much, things don’t like. phrases recent indicators
 mixed adjustment housing sector ongoing good ways
 characterize discussion yesterday accurate reflections what’s going
 economy. like phrase “the adjustment housing sector ongoing,” certainly agree
 economy “seems likely continue expand moderate pace coming quarters.”
 Although principle would favor shorter section 2, cutting there, might
 want least little something else. would say “supported by, among things,
 gains income,” leave wording there. I’m actually quite strongly opposed including
 “still-favorable financial conditions” reasons enunciated.
 phrase look like weak attempt say really, really believe markets
 okay—that is, weak attempt talk markets. use phrase, we’re thinking
 low bid-ask spreads capital that’s flowing markets. There’s
 real chance phrase misinterpreted focusing equity markets, don’t
 think us intends mean. Also, Governor Warsh’s concern important one.
 get talking market? market goes down? don’t think it’s good
 us using language can’t explain way of. speech testimony could
 explain mean “still-favorable financial market conditions.” kind
 crimped “kabuki” language statement, think would much better omit
 reference. Given good phrase ongoing adjustment housing
 sector first sentence, I’m sure accomplish taking away giving
 color waning correction. neutral uncertainty market—that
 adjustment ongoing—is appropriate. would favor either cutting things
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 98 196
 
 “coming quarters” putting something like “supported by, among things, gains
 income.” Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. precedent, Vince, reference
 financial conditions described favorable otherwise? We’ve said it’s supported
 accommodative policy.
 MR. REINHART. going say mostly references would stance
 policy, opposed financial conditions.
 MR. KOHN. think back 2001, cut rates, I’m sure. Overall
 concern cutting things “quarters” “gains income” statement
 would kind weak. say indicators mixed adjustment housing
 sector ongoing, there’s act faith here. Somehow giving rationale
 moderate growth income ahead weakens statement. income phrase always struck
 endogenous: “We think growth going moderate income go
 growth.” see worries mention financial conditions. people around
 table mentioned concern.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. could something like “still, taken together, economy
 seems likely expand moderate pace.” think Governor Kroszner right on. terms
 shortness language, highlighting three things really run risk
 appear things going focus lot attention. don’t want convey,
 particularly message financial conditions, that’s we’re going put
 attention.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 99 196
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let ask question. intention
 comment recent market volatility. intention say interest rates low, stock
 prices pretty strong, liquidity good, going support growth. Would changing
 to, say, “aided supportive financial conditions” something like that, help?
 MS. MINEHAN. fully agree Governor Kroszner’s idea thinking short
 form explain risky. Given volatility recently seen
 concern, many expressed, Committee save people stock market
 problems, think run risk highlighting “financial conditions” statement right
 now.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. feel strongly issue. I’d like underscore arguments
 made—I think unanimity around table. job get real
 economy right. We’re opening door entails significant risk. Governor Warsh made
 good comment: exit strategy open door? question whether
 opening door necessary. don’t believe it’s necessary juncture.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. way would look issue suppose another break
 stock market 5 percent 8 percent, something like that. put “financial conditions”
 now, clearly couldn’t put next time condition. would mean
 us take out? That’s why, among things people said, would prefer
 in.

 100 196
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. get general sense agreement around table,
 unless someone wants speak strongly favor financial conditions. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. No, don’t want speak strongly favor retaining reference
 financial conditions. think, along lines Governor Kohn expressed, need
 provide basis expecting moderate growth continue. Otherwise sentence
 come across act faith doesn’t seem particularly compelling. don’t see
 mentioning financial conditions us damage, it’s actually valuable providing
 rational judgment—and judgment.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. objective, we’re trying find short ways
 say it. Anyone else? President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, don’t problem. agree Cathy length.

 you’ve said said anything else put in.
 happens next time income lower forth? don’t think “financial conditions”

 now; think owe people explanation, Cathy.
 MS. MINEHAN. whole statement faith, though. [Laughter] relies
 economic models forecasts ton detail ever express. say recent

 still think economy likely expand. Aside writing treatise here, don’t know
 say could feel comfortable reconsider.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 101 196
 
 MR. MOSKOW. agree that. look said last time, reference
 specifics housing. stop statement word “quarters,” that’s exactly
 we’ll time. Now, would make minor suggestion. word “still” could
 changed back “overall” continue last time. “Overall, economy seems
 likely continue expand moderate pace coming quarters.” wording encompasses
 we’ve looked information that’s assessment.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. difference first sentence last time positive
 sentence. first sentence time negative sentence.
 MR. MOSKOW. That’s think word “overall” would help.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. “Overall, however.” [Laughter]
 MR. MOSKOW. thought “however,” preferred use language.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. two-handed interventions? Governor
 Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. get perspective this, again, go back
 think December. We’re really much different forecast
 December, except little uncertainty. means assessment risk
 lean toward keeping language last meeting December meeting,
 particularly issue President Hoenig mentioned—that need indicate
 still vigilant inflation we’re worried it. issue think
 change seen removing bias, big impact markets.
 That’s meeting. However, Vince convincing. Maybe it’s
 wonderful vests. [Laughter] might notice, Vince, tried liven wearing
 double-breasted suit. little action going here, different usual. [Laughter]
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 102 196
 
 It’s really ghost 2000 worries me. argument could situation
 get shock need flexibility deal actually important.
 case, concerns along lines President Hoenig’s, I’m willing live new
 language alternative B reason mentioned. think “predominant”
 little stronger connotation—not dictionary used testimony—
 would stay “predominant.” sort offset, would keep level.
 terms big debate regarding rationale, think tough call.
 like mentioning financial markets, Governor Warsh said. crafting language
 difficult. guess end KISS principle, “keep simple, stupid,” would
 put full stop “quarters.” Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m comfortable
 center gravity discussion. boundaries shifted bit, face little
 uncertainty growth front. think there’s still asymmetry balance risks
 face, need continue highlight risk inflation may moderate enough.
 probability tighten significantly diminished, think expectations
 makes sense policy still market’s expectations. don’t think
 situation means need try push market’s expectations ours. adjusting
 statement slightly direction neutral, face risk acknowledge
 market price easing already have. better live risk
 preserve formulation implies probability tightening don’t think justified.
 need give flexibility move neutral sooner might seemed
 likely. Therefore, broad outlines alternative B make sense me.

 section 2, said, reason putting texture basis
 forecast going forward was, part, counteract fact we’re suddenly darker nearterm outlook. absence texture forecast makes statement darker conveys
 concern. although like minimalism although lot sensible things said
 specific references financial conditions housing, think there’s value
 texture basis view. I’m troubled reference
 financial conditions many are. could modify rationale say “supported
 income gains, overall financial conditions, gradual waning” characterization
 financial conditions implicit rather explicitly favorable. don’t think
 would go far meeting concerns expressed around table. would fine
 Moskow formulation, stopping “quarters.” think rest wording right.
 “predominant” versus “principal,” let give following argument. don’t
 believe plain language reading two words justifies conclusion “principal”
 read softer “predominant.” People disagree, answering question
 expect achieve changing “predominant” “principal,” I’m sure we’d win basic
 argument people would say, “Yeah, it’s softer.” So, argument consistency, would
 stay “predominant.” don’t think views risks inflation front shifted
 significantly since testimony, don’t problem maintaining that. Thank
 you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. could, I’d like clarify slightly earlier comments sense

 I’m sympathetic “financial conditions” think there’s real potential confusion

 register that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. everyone spoken? Well. [Laughter] Let
 try find consensus here. First, agree sentiment around table. recommend
 action today. continue emphasize inflation risk—I think there’s strong feeling
 remains greater risk. acknowledgement uncertainty risk increased
 sides dual mandate, balance risks seem changed much.
 Supporting idea keeping rate that, best tell, level rate

 currently seems right foster objectives. Also people noted, standing pat,
 considerable ability tighten de facto market expectations move toward actual revealed
 behavior. would counsel patience rate maintain rate current level today.
 Let take stab statement. think agree section 1. [Laughter]
 section 3, let note suggestion of, think President Stern. I’m sympathetic. didn’t
 hear much support, however, again, it’s change. would recommend stay
 current section 3.
 section 4, first small point. think mild preference “predominant”
 “principal” consistent testimony. extent we’re trying lean easing
 expectations, “predominant” slightly stronger, would beneficial respect. let
 propose change. recognize risk second sentence section 4 potential
 mislead market bit. concern second sentence using
 simply literally true anymore. implication certain next move going
 increase, it’s matter much. trying time
 get language get something descriptive. benefits
 second sentence are, first, create flexibility and, second, refers things
 right-hand side Taylor rule—that is, inflation output—and doesn’t make
 statement future policy actions, people seem prefer avoiding whenever
 possible. Again, although viewed small step toward balance flexibility,
 fairly strong statement inflation risk. particular, we’ve introduced
 think inflation risks specific concern inflation moderate,
 different somewhat stronger statement had. acknowledge may

 assets policy.
 respect description section 2, intention was, given first sentence
 relatively negative, give modest rationale thinking economy seems likely
 continue expanding. Let try one suggestion. Perhaps find solution. One reason
 quick summary difficult story recovery is, fact, fairly complicated.
 involves certainly ending housing correction also assumptions inventory correction,
 investment coming back moderate pace, number things. notion
 look fundamental factors would underlying assumption growth,
 income, grown rapidly, supportive financial conditions. hear concerns.
 Greenbook forecast calls moderate growth essentially components except
 housing. particular, expects consumption grow 2 percent; investment,
 2 percent; support government spending net exports; on. something along
 lines “supported growth nonhousing components final demand” might descriptive
 way saying think that, although housing drag, components
 economy support moderate growth. That’s suggestion.
 MR. MISHKIN. Could repeat sentence?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. last phrase would “supported growth nonhousing
 components final demand.”
 MR. MISHKIN. Two hands.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. I’m little worried there’s big deal made
 housing market media making big deal it’s going collapse.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 108 196
 
 mention first sentence gotten weaker, there’s counter that, part
 view think there’s stabilization demand, would worry. So, worry little
 saying “nonhousing” don’t enough counter first sentence. first
 read this, one reaction follow KISS principle; worried bit
 changed previous statement said problem housing.
 right came back said, “Yes, think it’s going work okay
 end.” there’s little tension worries saying “nonhousing,” may spook
 markets bit.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole?
 MR. POOLE. would also point that, people may read “economy” GDP.
 take housing out, rest GDP. way stated bit tautology. think
 simplest thing change “still” “nevertheless.” “Nevertheless, economy seems likely
 continue expand moderate pace,” leave that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. think that’s we’re heading. Vince.
 MR. REINHART. First, I’d like thank everyone validating career decision.
 [Laughter] Second, description use word “fundamentals,” might
 substitute “financial conditions.” could say “supported still-favorable fundamentals,
 including gains income waning correction housing market.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. similar Governor Kohn suggested. got
 sense time wasn’t well received. right, think we’re going come
 conclusion. think need accept President Minehan’s suggestion.

 Let go list questions. Obviously, don’t think answer number 1
 huge surprise. [Laughter] interesting discussion would created
 different, clearly believe numerical price objective important. reasons
 ones I’ve discussed before. briefly, think clarifies communication
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 public, markets, politicians. increases transparency accountability,
 think key issue central banks. Also, numerical objective would actually improve
 clarity, improved clarity, discussions monetary policy inside central banks.
 think would help context FOMC well. reason think would
 would lead naturally discussions policy terms appropriate inflation paths.
 way modern monetary policy analysis indicates appropriate us think

 think numerical price objective would make discussion even clearer.
 discussions inside, point numerical objective would go outside. There’s
 issue transparency here. we’re going clarify make policy inside we’re
 telling public we’re it, point leak out. look foolish
 though transparent, think also problem.
 always issues. devil details, that’s really questions
 dealing with. like think principles deal rest
 questions. numerical inflation objective three important features. First,
 objective needs absolutely clearly consistent dual mandate. That’s also
 important politically, strongly believe dual mandate, make sure
 that’s case. Financial stability concerns, though might consider somewhat
 separate, part dual mandate and, such, clearly key this. Second,
 objective easy communicate clearly public, something
 President Fisher pointed out. Third, objective needs evolutionary want
 build successes would politically palatable. three
 features, way, actually important terms political process, terms

 talking public conducting policy, terms helping
 confidence it.
 Regarding questions, want start question 4, think question—
 issue appropriate time horizon—is critical thinking questions.
 first part question ask kind things might affect time horizon.
 reality time horizon lot variability. science monetary policy,
 economics learned years terms best way monetary
 policy, says that, fact, horizon going change depending far away
 ultimate goal currently, kind shocks you’ve had, whether shocks
 temporary permanent, big output gaps project are, then, clearly,
 financial stability issues are. get shocks financial markets, worry
 them. thinking minimum time horizon going two years that’s
 effectively policy period. horizon could substantially longer that, think
 extremely important design big impact issue dual
 mandate. think it’s absolutely critical make clear horizon would sometimes
 quite long. fact, political viewpoint extremely important
 indicating horizon could sometimes quite long actually indicating
 care output fluctuations, key element dual mandate. Politically
 also important makes clear would unwilling beat economy
 head baseball bat order get inflation quickly. Again, indicates
 care output fluctuations. lean toward precise horizon but,
 instead, indicating objectives achieved long run sort average

 comfortable language.
 Let deal issues, don’t strong views on,
 give different sides. issue price index, really don’t strong views.
 It’s really six one half dozen other. lean slightly toward CPI
 readily understood public. It’s reported every month. might even
 advantage never revised. R&S document actually changed view
 think quite right policy viewpoint doesn’t really matter.
 issue revision occurs is, example, upward, may look though
 didn’t good job fact, information had, best job
 possible. lack revision bit political advantage, although advantage
 view actually policy. think you’re quite right regard.
 advantage PCE index? advantage continuity, fits evolutionary
 element talked about. also slight advantages technical basis; however, they’re
 big used be. Fed went PCE instead CPI talking
 inflation numbers looking, necessary would
 now. bottom line I’m willing go whatever people willing go
 this, slight preference CPI.
 headline versus core? problems core measure
 following viewpoint: really one right measure core, theory change
 telling us be. Also, regarding issue whether core
 permanent trend elements, let give case example might shifting.
 Usually think food prices temporary drought,
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 125 196
 
 anchovies leaving coast Brazil, something like that. think case ethanol
 right now: There’s push ethanol production. tell you, think bad
 piece public policy. However, could permanent effects. I’m sorry, Tom, it’s going
 help District.
 MR. HOENIG. No, won’t. [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. don’t think it’s good idea. may much permanent
 consequences food prices. Then, necessarily exclude food core when,
 fact, it’s permanent shock? case, think issues. Another critical issue
 relates horizon. think horizon long precisely defined,
 difference core headline becomes much less important because, long run,
 number shoot core shooting number
 headline. context, makes sense use headline measure, core measure.
 However, policy discussions need continue refer core, particularly
 regard shocks recent episode energy. fact, central banks
 successfully done so. think International Finance document talks lot Canada
 they’ve done exactly way.
 question 3, point goal range, time horizon critical. fixed
 period evaluation, question range makes lot sense. nicely
 shows care uncertainty. recently wrote academic paper shows
 range nice properties terms appropriate objective function get
 behavior central bank, it’s clear you’d shooting midpoint
 there’s uncertainty around it. problem that, take view horizon
 potentially long fixed, talking range creates confusion. range

 looks like zone indifference. took number 1 2 comfort zone
 range, would 1.9 okay relative 1.5? purpose talking numerical
 inflation objective clarity, think range would mistake. also could mean
 inflation expectations would less grounded. inflation goes 1.9 versus 1.5, people
 might move inflation expectations up. Again, would losing one key
 benefits numerical inflation objective. One thing document—
 shouldn’t put it’s private communication, can—is issue
 Australia. Australia one countries “comfort zone” range. call thick
 point, talk number cycle. hasn’t disaster, huge
 deal. officials said, “You know, started process little differently”—
 convince governor, particularly enthusiastic initially
 inflation targeting used thick point—“it would better picked
 number.” think discomfort. research scientific—it comes
 sitting beer pub—but think experience argues point
 target.
 issue level? Again, important. point
 perspective reflects views way economy works way expectations work.
 strongly believe announcing objective substantially change inflation
 expectations. Chairman participated writing book topic. looked
 adoption inflation targeting many countries, evidence change
 inflation expectations immediately. fact, expectations anchored time

 Let tell one downside think serious think
 about. downside 2 percent PCE objective (or CPI equivalent, appropriately

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure.
 MR. LACKER. try clarify views, Governor Mishkin—if inflation 4

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.

 I’ve disagreeing all.
 However, looking benefits costs adopting numerical inflation objective,
 believe practical benefits relatively small time costs relatively larger

 Now, go forward, come terms numerical objective?
 would go core PCE core CPI. Despite general superiority PCE,

 economic projections provided Vince’s memo good useful, think go

 important convey uncertainty surrounding forecast, would combine

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank much. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d also like lend voice vote
 thanks staff thought excellent set memos. think staff
 outstanding job summarizing lot nuances details involved.
 Perhaps comes surprise I’m favor defining Committee’s price
 objective numerically announcing goal public. believe specifying longrun price stability objective numerically would focus policy discussions help anchor
 expectations. reducing public’s uncertainty goal, long-run expectations would
 become less responsive changes short-run inflation. help enhance monetary
 policy’s flexibility respond economic shocks may deem appropriate. Thus, rather
 unduly constraining, believe would actually add flexibility. way, it’s
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 134 196
 
 consistent goals monetary policy increases monetary policy effectiveness.
 would also increase social welfare extent helps us avoid time-inconsistent policy,
 since know welfare commitment generally exceeds welfare discretion
 agents forward looking. Thus, believe numerical goal would long-run anchor
 monetary policy help coordinate discussions appropriate policy might be.
 Now, Vince laid questions, make number decisions making
 numerical goal operational. feel strongly aspects design
 others, many choices interrelated. example, long horizon mean
 tighter control range. long horizon makes choice headline core less
 important. long horizon makes choice core fact less compelling. think
 proposals pros cons. said, I’m necessarily wedded
 particulars, make proposal. let emphatically stress
 important specifics agree numerical objective horizon
 achievement.
 Regarding price index, prefer headline CPI even though it’s likely
 harder control forecast short run core. Many foreign central banks
 experience tended move toward headline CPI number, indicating fact
 work. headline CPI measure that’s understood public,
 communication arguments important here. Unlike PCE, mentioned couple
 times, GDP deflator, CPI revised, helps us assessing
 accountability reaching goal. also prefer headline core goal don’t
 want convey idea insensitive wider array prices influence
 behavior—particularly because, Governor Mishkin indicated, stochastic processes
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 135 196
 
 properties individual elements CPI may change time. started defining
 subset prices, could find trouble. think would also opportunity
 use core communications explaining might might react
 policy temporary blip headline inflation. view focusing headline using core
 purposes means enhancing communication efforts. Again, practice
 similar practices central banks announce inflation goals. course,
 think it’s going terribly important us consider respond
 communicate inevitable misses target.
 Regarding point goal range, strongly favor announcing point goal. reality,
 range around point reflects precision policymakers think
 control inflation, control range differ depending inflation measure used
 time horizon selected. However, I’m reluctant announce range part
 inflation goal think would difficult ensure public would
 interpret range indifferent. headline CPI, would specify
 announce target 1 percent. That’s consistent goal price stability
 estimated measurement bias CPI something slightly less 1 percent. picked
 1 percent take seriously mandate price stability. Since believe
 long-run tradeoff inflation employment, reason seek

 ability economy’s ability deal issues, deflation zero bounds.
 accept people may concern do.
 Regarding time horizons, feel strongly specify time horizon
 think achieve target held accountable meeting missing
 goal. Since favor using headline CPI, little difficult control,
 volatile, core measure, think two-year horizon would appropriate and, indeed,
 achievable given typical shocks hit economy volatility CPI.
 example, past ten years, standard deviation monthly twenty-four-month CPI
 headline inflation rate 0.5 percent. could also make case initially
 may want consider slightly longer horizon, especially choose number like 1 percent
 given currently well 2 percent. Specifying longer horizon first may
 provide markets opportunity adjust new regime mitigate
 transition costs. converge target, might able shorten horizon. much
 prefer idea adjusting goal. think goal ought goal, use
 horizon give us flexibility, depending initial conditions also perhaps
 future discussions nature shocks may cause us that. don’t like idea
 picking optimal target simply we’re yet. think that’s right

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start way background simply
 saying that, may good theoretical arguments adopting numerical

 ways improve external internal communication accountability. extent
 communication improved, certainly aid decisionmaking within Committee,
 decisionmaking within private sector, communication Congress others

 far question point goal range, proposal, though it’s
 original one. propose say target something less close 2 percent,
 ECB target. Let try explain think that’s good idea. I’d start Governor

 we’re little 2 percent 1½ percent even lower. think little less 2 percent

 far whether Committee participants jointly decide goal, think
 answer “yes.” I’m sure exactly mechanism achieving that; we’d
 probably reaffirm goal every year composition Committee changed,

 methodological grounds, course, I’m enamored things like market-based core PCE,

 FOMC providing PCE price inflation projections Monetary Policy Report since
 February 2000. Many us talking goals terms PCE price index,
 CPI still entrenched minds public measure inflation. That’s
 probably central banks around globe define inflation objectives terms CPI.
 Like others, I’ve also found public quite skeptical, probably rightly so, measures

 argument that, long-run goal, advantage using total rather core
 index. course, refer behavior core index explaining see going
 forward internal deliberations. point, think I’ve changed mind,
 would agree total CPI probably preferred alternative. But, again, don’t feel
 strongly, could go along core PCE.
 regard point value inflation goal range, found interesting
 paper many central banks both. point serves focal point, think
 good reasons, particularly Governor Mishkin emphasized, focal
 point. range seems useful communication device remind public inflation

 Governor Mishkin—suggest welfare function pretty flat range possible

 zero bound seems prudent. also worry adverse interaction downward nominal

 However, also nothing gained setting goal higher inflation
 expectations currently anchored. remain comfortable goal enunciated
 time ago—a long-run inflation objective 1½ percent core PCE inflation rate. agree
 Governor Mishkin take transition costs account. It’s question
 weighing gains better number transition costs, thought
 tradeoff decided 1½. know we’re there, guess decided
 tradeoff worth making. don’t way want say case compelling,
 could certainly continue live number. cast terms overall CPI, think
 comparable number, given average measurement bias, would 2 percent.
 first FOMC discussion topic participated in, January 1996, came

 I’d emphasize 2 percent goal CPI stress FOMC would indifferent

 Turning forecast narrative, strongly support proposed experiment.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. suppose comes surprise anybody
 table listening discussions past—it seems like forever
 guess couple years [laughter]—that I’m favor numerical price

 believe benefits outweigh costs, find agreement lot

 found material disseminated meeting useful. would liked bit
 time look it, useful thinking, particularly Vince’s
 encouragement, implicit explicit, think one’s personal definition price stability.
 bit—I thought definition opposed whether favor

 qualitative quantitative. It’s rate inflation, price level, that’s low stable
 doesn’t interfere decisionmaking businesses invest consumers save plan
 future. Achieving rate inflation meets sort definition best
 central bank long run achieve objectives—that is, price stability
 maximum sustainable growth—and (I would take Governor Mishkin’s thinking this)
 environment financial stability. know definition sounds simplistic; certainly isn’t
 original. think effectively conveys challenges face strive meet

 recognize, however, even context qualitative definition price stability,
 quantification useful one thinks current progress. regard, things
 equal, would worry rates inflation 3 percent. Similarly, rates 1 percent
 seem carry potential instability certainly lot concern around table,
 saw 2003 President Stern mentioned. Based research I’ve seen, think
 hard distinguish benefits 2½ versus 2¼ 2 1½ versus 2½. think experience
 years I’ve Committee suggests 1-to-3 range pretty good definition,
 least time being, means stable prices. doubts

 whether there’s single optimum inflation rate. think things change, chose
 particular number optimum inflation rate, might cause us fail appreciate evolution
 way economy works exercise judgment.
 think judgment important policy formation. It’s important exercise
 judgment right policy timely way, I’m afraid stating particular number
 optimum inflation rate would end making us numbers-determined less judgmentdetermined, think would step backward terms policy formation. although
 notion constitutes stable prices useful policymaker, think it’s
 important seen determinant policy action. One reason explicit
 price stability thought useful shape market expectations. price
 stability isn’t goal. Maximum sustainable growth goal well. short run,
 tradeoffs two. Markets need know short-run policy always
 balancing act. tell that, action setting numerical inflation target speak
 louder words. say value one goal other. material prepared
 meeting points well, benefits numerical target need weighed
 potential harm. Communication transparency may seem improved, confusion
 could created well, confusion could extend public Congress,
 would difficult time time. Now, know meet concerns. know
 wide array ways communicate. know given many, many
 words written subject many ways make clear
 tradeoffs go choosing particular objective. wonder, along President Fisher,
 want spend time political capital right anytime near future
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 ensure we’re conveying subtleties inflation target. don’t see spending time
 political capital brings us enough advantage.
 Neither market public needs told number believe seek low
 stable rates inflation. credibility comes long period success

 do. Obviously, didn’t success start inflation
 control process, like Brazil Mexico perhaps points time past, could benefit
 establishing target. Even we’d right follow-up policy actions results
 target wouldn’t credible. track record central bank proves commitment
 low stable rates inflation shows we’re accountable actions.
 commitment accountability work shape expectations and, combined sound policy,
 would keep inflation low stable future. end, shape best environment
 saving, investing, long-term growth.
 Now, it’s clear, known along—only us think along
 lines, maybe nobody thinks along lines do. let focus
 answers perspective questions posed. individual, believe
 Committee’s price objectives defined numerically? No. think benefits
 could outweighed potential harm. it, may happen,
 preferred price index? Well, mine unlike Janet others: come
 side headline CPI; think encompasses range costs important
 people. Food important people. Energy important people. Conveying concerns
 inflation really needs done terms headline number, would pick headline CPI.
 I’m also favor fairly long maybe flexible time horizon. two work together.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 152 196
 
 pick headline number longish period, headline number isn’t volatile
 short period. something focus longish period time goal that’s
 easily understood, easily communicated, reached longish period.
 point goal range? mentioned earlier, I’m less comfortable
 right inflation goal range 1 3 percent. terms range

 set store stability time. Like rest you, I’d worried we’re

 try manage tradeoffs way. think you’ll shaping expectations that,

 group, Committee participants arrive consensus view goal?
 arrive view, don’t think consensus view necessary. might undermine diversity
 viewpoint think strength Committee. consensus view arrived
 either formally informally, would communicated public. regard
 next question—participants surveyed regarding preferred level numerical
 objective—I think sort we’re now. It’s probably helpful internal
 communication know everybody else stands know stand—it’s
 beneficial information flow around Committee. survey participants done
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 153 196
 
 way useful developing policy communicating among ourselves, think would
 helpful. it’s done way tries force consensus, I’m sure would useful.
 discussion public transcript. fact we’re discussion
 us feels price stability made public. I’m comfortable public
 transcript. Whatever summary done minutes probably good enough unless
 come decision going numerical price objective, case
 public would minutes might even subject
 communication.
 think trial run interesting. I’m favor providing information
 trial run May. hard time seeing forecast narrative, particularly
 minutes-style format like draft Vince sent us, two weeks minutes three
 weeks. think trial run going useful showing us feels. may suggest
 minutes two weeks incorporate narrative minutes. we’ll see
 trial run goes.
 also want counted camp people worry range uncertainty,
 fan charts. think they’re hard describe. looking at, example, confidence
 intervals around GDP—our central tendency slightly 3 percent ’08, 90
 percent confidence interval somewhere zero 6. don’t know public makes
 that, don’t know anything credibility explicitly identifying
 range uncertainty short period. doubt math beautiful
 correct. think that, communication device, chart really deficient. need think
 convey uncertainty, certainly have, way helpful hurtful.

 MR. LOCKHART. president three weeks, hope still get away
 tentative preliminary remarks subject. really two questions.
 first question whether go forward, second is, go forward,
 implement it. Regarding first question, today privy discussions, I’m
 going make mind quite yet. would like make comments “how”
 side question event go forward.
 First, favor quantitative price objective. whether explicit objective
 whether point goal range, see pros cons both. point goal help
 influencing long-term inflation expectations, indifference range compatible
 dual mandate. balance, favor point goal comfortable bands. Regarding exact
 numbers, I’ve settled specific number, would think something range
 1½ 2 percent, depending upon index that’s chosen, reasonable guide policy
 compatible dual mandate. preferred price index, I’ve influenced
 discussion today. starting point core PCE based upon consistency past. I’m
 convinced overall measure makes sense consistent
 pocketbook experience public, since we’re communicating broad public. would
 favor one overall measures. I’d like stress much favor approach
 minimizes political risk conflict Congress dilution principle central

 work best, especially initial stage.
 believe flexibility going policy sensible important. I’ve thought bit

 many domestic international uncertainties, think flexible enough
 high confidence we’ll achieve stated objectives. Foreign central banks changed
 details implementation inflation targeting—such changes apparently affected
 credibility—and believe FOMC able thing. Finally, believe
 that, inflation targeting effective, goals communicated substantial

 communication degree unity part Committee. Mr. Chairman, let
 end there. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank much. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think that, yes, ought define Committee

 small: clearer discussions; protection cumulating changes inflation either
 down—under one successors, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter] think there’s confusion
 many FOMC participants enunciated 1 2 percent comfort zones. People
 assume that’s Committee’s target. It’s mine. Committee never voted it.
 think need clarify fact, frankly, hope don’t come quite 1 2 percent
 core PCE comfort zones are.

 may net benefits establishing objective, I’m yet convinced gains.
 Maybe even important, would prefer implement final decision numerical

 stepping message focus. There’s lot capital markets
 swallow, particularly many people around room described they’re trying
 achieve. feel though projections would become relegated back burner public

 I’m also worried timing rollout. It’s easy say would rather

 unable accomplish properly, whereas think gains made taking

 March 20-21, 2007
 
 164 196
 
 Regarding question whether point range, answer perhaps
 practical. think ranges—for example, we’ve given economic projections—have
 broadly misinterpreted markets. look monetary policy testimonies let’s
 say, purposes exposition, forecasts central tendency 2
 3 percent, range gets reported, think understood FOMC’s belief
 economy grow 2 3 percent next year, quite different statements
 we’ve made. is, different uncertainty bands around projections,

 you’re going seek consensus participants this, voting members.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.
 MR. MOSKOW. guess advantage maybe disadvantage going near
 end. think hearing discussion advantage, though. I’m reminded famous term
 Alan Greenspan used—“conundrum”—and view kind conundrum. dual
 mandate legislation price stability maximum employment maximum output,
 heart hearts, believe really influence one long term—the

 price stability objective. also believe influencing objective helps us achieve longerterm objective maximum employment maximum output well. set firm quantitative
 guidelines price stability—and I’ll define “firm” later—we’re going pushed inevitably
 type quantitative guidelines output. consideration leads position
 “Well, let’s set firm quantitative target price stability. Let’s make looser. Let’s
 make flexible.” There’s sense least people spoken today.
 then, course, looser make it, flexible, claimed benefits
 decrease result. less anchor inflation. less accountability
 discipline. less transparency less facilitation internal external
 communications, claimed benefits it.
 want say clearly favor policies consistent low stable inflation,
 think we’ve done pretty good job far look back Volcker years, Greenspan
 years, Bernanke years. I’m still convinced quantitative goal
 inflation time. It’s huge decision. sets us road think can’t reverse.
 don’t see overriding reason I’ve listened discussion. I’ve heard phrases
 “it’s difficult quantify benefits”; “the benefits enormous”; “the benefits small”;
 “it’s close call.” people least believe it’s close call, policy working well now,
 it? think risky. Tom talked unintended consequences. Kevin referred
 avoiding corner grid, agree completely. would proceed cautiously
 this.
 I, too, started question 4 because, given dual mandate, think time frame is,
 sense, important target. Someone said need specify time horizon
 held accountable, agree statement. what’s accountability
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 167 196
 
 part dual mandate? Wouldn’t someone say it’s appropriate held accountable
 part dual mandate? thought brings back conundrum mentioned
 before. two-year time frame inevitably raises issue dual mandate, short
 time frame doesn’t give proper respect dual mandate either. I’m comfortable using
 medium term, central banks used. think business cycle better.
 prefer time frame, I’d comfortable terminology Kevin had,
 would work direction well.
 Getting back particular points, index would prefer? I’ve talked
 publicly comfort zone 1 2 percent core PCE, long time frame says let’s go
 overall measure overall core time. would shift
 overall measure; understandable. see arguments PCE CPI. think
 that’s second-order question talk decide whether go overall core.
 Whether take point goal range—again, going long time frame pushes toward
 point, toward range. Someone threw range 1 3 percent range around that. get
 nervous wider range gets consideration whether zone
 indifference. indifferent point within range? someone said, “Let’s
 point,” we’d brackets around would give people idea we’re
 comfortable within brackets. then, there’s shock go outside

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank much. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you. Since lunch looming, I’ll try brief possible.
 key hope trying achieve better credibility make monetary policy
 effective fulfill dual mandate better. much agree President Poole’s
 comments it’s valuable make sure insurance mistakes. actually
 fits well risk-management framework Governor Kohn articulated. That’s
 see potentially valuable this. think value along lines President
 
 March 20-21, 2007

 Stern discussed terms internal external accountability articulation.
 seen context broader risk-management policy helps us fulfill dual mandate.
 That’s would support moving direction, although I’m also one people see
 it’s somewhat close call. One make good argument value
 insurance, hard quantify things.
 respect particular price index, supposedly people familiarity
 headline CPI core measures PCE. I’m sure real world people
 know much differences among various inflation measures. talk headline
 CPI. look headlines inflation, don’t think distinctions core
 CPI PCE well known. part uncertainty part. don’t understand
 exact nature expectations process expectations affect behavior. Ultimately
 want enhance credibility make monetary policy effective. lean
 toward core PCE seems bit better correlated future paths inflation,
 although long run they’re highly correlated. Core PCE seems bit better
 behaved. credibility approach also affects behavior expectations,
 concern deviate stated objective, either temporarily long run,
 less objective taken seriously. times Chairman go Congress
 say, “Well, know, objective 2 special circumstances
 transitory part there,” seems odds getting objective enhancing credibility.
 Now, may wrong. may people really familiar CPI, that’s thing
 focus on. I’m convinced think know little people’s
 expectations, development process, behavior process. think it’s general
 credibility—that it’s clear Fed tried ensure inflation doesn’t stray particular
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 170 196
 
 range away particular point. That’s message, achieve it. think that’s
 best way us achieve dual mandate.
 third question, whether point range, answer “no.” want something
 between, much President Stern articulated—perhaps something like
 2 percent much 2 percent, something like European Central Bank does—
 better range reason many people said also nice
 little flexibility. specification doesn’t explicitly articulate range, gives us
 flexibility keeps us away zero point. don’t see lot welfare benefits going
 much that, don’t see lot welfare benefits moving dramatically
 now, best situation means terrible situation.
 respect horizon, flexibility better. fits risk-management
 approach. push comes shove, say number, I’d say something like three years plus
 minus year. think would better say intermediate term long run
 business cycle term gives us flexibility respond shocks. like President
 Pianalto’s approach set forget it. Unfortunately, practice difficult

 comfortable members FOMC, least foreseeable future, would comfortable

 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin, two-hander?
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 171 196
 
 MR. MISHKIN. Yes. Actually it’s issue concerning information perhaps
 Karen provide us. ECB used “less 2 percent close,” way find
 attractive. worry. know academics quite critical
 articulation target little waffley. don’t know that’s really accurate not. Karen,
 feel reaction been? Maybe people general bit
 concerned ECB’s communication strategy. may second-pillar
 issue. problem regard?
 MS. JOHNSON. Well, complex. would say “yes.” three things. First,
 people find statement Rube Goldberg-ish. seems odd say less 2 percent
 close somehow, right? mean 1.9 percent, don’t say 1.9? Certainly criticism
 directed especially. Second, fact ECB hasn’t achieved it. back page,
 look 2 percent line, you’ll see seldom ever achieve it. hasn’t
 helped communication piece. Third, general ECB communication problems. can’t
 sort three, would say sense people still see expressing way
 weak point.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Initially began 2 percent clarified
 below, far below; created least sense floor.
 MR. MISHKIN. issue arose ECB, too, regard whole
 big review—similar one we’re doing—and came something
 considered Rube Goldberg-ish.

 they’re conducting policy, say 1.9?
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 173 196
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman, floor absolutely. [Laughter]
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think three things
 current regime worth reflecting whether improve them. are, first, lack
 clarity exists define objective; second, relative lack texture
 provide outlook risks underpin decisions relative central
 banks; third, way run internal conversation. areas, institutions
 subject inertia, we’re probably short frontier achievable, think it’s worth
 thinking whether get closer frontier. want raise questions
 think hardest us work figuring evolve—and think
 evolve.
 first issue balance benefits regime costs.
 problem face that, based know theory experience, gains
 expectations relative already achieved central bank look pretty small. think
 there’s broad consensus they’re small. There’s greater dispersion views
 costs are. transition costs—how get you’re going political
 issues surround that. costs uncertainty effect
 operate going forward. difficulty judging balance think know
 potential gains costs it’s hard narrow uncertainty around costs even
 looking experience central banks. many people said, experience
 central banks pretty reassuring costs. It’s hard argue worse
 achieved terms outcomes. uncertainty difficult narrow ex
 ante, lot depend judgments make design regime.
 even judgments won’t fully answer questions because, even tied now,
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 174 196
 
 would still leave uncertainty effect incentives, behavior,
 management regime much exacting demands communication.
 problem magnified fact hard us adopt regime explicit,
 fixed, relatively short horizon justify consistent dual mandate
 politics surround that, also—based know experience central
 banks—with making sensible decisions monetary policy multiple objectives
 time. don’t think outcome realistic us Committee. Therefore, you’re talking
 range options much toward softer end—no fixed horizon, horizon varies
 according circumstances. gains going look tenuous. That’s one issue
 think interesting us think through.
 second issue concerns initial conditions transition costs. you’re going
 adopt objective that’s different people think objective different
 best estimates trend core inflation trend inflation today, conditions costs
 complicated. dialogue Rick Jeff interesting. choices exist
 today, going launch today, look unattractive. basically decide
 pick target that’s pretty close judgment trend slightly
 market infers objective is. validate higher objective
 inferring awkward hard see. would easy say you’re going adopt
 objective substantially lower believe would easy us make simple,
 compelling political endeavor achieve. think issues timing, initial conditions,
 transition costs important complicated work through. thought nice
 job laying obvious issues sides.
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 175 196
 
 third issue think interesting question strength consensus
 necessary go forward deal it. think you’d need strong consensus go
 forward. would view change regime Fed significant since
 Humphrey-Hawkins, maybe since well Humphrey-Hawkins, you’d want
 strong consensus. decide, strength consensus, better move
 forward. agreement. People agree they’re going operate
 regime, think will, effect, need bind successors operate within regime.
 Even regime which, legal practical circumstances surrounding
 institution, periodic reaffirmation objective, effect you’re binding
 successors agree can’t go back. can’t contemplate
 possibility we’re going adjust response changing preferences different
 Committees time.
 fourth issue think interesting us design process
 internal deliberation launch allows us get comfortable way would
 operate. aspects internal decisionmaking process least well suited operating
 comfortably variants regime we’ve discussing lack clarity
 live individual preferences are, informs different
 views structure, inform choices appropriate, desirable paths
 inflation, monetary policy think consistent that. we’ve
 discussing, need bring little internal clarity conversation. need know
 we’re disagreeing disagree we’re going better thinking difficult
 choices. also related gap talk stuff today, Kohn said.
 Even talk regime toward may leaning publicly disclose things
 
 March 20-21, 2007
 
 176 196
 
 forecast move direction quantitative definition inflation, we’re going
 explicit conversation think appropriate path slope
 path. Even don’t want adopt fixed horizon varies time embedded
 disclose forecast, we’re going explicit conversations
 think adequate, acceptable path toward trend. complicated
 conversation have, brief experience Committee, haven’t spent much time
 thinking kinds choices. We’d prefer live squishiness, lack definition,
 ambiguity around kinds things easier. don’t think we’d option
 regime we’re moving toward more-frequent disclosure, three-year forecasts, central
 tendency path kinds things. fourth issue need careful
 thinking we’re going get comfortable evolution internal regime that’s
 going necessary live within kinds regimes launch.
 last point is—I’m sure describe this—about stability proposal
 adopt. We’re going tempted soften edges we’re agreeing make
 consensus broad possible. need careful that, adopt intermediate things,
 look think stand pretty well external criticism we’re going
 find uncomfortable moved intermediate position. think we’re going
 get pulled naturally toward clarity. discussion past—for example,
 whether reveal conditioning assumptions forecast—is best example that. That’s
 one instance might decide it’s expedient agree today we’re going
 unstated, undisclosed, appropriate policy conditioning assumption forecast
 clarity. time, we’ve seen cases, there’s going lot pressure say, “But
 tell us really? don’t really understand this.” want think

 think sometimes leads somewhat confusing outcomes. someone,
 example, pessimistic inflation actually go low inflation target

 inflation going go. would like put consideration, since we’re going
