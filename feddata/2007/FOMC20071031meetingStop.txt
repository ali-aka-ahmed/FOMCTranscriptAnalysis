 Two market developments deserve brief mention turn dealer

 First, crude oil prices shot higher. considerable disagreement among

 crack spread implies increases crude oil prices, forthcoming, would
 likely feed product prices. Second, dollar continues gradual
 downward course. Although dollar reached new lows euro
 Canadian dollar, overall pace decline measured broad tradeweighted index changed much trend exhibited earlier year (see
 exhibit 17). dollar’s trajectory still appears driven mainly interest rate
 differentials. seen exhibit 18, shows dollar versus euro

 mind, recent developments raise three big questions forecast.
 First, broad-based strength seen data spending

 Let start question whether strength incoming data casts

 little denying that, almost across board, readings economic activity

 So, fairly broad-based upward surprises spending activity suggest

 However, think would premature make call. Bill noted, financial

 actually slowing terms percentage growth year year. guess way would put
 is, extent lower growth imports really driven lower aggregate consumption
 rather genuine improvement current account? That’s one question.
 Another question really quite separate, think tie later go-round here.

 MR. SHEETS. response first question, think answer it’s
 improvement net export contribution current account that’s driven
 strengthening exports softening imports. net export contribution direct
 contribution exports GDP growth risen roughly 25 basis points past couple
 years—so ¼ percentage point. token, arithmetic negative drag imports
 reduced 40 basis points. think it’s strictly arithmetic computational thing.
 observation it’s imports exports absolutely right, comparing 2007
 several years ago. certainly third quarter second half, exports
 extraordinarily strong, imports softer maybe couple years ago
 extraordinarily weak. near term, it’s export story. point
 certainly you’re also correct softening imports we’ve seen past years

 don’t exact decomposition here—on order two-thirds softening imports.

 However, labor market remains reasonably solid, support consumer spending.
 Anecdotal information consumer spending unusually mixed. saw evidence

 Investment, including investment commercial real estate, may also slowing somewhat;
 again, evidence mixed. Manufacturing growth appears moderating. sectors—

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everybody. Let’s start Dave Stockton,
 bring us date overnight data releases.
 MR. STOCKTON. 3 left place—and hope find—a table showing
 GDP release numbers relative Greenbook forecast had. thought would start

 downside—just tenth—by final sales. real area surprise release, look
 table level chained 2000 dollars, change nonfarm
 inventories. BEA much higher estimate third-quarter inventory investment
 do. Typically change doesn’t carry great many implications us going forward.
 anything, hold inventory investment level projected fourth quarter,
 higher level estimating third quarter would actually lead reduction
 estimate fourth-quarter GDP.
 Going back briefly components final sales, see, two areas explain
 small downside surprise final sales. Personal consumption came
 3 percent versus 3.2 percent estimating, equipment software expenditures
 came 5.9 percent versus 7.4 percent estimating. One area came
 bit expectations net exports, “level” area. Nathan
 tells folks would inclined take lower estimate, would
 probably carrying slightly higher number net exports going forward.

 might have, best answer them.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions Dave? President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, wanted ask—and question based
 ignorance—you’ve talked nonresidential structures, mentioned drilling
 mining. One thing impressed talking bigger logistics companies—
 Fluor, Bechtel, Zachry—are enormous numbers mentioned earlier—the
 infrastructure developments Gulf Coast area somewhat heartland, think
 way President Hoenig’s District. numbers quite large, continue surge.
 Would part nonresidential structure investment number?
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 80 162
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Yes, would part nonresidential structure
 figure. since don’t know exactly proprietary information BEA has, I’m
 quite sure included number. conceptually, there.
 MR. FISHER. weight construction mining what?
 MR. STOCKTON. Drilling mining overall economy small.
 MR. FISHER. Yes, that’s thought.
 MR. STOCKTON. mean, nonresidential structures contribute 3½ percent;
 drilling mining could get you.
 MR. FISHER. think two combined something like that.
 MR. STOCKTON. Yes, it’s small piece.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions Dave? President Rosengren?
 MR. ROSENGREN. follow-up question nonresidential structures. talked
 drilling mining, wondering parts commercial real estate.
 anything there? don’t know chance look it, reason ask that,
 thought financing starting become problem weak
 nonresidential investment going forward, would expect start seeing there. I’m
 wondering anything breakout.
 second question, didn’t mention durable goods.
 thought credit problems, particularly subprime things, starting create
 issues, would expect start seeing imprints data durable goods.
 seeing durable goods little stronger consumption figures surprise all?

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Brian?
 MR. MADIGAN. Mr. Chairman, would like take opportunity remind

 MR. MADIGAN. 4 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. referring package
 labeled “Material FOMC Briefing Monetary Policy Alternatives.”
 package includes two versions table 1: first version discussed
 Bluebook, second revised version dated October 31. revised

 changes rationale risk assessment sections. review, alternatives B

 Dave Stockton discussed yesterday response question Vice

 concerned downside risks growth, explicitly citing potential effect
 tightening credit conditions. Regarding inflation, language would identical
 used September. statement would conclude indicating that, balance,
 Committee saw downside risks growth greater policy concern.
 Bill Dudley noted, market certain yesterday
 ease policy today 25 basis points. Today, response economic data released
 earlier, intermediate longer-term interest rates risen somewhat; however,
 futures quotes still suggest investors see high odds ease policy
 today. Thus, announcement unchanged stance policy would come
 considerable surprise markets. sure, assessment alternative B
 downside risks greater policy concern implication
 easing might well forthcoming long would soften blow. selloff
 bond equity markets would doubt ensue. Moreover, financial asset prices
 could remain volatile time, investors attempted recalibrate
 expectations probable path monetary policy going forward.
 Concern market reactions clearly would persuade ease
 policy meeting judged unchanged stance policy would likely
 consistent maximum employment stable prices, hitching
 monetary policy market expectations would make extremely poor economic
 outcomes. especially circumstances persisting financial strains, concern
 unnecessarily adding strains might incline bit toward
 easing, alternative A, already strongly leaning way today based
 view economic financial fundamentals. noted yesterday,
 economic projections suggest believe stance policy
 eased within next six twelve months, many indicated
 easing appropriate imminently. may see several reasons preferring
 move earlier rather later. particular, may think timely reduction
 interest rates could valuable buoying household, business, investor
 confidence. Yesterday Chairman noted possibility vicious cycle
 involving deteriorating macroeconomic outlook tightening credit conditions.
 bolstering confidence outlook, easing policy expected could help reduce
 concerns deteriorating economic fundamentals declining asset values.
 Beyond reducing risks nonlinear responses, easing policy expected
 market participants would support growth aggregate demand time
 usual channels.
 course, may also worried possible increase inflation.
 concerns may reflect variety factors—the sharp increase oil prices
 recent weeks, depreciation dollar, accelerating unit labor costs, perhaps
 relatively high level resource utilization. given recent good inflation
 performance, may feel downside risks growth immediate
 danger believe easing today address risks warranted.
 
 October 30-31, 2007

 may also believe that, easing eventually appear unnecessary,
 could act quickly remove stimulus put place.
 inclined toward easing policy another 25 basis points meeting, would need
 confront question appropriate statement language. versions
 alternative A, first two sentences section 2 similar proposed
 alternative B. rather emphasizing remaining downside risks, statement
 would repeat “help forestall” language used September.
 language proposed inflation paragraph versions identical
 corresponding paragraph suggested alternative B; again, language shown
 October 31 version suggests bit concern inflation risks
 September language. Finally, versions alternative would characterize
 upside risks inflation roughly balancing downside risks growth.
 indication might well lead market participants reduce nearly two-thirds odds
 currently place another quarter-point easing December might trim
 extent overall easing policy anticipated next year so. Thus,
 implementation alternative also could prompt backup market
 interest rates.
 closing, let remind Committee September trial run highlighted
 potential inconsistencies results projections survey
 Committee’s statement. latest forecast submissions indicated that,
 minority sees risks inflation skewed upside, slight majority
 perceives risks total inflation broadly balanced, more-sizable majority
 judges risks core inflation balance. results could seen
 incongruent draft statements alternatives. example,
 alternative references upside risks inflation. Several considerations might
 explain apparent inconsistency. example, responses skews
 projections survey may capture subjective probabilities attach
 various outcomes, may see statement language capturing
 odds also economic costs associated outcomes. perhaps
 upside risks inflation referenced statement interpreted reflecting
 views members majority saw inflation risks balanced,
 thus encompassing views minority see upside inflation risks.
 Finally, worried possibility may provided

 MR. STERN. Well, don’t know. look language last meeting,

 MR. POOLE. two comments. Brian talked skewness, gather
 going describe words use histogram. following question
 skewness. one said “broadly similar,” here’s would look it.
 start point estimate. Let’s make simple—next year, fourth quarter fourth quarter.
 ask far would move point estimate probability
 right left would same. amount would move
 point estimate fraction standard error, would interpret it, roughly speaking,
 symmetrical risks. suspicion people talking “weighted
 downside” way mixing first moment third moment probability
 
 October 30-31, 2007

 distribution. worry that, think Brian worrying, give message that’s
 going interfere communication also want offer policy path. That’s
 best way think it—to ask far would move point estimate
 make probability right left roughly same. would also note Greenbook,
 example, reduced point estimate next year ¾ percentage point June now,
 roughly speaking. Maybe even ask Dave whether thinks distribution around
 current point estimate skewed, could also go ask far would
 move point estimate make probability right left same.
 point want make—and really many ways much important
 point—is that, disclose 2010 inflation projection presumably, Mr. Chairman,
 February monetary policy hearings—assuming member Congress actually asks
 question related monetary policy, given—[laughter] logical question either
 sometime future would personally stand, number
 projection. would much like know answer advance would
 happy conform estimate, regard target, number would throw out.
 think there’s issue here. inflation projection 2010 varies roughly 1.5 2,
 numbers materially different, think question going come back us
 again. won’t say that, believe would hate position
 explain number different yours.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, let say first mode median, make
 good point first issue risks. question ask is, Given likely
 forecast, side largest costly deviations likely occur.
 direction risks skewed? way think it.
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 133 162
 
 MR. POOLE. Well, would keep separate cost distribution itself.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, don’t think so. think ought put costs—
 MR. POOLE. I’m saying would ignore costs, maybe need clear
 probability distribution supposed mean. thought supposed mean
 simply weights would give various possible outcomes terms probability
 forecast might 1 percentage point 1 percentage point central tendency,
 however described it. Now, agree full analysis requires also add costs those,
 would interpret part projections process GDP inflation
 rather you’d fold policy decision weight various possible
 outcomes. interpreted along really statement probability
 distribution outcomes unweighted severity outcome.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. think answer would pretty similar either
 case. discuss another time. second question, think I’m kind special
 case people overweight say give number. would give number,
 would say matters views broad Committee, don’t want
 distinguish broad Committee. Committee decision process. individuals
 want give numbers, suppose that’s okay. would urge consider externality
 bit, desire figure distribution order
 assess holding type policy preference on. Certainly many us
 often given views price stability on. don’t think want prohibit that,
 recommendation would little fuzzy, bit careful precise sharp
 number.
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 134 162
 
 MR. POOLE. Well, won’t really matter much
 long, long record bringing number down, can’t back
 that. That’s believe, I’m going keep that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That’s fine.
 MR. POOLE. I’ll disappear calculus next spring anyway.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, appreciate answer. one worry
 exercise, much better way expressed presented—I think ready
 prime time—is might divided individual instincts. operate
 Committee. said million times, I’d like reiterate it. it’s last bastion

 October 30-31, 2007
 
 135 162
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. want come back President Poole’s question.
 President Poole, said fraction standard error. large fraction standard error
 would want use basis? Really, I’m sure standard error context.
 terms think this, large fraction standard error?
 MR. POOLE. Well, one put B—that distribution
 skewness broadly similar past twenty years. came way. trying
 offer way think issue and, believe probability distribution
 way one side, way think it: far would move point
 estimate? wasn’t trying give answer; trying give way approach question.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, maybe clarify one
 point. leave question about—I don’t know chart called; going
 addendum minutes—what bars show balance risk?
 probability outcome probability outcome costs
 consequences outcome?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. May ask staff, institutional memory
 question?
 MR. MADIGAN. sure question exactly. question?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. skew determines risks simply probability
 outcomes, probability weighted cost certain outcomes?
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, think matter members interpreted
 responding. [Laughter] memorandum Committee asks whether risks around
 projection variable weighted upside, weighted downside, broadly
 balanced.
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 136 162
 
 MR. KOHN. think balance risk statement announcement utility
 weight it; times Committee concerned falling
 one side another. least interpreted forecast simply whether skews
 one side another. may floor talk bit President Poole’s point. think
 say statement upside risks inflation downside risks growth.
 would concerned whole Committee shifted middle think would
 contradicting announcement made, think point good. mean,
 ought sure really think downside risk growth upside risk
 inflation, whatever, adjust policy choice made today.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. utility cost relevant statement, can’t
 take balance risks unless compare terms cost. metric
 compare them. case, cost-weighted. think
 less equivalent—the univariate answers giving mode versus median.
 MR. POOLE. view projections statement
 probability distribution various outcomes, might important point
 explain speech give whole thing labeled projections—I guess
 calling “projections exercise”—and interpreted discussion
 numbers.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think won’t go far wrong interpreting
 probability distribution shape probability distribution outcomes.
 MR. POOLE. That’s way interpreted it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. President Lacker.

 MR. LACKER. risk introducing moments probability distribution

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think standard procedure modal.
 MR. LACKER. maximum-likelihood estimate.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.
 MR. MADIGAN. memorandum Committee says, “Please provide
 projections likely outcomes,” et cetera.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m sorry, President Plosser, kept waiting.
 MR. PLOSSER. It’s important. don’t comments. wanted say
 think staff done great job subcommittee done great job.
 important step forward us, strongly supportive it. want thank Governor
 Kohn, Janet Yellen, members subcommittee getting us
 taking step forward. believe that, go time time, refined.
 stumble things language going tricky, want
 commend Committee taking step.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let also commend Governor Kohn, President Stern,
 President Yellen excellent work. really appreciate it. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you. want return point Chairman,
 President Poole, President Fisher raised. conversations, people expressed
 different views juncture optimal long-run inflation rate is. People know
 2 percent kind guy, know good people 1½ percent kinds
 guys. talking people this, hear lot consensus people don’t feel
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 138 162
 
 strongly. would concert President Poole said. Chairman said, “How
 X?”, would happy say, “Giddyap, Chairman.” So, again,
 colorful language. key point think would helpful
 juncture people really emphasize differences that, fact, really consensus
 Committee. takes one two forms. One something past, that’s
 fine; say past actually comfortable
 general Committee is, way soften it. Two case somebody like
 actually publicly talked inflation goal. case, would keep mouth
 shut issue. terms initial launch—again emphasizing fact really
 lot consensus Committee know press loves create opposite
 consensus sells newspapers—the supportive extent
 look unified this, better are. sense actually Committee is,
 would encourage process.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. wanted clarification. explanation, say
 projections based done? example, today, given
 policy move sure everyone around table anticipated move today
 path, articulating numbers came meeting
 with, numbers think policy action taken?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, let’s consistent
 statement. let ask everyone rethink risks conditional policy move today.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
 
 October 30-31, 2007
 
 139 162
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Sorry, Mr. Chairman, two points. One concern
 solution. chart called chart 1, evolved time,
 slight disadvantage, doesn’t fans around didn’t like fans,
 sense pretty narrow range likely outcomes future. wonder
 whether anybody uneasy, given relatively low probability going end
 within time. don’t solution this. wondering whether, changed
 scale—[laughter]. concern real suggested solution—I apologize.
 second point significant. Bill, think asked good question. Mr. Chairman, another
 question interesting is, asked whether world interpret central
 tendency Committee three-year horizon PCE inflation rate consistent
 Committee’s long-run view price stability, answer it?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. represents diversity views Committee
 that, additional caveat everyone may necessarily believe approach
 ideal level price stability even three years, conceivably. mixture elements,
 that’s talk about. Again, would like look speech—
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. No. think consistent described
 discussed, goes point that, Bill, raise,
 optimal horizon always going two years three years. said could
 said, think, that.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman?

 MR. HOENIG. I’m sorry, need understand implied. go

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. wouldn’t mind, yes.
 MR. MADIGAN. appropriate policy going forward.
 MR. HOENIG. Okay. it’s based decision on.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Tom, took view appropriate policy
 last Friday chance assess, light Committee did,
 appropriate policy going forward, whether changed, implications change

 MR. HOENIG. whole point process prepare us meeting,
 going go back reassess process went light took

 it, long what, fact, we’re doing.
 MR. PLOSSER. Greenbook won’t changed. confuses bit. wasn’t
 quite clear—I thought was, guess wasn’t.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. whatever want long agree

 MR. HOENIG. that’s it, I’ll go back it. want make sure that’s
