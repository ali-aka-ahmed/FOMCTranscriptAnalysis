 particularli worri languag paragraph 4. sai “although downsid

 strongli word “predomin”—that, ye, see greater downsid risk, don’t care;
 remain total focus inflat. [laughter] bother me. that’s come across
 me. don’t think intent make wai.
 would make two propos soften it. think need dial down,
 think inflat risk remain upsid. would second two suggest
 alreadi made. would second presid fisher’s suggest remov word
 “predomin” paragraph 4. might sai, “the committe remain concern
 risk inflat fail moder expect.” now, think downsid risk
 increas growth side. i’m sure actual necessari sai explicitli, think
 
 august 7, 2007
 
 96 136
 
 dial paragraph 4 simpli remov “predomin,” along addit
 languag propos line 2, might suffici. think actual agre
 downsid risk increas. want express that, would endors presid pool’s
 suggest move languag downsid risk paragraph 2, sai someth
 “for household busi, hous correct ongo.” could
 sai, “although downsid risk growth increas somewhat, nevertheless
 economi seem like continu expand moder pace.” would get there.
 basic would sai see it, nevertheless think like economi
 grow moder pace. financi turbul diminish market stabil,
 downsid risk growth paragraph 4 continu express asymmetr bia,
 worri inflat, we’ll comfort live go forward, good

 mr. hoenig. mr. chairman, coupl thing. first, satisfi current

 design address that. sai that, also recogn—from observ
 i’ve heard todai—that downsid risk emerg
 brought risk balanc, guess wai sai it. complic that, cours,

 mr. plosser. thank you, mr. chairman. certainli comfort maintain

 try convei market? far go, acknowledg mani
 peopl share—a sens increas risk—without creat anoth set concern

 don’t want take strong stand that.
 on word concern me, i’d like rais issu here. paragraph 3,

 mr. rosengren. support leav target fed fund rate 5¼ percent.
 howev, new sinc last meet would seem elev downsid risk

 also thought paragraph 4 realli accur read. actual littl surpris
 go-round how, almost univers, peopl said downsid risk output
 increas still concern inflat. thought
 paragraph 4 turn prescient—on part chairman, brian, whoever draft
 it—a realli accur view committe wa. concern move first

 mr. warsh. thank you, mr. chairman. dive altern b, i’d sai part

 isn’t storm talk moment ago, hard go back word.
 don’t know go back “predomin” septemb meet
 drop it. wai think question is, pool approach, drop
 “predomin” move downsid risk paragraph 2, roughli equival

 reason governor kohn given, think probabl right construct
 altern b. thank you, mr. chairman.
 chairman bernank. thank you. governor kroszner.
 mr. kroszner. thank much. also support keep fed fund rate
 unchang, much agre wai governor kohn think we’re
 try achiev. let describ think altern b larg achiev that.
 kei think decis chang statement is, first, whether someth
 materi chang market realiz that, chang statement,
 someth actual happen and, second, whether give us flexibl go

 either wai, us criterion inform new chang, quit sure
 chang it. think fine either wai.
 paragraph 4, think import take step toward balanc without go

 time it. also, like easi put take off, growth come back
 up, easili remov languag. growth goe down, move toward balanc risk
 easili want to, governor warsh said, drop “predomin,” cannot
 get back. feel stage—or least discuss around tabl

 august 7, 2007

 market. market saw acknowledg downsid risk took

 risk much stronger signal go move quickli. think

 move toward balanc creat problem along line.
 worri issu, would take word “predomin”

 chairman bernank. right. let get us back statement. [laughter]
 vice chairman geithner.
 vice chairman geithner. thank you, mr. chairman. quickli, think
 actual fairli similar place, far apart basic diagnosi, that’s good, given
 complex decis go forward sens. want soften slightli
 asymmetri current statement give us bit flexibl show awar
 chang realiti there.
 quickli statement, first, agre that, question character
 displai recognit financi market develop, refer volatil mai
 captur it. somebodi suggest sai someth instead go “risk premium”

 convei sens read continu reason favor. would
 fine wai is, could go back june languag.
 question whether refer explicitli downsid risk growth, we’ll
 first time—a sort consequenti act—and, so, it. would
 fine leav implicit rather introduc explicitli. think right: we’re go
 it, unless we’re go chang structur statement significantli put risk
 assess growth paragraph 2 risk assess around inflat paragraph 3,
 need leav paragraph 4. so, again, risk growth, i’m okai put
 languag in. think it’s consist broad object. guess prefer would
 leav implicit.
 final, “predomin,” view repeat “predomin”
 would better simpli state committe remain concern risk
 concern inflat fail moder expect. don’t think argument stick
 “predomin” compel. don’t think take constrain option go
 forward. true it’s shift broad sens, don’t think need sai starkli
 we’ve look set risk—veri differ type risk, fast move,
 uncertain, slower move, probabl manag time—and sai weigh
 balanc think latter risk continu predomin. think that’s substanc
 argument face. think would better slightli soften further. said that,
 live altern b draft. [laughter]
 mr. mishkin. mai make two-hand intervent?

 mr. mishkin. could ask question brian? “predomin” kei word.
 think might respons market leav take out, term two
 element. on issu market would think futur evolut polici.
 two media might read whether react distress financi market.
 mr. madigan. well, said earlier, it’s littl hard judg market reaction right
 now, given flux financi market. said, think introduct “downsid
 risk,” explicit phrase statement obvious overlook market
 particip, [laughter] think see least slight shift
 committe’s bodi english. regard “predomin,” that’s anoth step
 direct—and think mayb even bigger shift.
 mr. mishkin. right.
 mr. dudlei. think bigger shift. think first on unit, second
 mayb two unit term far go.
 chairman bernank. presid moskow.
 mr. moskow. anoth object take word “predomin.”
 don’t think sentenc make sens take out. [laughter] put someth

 reason chang paragraph 3 without reason. unless anyon concern, i’d like chang
 paragraph 3 back june languag. okai. that’s first thing.
 regard tougher question—and presid yellen, presid pool, other
 rais interest possibl—again, without much confid go resist
 follow reason. first reason mostli complic, [laughter] move thing
 around wai make even harder market understand we’re try do.
 anoth reason statement “although downsid risk growth increas
 somewhat,” follow advic put new sentenc paragraph 2,
 essenti sai financi market reason downsid risk increas,
 wherea factor—the hous market, automobil sale, thing sort—that
 could view increas downsid risk. guess that’s recommend.
 “predomin,” think word neutral signific extent us. mai
 recal us phrase “predomin polici concern,” chang second sentenc,
 market base decid gone wai balanc. concern that,
 get rid “predomin” mention downsid risk growth anywher,
 view gone mostli balanc, don’t think that’s right
 committe.
 on thought, mai come late dai here. go back
