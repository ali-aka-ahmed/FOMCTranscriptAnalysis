 focus three major topics. First sharp adjustment market expectations
 concerning monetary policy since last FOMC meeting. Second, talk
 persistence high risk appetites credit markets, focus may
 vulnerable market United States—the subprime mortgage sector.
 Third, want discuss possible factors behind sharp shifts
 seen commodity prices since last FOMC meeting, particular whether
 price movements reflect shift risk appetite among noncommercial investors
 fundamental developments supply demand.
 First, sharp shift market expectations respect interest
 rates since last meeting. time December meeting, consensus
 view among market participants FOMC would begin lower federal
 funds rate target spring easing process would continue 2008,
 cumulative rate cuts 75 basis points. see chart 1,
 looks federal funds futures market, chart 2, looks yield spreads
 March 2008 March 2007 Eurodollar futures contracts,
 expectations shifted sharply past month. easing
 priced midyear 2007 residual 25 basis points easing
 priced beyond that. shift expectations also seen across Treasury
 yield curve. chart 3 shows, Treasury yield curve slightly
 time October FOMC meeting. Since December FOMC meeting,
 rise 35 40 basis points yields two-year thirtyyear maturities. shift expectations reflected predominately real interest
 rates. seen chart 4, breakeven inflation rates changed much
 since last FOMC meeting—the decline breakeven rates occurred early
 intermeeting period reversed recently, slightly
 December meeting. upward shift real rates
 appears reflect reassessment market participants near-term
 path short-term rates also level real short-term rates likely
 prove sustainable medium longer term. buoyancy recent
 activity data may caused market participants reassess level
 real federal funds rate likely prove “neutral” longer term.
 Regarding issue risk appetite, appears significant change
 since last FOMC meeting. Risk appetite remains strong. Corporate credit
 spreads remain tight—especially high-yield sector (as shown chart 5)—
 implied volatilities across broad market categories—equities interest rates
 (see chart 6) foreign exchange rates (see chart 7)—remain unusually low.
 Moreover, turbulence emerging debt equity markets experienced

 calm. areas greatest risk?
 United States, subprime mortgage market appears particularly
 vulnerable sector. vulnerability stems four factors. First, market
 relatively new untested. Chart 8 shows overall trend first residential
 mortgage originations share mortgages type—conforming, jumbo,
 subprime, alt-A, quality category sits subprime
 quite good conforming. seen chart, subprime mortgage
 originations climbed recent years, even overall originations fallen.
 2006, subprime mortgages 24 percent total originations, share
 10 percent 2003. second factor credit standards market
 appear loosened 2006, proportion interest-only loans lowdocumentation loans climbing share total. result, signs
 strains market increasing. chart 9 shows, delinquency rates
 moved somewhat higher. contrast, charge-offs remain low, held rapid
 house price appreciation saw recent years. noteworthy, shown
 chart 10, recent 2006 vintage subprime mortgages showing much
 rapid rise delinquencies earlier vintages showed. third factor
 outstanding subprime mortgage loans adjustable rates. significant
 reset risk given rise short-term rates 2005 first half 2006
 fact many loans started low “teaser” rates. Fourth, housing prices
 pressure, could contribute credit strains. see
 risk vicious cycle. credit spreads securitized market spike loan
 performance poor, sharp downturn lending could result capital market
 securitized subprime mortgage products closes. constriction credit could
 put downward pressure prices lead credit problems among borrowers.
 result would additional credit quality problems, wider credit spreads,
 contraction credit. Fortunately, date news still fairly favorable.
 strong demand credit derivatives obligations created subprime
 mortgage products restrained rise credit spreads. seen chart
 11, spreads still well peaks reached late 2002 early 2003. Thus,
 economics making loans securitizing capital markets
 still work. situation could change quickly, especially labor
 markets become less buoyant performance underlying loans
 deteriorate, leading surge delinquencies charge-offs.
 Let turn commodity markets. issue wish examine
 whether sharp movements commodity prices observed
 since last FOMC meeting represent shifts risk appetite among
 noncommercial investors put funds commodities new asset class
 versus contrasting view price movements predominantly represent
 changes underlying supply demand fundamentals. get sense this,
 let’s look briefly three commodities moved
 representative classes—copper, corn, crude oil. chart 12 shows,
 sharp decline copper prices appears linked large rise copper inventories

 corn, rise prices also appears consistent declining stocks
 United States globally (see chart 13) well growing demand anticipated
 corn production ethanol. crude oil, decline prices
 difficult tie back inventories. Although U.S. inventories remain high relative
 five-year historical average (as shown chart 14), situation persisted
 time without big effect prices. Instead, shift oil prices
 appears driven mostly longer-term forces. seen two ways.
 First, shown chart 15, change oil prices occurred spot
 forward prices. oil curve shifted downward mostly parallel fashion,
 also calls question role unseasonably warm weather primary
 driver. weather primary factor, decline prices
 reflected much strongly spot short-end oil price
 curve. Second, shown chart 16, OPEC spare production capacity
 increasing expected continue increasing 2007. growing safety
 margin reflects slower growth global demand expansion non-OPEC
 output. improved safety margin may important factor behind recent
 developments energy sector.
 Finally, foreign operations period. request vote
 ratify operations conducted System Open Market Account since
 December FOMC meeting.

 MS. JOHNSON. may add footnote—I think also need watch pattern
 inventories behaved. prices pushed process from, say,
 end 2003 various local peaks, incentive hold inventories rose. point
 2006, inventories high—we basically filled every bucket could find crude
 oil—and inventories feed back. It’s dynamic. Price changes create demand inventories.
 real-time value inventories feeds back price. think saw

 inventory well measured. inventories OECD, separating

 wonder they’d year didn’t last year. Second, notice that,
 compare Greenbook GDP forecast central tendency members Committee,
 growth good deal slower—0.3 0.4 slower, realm lot. I’m interested
 see upside risk this, particularly given that, even slower growth rate, get
 zero output gap relatively quickly.
 MR. SLIFMAN. Let first comment specifically consumption forecast
 larger question raised. Dave may want add comments. regard
 consumption forecast, mentioned suggested alternative simulation
 showed Part 1 Greenbook, clearly unexplained strength we’ve seeing
 consumption spending second, third, fourth quarters upside risk forecast.
 We’ve carried 2007, noted Greenbook noted
 briefing, think eventually correct. base forecast historical
 patterns data. past spending gotten line think
 fundamentals consumption, eventually corrected time. couple
 possibilities. One we’ve got timing wrong correction going take longer,
 case would consumption. Another possibility—and goes back
 point Bill made—is could wrong regard income growth. might revised
 up, find lot income growth there. Now, taking forecast rather
 alternative simulations face value—yes, slower FOMC. suspect
 part reason may staff lower estimate potential output growth
 members Committee probably minds; can’t know sure, suspect
 probably goes good way toward explaining difference.
 MS. MINEHAN. You’ve got seven alternative scenarios there, recall correctly

 MR. SLIFMAN. busy.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, were. kudos guys. Four simulations
 slower GDP, higher unemployment, lower fed funds rate. couple cases had, even
 context slower growth higher unemployment, somewhat higher inflation.
 three show stronger paths. I’m wondering, weight alternative scenarios
 equally? know DRI (DRI wrong name now, mean successor company)
 it: give baseline forecast certain rate probability, give alternative
 rates probability various scenarios. sense that? Would weight
 stronger consumption scenario somewhat higher rest no?
 MR. SLIFMAN. don’t think so. Personally, could think equally plausible reasons
 could get stronger aggregate demand growth somewhat weaker aggregate demand growth
 next year. highlighted one possibility Greenbook regard weaker
 investment scenario. Another could housing forecast: Housing could turn weaker
 we’re forecasting. So, aggregate demand side, I’d give equal weighting.
 regard aggregate supply side, suspect there, too, weighting probably equal. It’s little
 harder judge. don’t know whether Bill wants add something.
 MR. WASCHER. think that’s probably right.
 MR. STOCKTON. time last FOMC meeting, feeling though
 incoming spending data coming pretty darn close expectations pretty
 consistent story entering period below-trend growth. noted,
 President Moskow quizzed us about, big fly ointment respect story

 developments certainly brought sharper focus upside risk associated buoyant
 consumer spending. made important policy-magnitude type error, might third
 quarter period low measured GDP growth basically haven’t moved much
 trend. think would need take risk seriously thought
 current setting policy.
 critical reasons remaining patient whether, fact,
 moved trend. think still haven’t seen full effects housing shock

 effects associated going forward. don’t think we’ve seen full multiplier
 accelerator effects that, certainly haven’t seen, estimated econometric models

 think part reason motivating higher saving rate. we’ve raised forecast,
 we’ve raised significantly, don’t think we’re yet surrendering notion current

 risk continues labor market strength.
 Larry said, even given overall dimensions housing shock, we’ve
 encouraged story stabilization. remember that, went investment
 shock earlier decade, didn’t enough imagination bad things could
 get, kept thinking seeing signs slowing stabilization, new

 stronger data spending, still don’t see risks side things. still think
 significant downside risks ought least concerned about.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want follow Vice Chairman
 Geithner’s first question—on inflation. seems factors leading
 lower inflation forecast period temporary—energy prices, owners’ equivalent rent,
 import prices. longer-term factors pressures labor market we’ve talked
 maybe follow-through earlier accommodative financial conditions we’ve
 had. said, chart 6 Bluebook, look past forecast period, doesn’t show
 inflation coming down. Inflation actually goes bit 1½ percent target
 2 percent target. Doesn’t mean expectations moved bit see inflation go

 MR. STOCKTON. Many factors you’re citing temporary downside

 MR. STOCKTON. Well, speak Greenbook-consistent measure, perhaps
 Vincent want talk bit simulations Bluebook. One thing
 keep mind Greenbook-consistent measure R* level real interest rate
 would required output gap return zero twelve quarters. sense, given
 what’s built Greenbook forecast, current level real interest rate delivering
 particular outcome. It’s longer-run estimates R*, are, essence,

 unemployment bit lower, inflation ebbing slightly more. underlying mechanics
 produce outcome relatively straightforward, wonder whether
 heightened sense skepticism halcyon outlook. Let focus two reasons
 skepticism.
 First, things equal, inflation could less well behaved. One reason
 inflation ebbed earlier forecasts slower growth brought small output gap
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 44 255
 
 rising unemployment. Now, output gap virtually eliminated, unemployment remains
 5 percent. Ebbing inflation solely product recent favorable inflation readings,
 assumed persist: lower energy prices, declining import prices, falling shelter prices. It’s
 hard tell point whether recent readings core inflation result fundamentally
 lower inflation pressures luck maybe combination two. think similar range
 uncertainty applies oil prices strength dollar. virtually output gap, seems
 that, baseline best guess might lower inflation, reasons discussed
 Greenbook one approach analysis caution.
 Second, demand could well stronger. baseline forecast assumes consumers

 private saving. saving rate moves negative 1 percent positive 1 percent, highest
 saving rate several years. noted before, ask likely happen

 fact, household net worth share disposable income remains quite high, buoyed part
 likely overestimate real housing values also rising equity markets. timing
 needed increase personal saving rate could well future, creating
 version buoyant consumer alternative scenario instead baseline. Again, output
 gap, potential increased inflationary pressure obvious.
 sum, Greenbook forecast remains view likely baseline.

 broader anxiety affect business spending consumer scenarios

 strength, unemployment stays low, growth exceeds current projections, resource pressures

 I’m going start information District talk briefly national

 One important sector activity appears likely slow 2007 energy. District

 spurred increased production traditional products—and includes oil, gas, coal—as
 well alternative fuels like ethanol biodiesel. According reports couple
 directors, however, recent decline energy prices already led reduction drilling
 activity likely cause cutbacks new investment alternative fuels well.
 Turning national outlook, I, like others, noted recent strength economy
 raised estimates growth fourth quarter somewhat raised first

 diminished somewhat. Moreover, share view recent weakness manufacturing
 activity reflects better balancing production inventories rather fundamental
 weakness. Going forward, improved outlook energy prices support consumer
 spending improving consumers’ disposable income, may see additional fiscal stimulus
 resulting more-favorable budget positions state local governments.
 Finally, terms inflation outlook, views changed materially since
 last meeting. I’ve encouraged recent inflation data, continue expect inflation
 decline forecast period. expect core CPI 2.3 percent range core PCE
 inflation 2 percent 2007. However, others noted, core inflation high,
 considerable uncertainty remains whether recent progress sustained.
 Particularly, clear opposing trends lower energy prices greater resource
 pressures may play next quarters. Consequently, seems upside

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. thought I’d provide couple
 perspectives, first 2006 economy then, extrapolation, trends ’07.
 respect 2006, think economy outperformed market expectations Greenbook
 expectations, probably least four reasons. first underlying strength
 employment market, much discussed today. Second, strength durability
 household finance, which, Vice Chairman Geithner said, turned far

 also looked reliable least reliable indicators state

 less reliable indicator 2006 growth shape yield curve,

 good. mentioned earlier, monthly CPI PCE core measures seemed moving
 around rather significantly, hard us determine much 2006 went

 Taking account, think 2007, find analyzing

 Two key themes summarize views 2007. First, strong employment trends
 continue support consumer spending. Second, strong corporate balance sheets balanced
 global growth support capital expenditures. Now, two themes, would note
 considerably confidence former latter. I’ll spend another moment
 shortly. tone markets appears exceptionally strong. Spreads
 tightened, even yields trended back 5 percent. November December,
 three weeks, $11 billion priced high-yield market. give
 perspective fact, year 2000 total $50 billion high-yield

 Let spend couple moments consumer. Contacts two large credit card

 respect consumer side, reasonably well confident.
 I’ll spend moment business side equation. Fourth-quarter profits
 appear quite good, two-thirds companies beating estimates. many

 consumer come rather strongly continues strong. certainly

 consumer, Kohn mentioned. may special factors come in;

 risk factor here. recent strengthening equity markets perhaps offsets
 reduction asset values homes. Lower consumer energy prices, course,
 offsetting factor, labor market strength increases compensation
 important. there’s upside risk continue very, strong
 consumption instead error correction go back toward saving.
 Second, respect investment, orders shipments quite

 spreads seem low, forth. seeing investment? Investment may
 turn around next quarter so, we’ll woods. think
 conditions predict lead investment turnaround quite

 Third, respect inflation, obviously pleased numbers

 Things moved benign way. don’t think there’s strong expectation

 comments that, please give me, I’ll add comments own.
 Members noted considerable economic strength intermeeting period. Labor
 markets remain taut, continuing wage pressures occupations. Consumption grew
 strongly fourth quarter, momentum first quarter, reflecting strong job
 market, lower energy prices, higher profits. Overall, investment seems likely grow
 moderate pace given good fundamentals. Business people seem generally optimistic,
 financial markets robust.
 still people characterizing two-track economy. Housing,
 although drag now, show tentative evidence stabilization. However,
 warned drawing strong conclusion housing winter months.
 also noted issues credit quality. general view housing would cease subtract
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 growth later year. softness parts manufacturing, especially industries
 related housing automobiles, still exists. part weakness may inventory
 correction may reasonably far advanced point. Despite weakness housing
 parts manufacturing, yet signs spillover employment
 consumption, although raised possibility may see later on. Some,
 all, members agree contour Greenbook economic growth somewhat
 slower near term, strengthening later year, modest increase unemployment.
 Committee generally optimistic potential growth Greenbook, mostly
 members assume labor force growth greater Greenbook
 assumes. Overall, downside risks output appear moderated, upside risk
 emerged growth moderate expected.
 inflation side, people noted recent readings favorable, although
 disagreement cause, whether energy prices, well-anchored inflation
 expectations, less structural inertia, perhaps statistical noise. still expect gradually
 slowing inflation cautious consider upside risk significant, perhaps even greater
 late last year. primary upside risk inflation economic growth potential tight
 labor markets, may lead inflation future near term. Others noted
 inflation expectations may high allow continued progress inflation. overall,
 general tone somewhat stronger economy, perhaps slightly improved outlook
 inflation, but, case, clear view upside risks inflation predominant.

 January 31, 2007—Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everyone. Let’s start asking Dave
 Stockton report morning’s data.
 MR. STOCKTON. So, Mr. Chairman, sort done fly. Unlike BEA,
 won’t able go back revise remarks. [Laughter] Total GDP morning came
 3½ percent. 0.9 percentage point stronger forecast Greenbook.
 really two sources miss fourth quarter. miss, 0.5 net
 export component, Karen speak second, 0.4 nonfarm inventory
 investment. perhaps Karen give quick story net export side, I’ll
 complete report.
 MS. JOHNSON. net export numbers based trade data OctoberNovember, make estimate December going be. Perhaps half
 miss, quite half, due differences opinion December. Looking
 they’ve done December, take information that. they’ve put
 December information didn’t otherwise have. degree, it’s statistical
 really trade. It’s something called territorial adjustment. Maybe quarter
 differences things December prepared change minds
 point. would go strong positive contribution net exports go
 retain difference views December numbers turn
 be. bit news received strong exports services. We’ll take that,
 we’ll probably give adjustment, quite it, number write
 next Q4. actually want reverse thing called territorial adjustment Q1.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 92 255
 
 we’re actually going make imports stronger net export contribution slightly
 negative Q1 result.
 MR. STOCKTON. That’s basically half GDP miss. half
 inventory investment side. like Karen, half miss inventory investment
 difference opinion December book value figures turn
 be. it’s difference BEA’s estimate December estimate
 December. don’t think we’d inclined alter December estimate, we’d write
 roughly half miss nonfarm inventory investment. don’t great job
 forecasting book value inventory figures either. though lots
 information good reason staking forecast versus BEA’s, don’t
 think information do. private domestic final purchases,
 emphasizing, even given recent noise net exports
 government, were, fact, almost exactly right; 4 basis points terms
 contribution overall GDP. terms composition, consumption bit weaker,
 equipment spending bit stronger, probably BEA’s estimate share autos
 sold businesses versus households. don’t really see much information there.
 net, government bit weaker: federal side weaker state
 local side stronger.
 MS. MINEHAN. number domestic final purchases, Dave?
 MR. STOCKTON. actually don’t know domestic final purchases were,
 include government, do, little weaker number
 written down.
 MS. MINEHAN. No, overall number.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 93 255
 
 MR. STOCKTON. Yes, don’t know overall number is; know
 contributions are. We’ll able get overall number break time. Taking board
 differences opinion December figures, we’d probably writing down,
 release hand today, GDP estimate fourth quarter 3 percent rather
 3½ percent currently published—and contrast 2½ percent wrote
 Greenbook.
 question is, imply overall momentum activity
 going first quarter? answer “not much,” don’t think blind
 stubbornness, although I’m glad wife dispute particular characterization.
 [Laughter] two surprises—as Karen already indicated, would inclined
 actually mark contribution net exports GDP growth first quarter
 basis net export side. would probably inclined thing respect
 higher inventory investment, we’re coming first quarter somewhat higher
 inventory-sales ratios maybe indications we’re far along working
 inventories thought. I’m glad don’t actually write first-quarter
 number today employment report Friday first real readings
 pace activity first quarter end week next week two.
 basically I’d argue isn’t lot signal 3½ percent figure we’re moving
 first quarter much thrust. Another reason necessarily marking activity
 move first half year, even though GDP came 1 percentage point
 estimates, real disposable income actually came 1 percentage point weaker
 Greenbook estimate. isn’t though, higher growth rate activity,
 underlying growth labor income likely spent going forward. even

 lower saving rate fourth quarter written down. Thus think
 several reasons necessarily reading sign greater strength moving first

 inflation side, things actually spot on. Total PCE inflation minus
 0.8 percent. That’s written Greenbook. Core PCE 2.1—also
 exactly written Greenbook. Market-based core 1.7;
 actually 0.1 percentage point better written Greenbook.
 major release morning employment cost index, showed year-over-year
 increase 3.2 percent. number also exactly written
 Greenbook, don’t think really see difference. Obviously, number continued
 subdued. totality, inflation side, things looking close
 expectations think still pretty good. Mr. Chairman, that’s say.

 Thus would ill-advised suggest statement finished acting

 those, continue believe, President Plosser, section 2 alternative C bit
 cleaner, bit shorter, bit reflective overall way see things. could go

 implying might want think terms Committee’s judging
 inflation remains predominant concern. think that’s little stronger “the Committee
 judges inflation risks remain.” would take remaining phrase sentence
 out—about near-term policy firming likely policy easing—as think might
 big shock. changing language “inflation remains predominant concern”
 picking “future policy adjustments” would make small change inflation risk
 section, would focus people bit firmly that, would step right direction

 “some inflationary risks remain” language correctly reflects sense people
 around table. Now, may much. don’t want speak Tim, one point
 thought much.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Well, no, I’d make observation
 debated debated several times question whether best
 introductory phrase balance risk assessment exactly language. problem
 now—this one man’s view—is think read significant
 alteration signal, strength we’ve discussed changes
 outlook December, can’t justify significant change signal. second reason
 one Chairman raised. introduces slightly infelicitous framing
 risk people read everything say prism whether we’re
 midst altering implicitly hierarchy objectives Committee

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. couldn’t framed way. [Laughter]

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. think haven’t changed view

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Intervention, President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, think background
 said last time. go back section 2 December, cautious growth.
 section 2 alternative B now, we’re basically saying seeing firmer economic
 growth. don’t want overdo this, think Vice Chairman Geithner’s point absolutely
 correct here. Let’s think we’re coming indicate reality we’ve talked
 about. concerned inflation. Using word “predominant” excessively emphasizes
 concern. point may need tighten, let’s think migration
 December. think migration adequately captured language
 alternative B.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Let also support Tim this. slightly different slant here,
 inflation numbers actually come better. concern
 economy coming stronger may necessitate tightening. don’t want give
 impression think inflation numbers worse that’s big problem. It’s really
 perspective going forward, that’s additional reason changing language
 case.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vincent.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First all, favor unchanged fed funds
 rate target. prefer sections 2 3 alternative C. read conversation around table,
 don’t hear anyone saying need prime markets probable increase fed
 funds rate March. Possibly June sense; probably later get bad news inflation
 stronger economy anticipated.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 115 255
 
 went back statements started working language. language
 really dates March pretty close it. March said, “Some policy firming may
 needed.” May said, “Some policy firming may yet needed.” June
 said, “The extent timing additional firming . . . may needed.” think that,
 started language, sense edge needing additional
 tightening. Certainly pause August not, recall it, viewed necessarily permanent.
 called pause; didn’t call stop. sense August September that,
 continuing escalation inflation, ready move higher. saying
 best guess going hang might edge
 tightening. sense time, think that’s way market read it.
 succeeding months, conditions changed lot. economy came softer
 anticipated. Housing deeper decline thought. Inflation numbers came
 favorable side—not dramatically better, certainly favorable development. policy
 meaning language changed consequence evolution time first
 adopted it.
 need view language terms how, let’s say, graduate student five years
 now, looking transcript, read discussion around table. say
 December, probably October certainly December meeting, Committee
 edge signaling increase market. That’s problem section 4 alternative
 C. It’s fairly clear indication seriously want signal market we’re edge
 raising rates March, don’t think that’s are. think need
 view language terms current situation also evolution, several
 people commented that, course, are. ideal time move away
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 116 255
 
 language market commentary much direction expecting
 Committee going hold rate constant time. That’s market commentary.
 That’s futures markets. won’t easier time move away language
 right now, purpose memo distributed. would really like see us get
 back toward English language meaning words rather inherited policy meaning
 come consequence repetition.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. favor keeping rates unchanged today, favor
 language alternative B sections. Trying cautious, looking numbers
 came out, reflecting back yesterday’s discussion NAIRU, last night looked
 exhibit 5 staff presented yesterday. looked bottom right panel,
 shows labor force participation rate 62. lot us baby boomers,
 we’re generally healthy folks, really unclear we’re going do. baby
 boomers changed participation labor force throughout generation.
 generation brought women labor force. going live twenty years
 age 65, we’re going sit idle we’re going healthier lot
 skills. additional skill set could actually mitigate shortage skilled
 workers. Folks probably want flexibility. don’t want payroll, may
 want take job work contract. Whatever historical NAIRU patterns
 have, going tested changing labor force participation due baby boomers.
 That’s big unknown, clearly affects potential growth, output gap, inflation pressures.
 really don’t want signal anything. play long period, reason,
 look “Lower NAIRU” alternative scenario Greenbook, read “higher
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 participation rate,” want cautious. That’s can’t go alternative C. don’t want
 signal much worry inflation. also want careful don’t go strong calling
 something “rebounding” don’t want people think we’re going go back mid-3
 percent growth rates housing still soft sustained basis. still need watch
 housing. strong job market put legs growth side this, like changes
 made section 2. think firmer growth exactly want talk about, like
 tone we’ve set changes B.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like others, favor maintaining federal
 funds rate current level today. President Plosser pointed out, strength data
 employment spending imply higher natural real rate. time, inflation data
 come really favorable expected pointed moderation we’ve
 hoping for. Today’s information confirmed PCE low staff
 thought going fourth quarter that, least comprehensive
 compensation measure have, pickup compensation remains very, damped might
 even consistent lower NAIRU built staff forecast. balancing two,
 think we’re right are. Vice Chairman Geithner said something yesterday
 patient, think patient least little longer. time agree
 everyone else, said yesterday, strength demand, low unemployment rate,
 sluggish rise productivity suggest upside risks moderate decline
 inflation we’re seeking.
 language, I’d prefer alternative B down, let give reactions
 others. issue section 2 Governor Bies mentioned. seems
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 118 255
 
 word “rebounding,” particularly published 3½ percent Q4, might imply
 process continuing. staff’s projection that, anything, would write Q1
 bit. don’t know people would read word “rebounding”; might sense
 continuing strength see. That’s like changes made alternative B.
 little backward-looking: “Recent indicators suggested somewhat firmer economic
 growth.” That’s kind know. also projecting general way moderate growth
 going forward. word “rebounding” section 2 little momentum
 comfortable with.
 section 3, went alternative C, would need clear talking
 twelve-month inflation remains elevated, that’s 2.3 percent core PCE.
 used first sentence, would need get little technical usually get
 announcement say “improved modestly recent months remained elevated twelvemonth basis” confuse people recent months. consideration makes
 favor sticking alternative B. think high level resource utilization foundation
 concerns inflation risk. means labor product markets fairly tight,
 increases cost, businesses easily pass through. like keeping
 reference resource utilization section 3. gives little flavor—a rationale—for we’re
 worried inflation process, would prefer keep rationale there.
 risk assessment, I’d stick are. don’t think anyone misunderstands
 we’re doing. less stale sense December—[laughter] December
 doubts really worried downside risk output. It’s
 indicative today December. regard President Poole’s point,
 say “the extent timing additional firming may needed,” leaves open
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 119 255
 
 possibility isn’t next meeting, might another meeting. disagree Vincent’s
 point somehow gives us sense we’re certain we’re going need tighten
 really are. says “any additional firming may needed,” don’t think says
 we’re definitely going firm. market understands mean. market’s reaction
 incoming data intermeeting period constructive. We’re saying anything
 that’s getting way stabilizing properties markets, section 4 I’d leave well
 enough alone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let spend minute talking market
 issue turning language. We’ve talked bit Vincent talked bit optionimplied measures uncertainty policy path, near historical lows. That’s
 certainly case now, case last met. Even though expected path
 policy market prices moved much closer past two months, it’s though
 markets saying—to touch glib—“always certain, rarely right.” would thought
 would seen market uncertainty policy path change along view
 going take less-dramatic action past six weeks. tells market
 measures uncertainty may altogether accurate here, that’s troubling sign try
 figure whether really telling us uncertainty whether separate bet
 unrelated future policy actions.
 Today I, too, favor maintaining federal funds rate target, generally share views
 expressed alternative B. Governor Kohn suggests, jump “mixed” “rebounding”
 operative word suggests reaction data strikes somewhat positive,
 time sense hasn’t changed dramatically past six weeks.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 120 255
 
 markets seem moved dramatically, really rock process. markets
 come closer us, I’d rather appear overly reactive recent data.
 respect section 4, concerned one point words “the Committee
 judges inflation risks remain” seemed little dovish. minutes
 speeches colleagues, wording come mean exactly inflation
 concern anything else. ways become ossified true, don’t see
 benefit going alternative C. that, generally support alternative B suspect
 shouldn’t making many dramatic changes that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you. I, too, support alternative B maintaining federal
 funds rate 5.25 percent. agree many arguments made before,
 won’t repeat them. I’ll go language. section 2, think would overreaction
 appear overreaction current data suddenly went
 “rebounding.” Governor Kohn suggested “rebounding” problematic implications going
 forward. particularly true think least 0.5 percentage point 3.5 percent
 taken away revisions. Alternative B nicely encompasses that, even didn’t know
 number would bit firmer expected. also think section 3 it’s problematic
 use words “in recent months remain elevated” recent months core inflation hasn’t
 elevated; looks though numbers fairly consistently 2 fairly
 consistently six twelve months ago average. wording gives
 misleading impression. section 4, even though suggested alternative, really
 clarify discussion thought discussion focusing issue
 wording, though good discussion. remain favor

 changing language, mainly markets seem learned interpret way
 think would appropriate. Exactly Governor Kohn said, market reacting data
 sensible way, given perspective likely evolution data. Since seem
 kind getting data perspective we’re likely right, would seem
 inopportune time change language. Thank much.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. slightly different take economy think
 inflation numbers seen recently likely reflecting something that’s actually
 happening. I’m little sanguine inflation front

 terms language, bit mixed section 2. lean toward little stronger
 language and, therefore, leaning little toward using alternative C section 2. worry
 bit word “rebounding,” I’m sure. Section 2 alternative B fine
 well—a little mix there. feel strongly move section 3 alternative C

 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Mr. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. important thing
 us today, it’s really thing need do, convey sense that, basis
 recent data, see somewhat less downside risk growth maybe somewhat less upside risk
 inflation. principal issue face whether we’re going see inflation come far
 enough current constellation financial conditions, we’ve helped induce. That’s
 issue debating time. It’s possible, maybe probable,
 tighten further, don’t know yet. don’t think need change basic signal
 probability we’re going tighten more, I’m comfortable
 language alternative B. course, alternatives flawed. Alternative B seems least
 flawed among alternatives. interesting question whether referring current core inflation
 elevated today helpful. could amend B(3) say, “Although core inflation remains
 elevated, recent readings core inflation improved modestly recent months.”
 can’t really without suggested—that is, distinguishing clearly
 twelve-month three-month rate—and it’s hard argue really worthwhile.
 I’m comfortable alternative B drafted now.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Thank insights.
 recommendation also take action maintain bias toward tightening.
 heard clearly Committee’s concerns inflation risk, recognize may
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 123 255
 
 take action direction later year. would counsel patience moment
 several reasons. First, level federal funds rate probably far need
 be. didn’t hear anyone suggesting 75 100 basis points away
 need be. Second, clearly conveyed bias policy, don’t think would
 problem taking action. one going accuse us provided sufficient
 warning. Third, there’s confluence data we’ve seen since last meeting, including
 improvement inflation data, gives us, nothing else, bit breathing space
 observe believe remain relatively significant uncertainties evolution
 real economy. housing market looked bit solid, worst outcomes
 made less likely. given breathing space observe evolves, think
 waiting bit would wise.
 point I’d like make—I’ve made others, think
 quite important—is endogeneity financial conditions. five-year ten-year bond rates

 Skipping risk assessment moment, share people’s concerns accuracy

 MR. POOLE. one question here. intend minutes make clear
 general—well, “expectation” strong—but tilt bias direction tightening later
 year, think matches said.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole, responded something said
 go-round. think language alternative B, section 4 saying we’re move
 next meeting. says essentially next move likely up, it’s clear
 “extent timing” could mean meetings respond. thought
 tenor meeting discussion economic situation quite clear concerns
 inflation remain paramount, I’m sure reflected minutes.
 MR. POOLE. question coordination statement
 minutes—whether we’re going indicate clearly minutes sense around table

 certainly December. That’s I’m asking about.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. I’m sure we’ve done consciously, way

 valuable—a much textured sense statement central tendency

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. First all, I’m fine proposal. would gone

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. second portion meeting devoted
 communications. President Plosser submitted memo external communication
 suggested might unease Committee. hope somewhat reducing
 unease, thought would try state one time trying get discussed
 issue before. Perhaps without taking much time away important discussion
 want today, anyone would like respond that, I’d certainly happy hear.
 people two concerns talking public communication
 issues. first would try avoid interfering ongoing discussion
 development consensus within Committee. second try avoid creating
 unnecessary political problems might complicate adoption whatever decide we’d like
 do. recommendation would ask two questions. first would be,
 “Would remarks give elicit opposition significant disagreement
 members Committee?” answer “yes,” giving remarks, risk
 possibility people might sense compelled respond,
 debate public. sense therefore would probably great idea give
 speech specifically pros cons inflation targeting, example, even tried
 take somewhat neutral position it’s inevitably difficult take neutral position.
 However, want clear. think it’s perfectly okay people talk broader
 themes—the importance low stable inflation, importance credibility, importance
 commitment, importance clear communication. see problem
 broad, general issues think everyone around table would agree don’t
 necessarily speak issues we’re still discussing within Committee. question
 I’d suggest ask is, “Would something say today likely end repeated
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 131 255
 
 Chairman congressional testimony.” [Laughter] particular concern mine. lesson
 would take that, talk importance low stable inflation,
 certainly good thing do, also make point are, course, committed dual
 mandate one principal reasons seek price stability strengthen real
 economy.
 thoughts. want reiterate guidance, regulation. ask
 people use judgment feel constrained talking broad issues,
 particularly issues would command wide agreement Committee, certainly don’t
 disavow previous positions. pressed far issue, certainly
 always say Committee currently discussing issues we’ll saying
 future. Again, certainly intention intention trying censor
 people’s words. hope continue talk broad issues price stability
 communication, critical function central bank. don’t want take great
 deal time broader discussion, anyone would like react, certainly would
 time. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. think really clear, common sense, constructive.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. comments, I’ll turn
 meeting Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. thought would begin saying words
 process. I’ve number questions people process
 considering communication issues see next couple meetings. hope today
 come sense central tendency expression Committee
 want go projection forecast process. don’t expect complete
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 agreement want go. don’t expect every question answered. think
 probably narrow range things we’re looking get sense modal
 Committee member would like go this. also recognize decisions make
 aspects communication monetary policy—for example, numerical specification price
 stability—would come back interact might want use forecast.
 March, revisit issue numerical specification price stability,
 discussed October. I’ve asked staff work material. Basically I’ve asked
 take pieces memo January ’05 talked things range versus point;
 index modification index; transformation index; price level versus inflation
 targeting; horizon, any, ought specify this—some more-specific
 issues need think we’re going numerical specification price stability.
 sense coming October meeting vast majority people Committee
 wanted move direction, although exactly wanted wasn’t clear. I’ve told
 staff assume Committee moving direction, task debate
 whole thing rather get little specific. getting specific test
 notions would work much favor are. March meeting
 go two days, we’ll discussing things. Chairman put table another
 item March meeting, issue concerning announcement balance
 risks. time March, would great get it. not, shortly thereafter need
 think directions seem moving projection side
 numerical specification side interactions announcements, minutes,
 modalities communicating public.

 would hope March Committee meeting, subcommittee—President Stern,
 President Yellen, I—could take stock gotten to; issues
 narrowed; Committee seems heading; open issues are; don’t get
 announcement minutes March, things might interact. could
 come back Committee June, next two-day meeting, ask guidance
 keep pushing process conclusion. need dry runs whatever
 decide strategy rolling public public’s elected representatives.
 get closer decision, talk proceed two issues.
 that’s general process I’m envisioning next couple meetings, Mr. Chairman.

 think one Vince’s options sketched this—in staff produces initial forecast along
 lines Greenbook (they great forecasting record) members would send

 Regarding question conditioning assumptions, strongly believe publish
 reflect best sense actually going happen. preference, accordingly,
 would condition forecasts think actually going set policy events
 unfold. Conditioning assumption—a market’s policy path unchanged policy—
 means explain forecast may counterfactual. means that, order figure

 forecast. means extent published forecast reduces public’s uncertainty
 future macroeconomic outcomes going limited. means accountability

 think, stated inflation rate policy designed achieve. If, instead, adopt
 counterfactual policy assumption, stating inflation objective makes published
 forecast even less informative since people would know forecast differs

 Vince’s questions, questions 3 4, think accompanying narrative

 show forecast path inflation returning near objective. Again, condition
 market assumptions, period needs long enough determine whether forecast appears

 much information there, many things potentially giving rise commentary
 that’s necessarily helping understanding rather confusing it?
 come back answer first question Vince asked, think.
 serious misgivings whether changing Monetary Policy Reports
 related forecasts might beneficial enough offset downside risks. think is,
 however, value talking something along lines Vice Chairman Geithner
 implicitly proposed.
 Now, let quickly answer eight questions Vince raise. First all, think
 joint forecast avoided. survey individual member forecasts preference.
 would aggregate present central tendency either using existing procedures
 modification seems useful. would require Committee members use common
 assumptions either fed funds path elements. experience, I’ve taken
 comfort different Committee members different assumptions policy preferences
 often develop semiannual forecasts next year half much different

 own. don’t believe Boston best take economy works
 near-term risks play out, fact way see near-term outcome
 “appropriate policy” mainstream way others see gives confidence
 we’re right track. noted before, range forecasts hasn’t bad
 predictor key economic outcomes.
 third question whether forecast accompanied minutesstyle description. release forecast accompanied Monetary Policy Report,
 definition Chairman’s view things. result, necessity perhaps, forecasts
 develop get little attention report. release forecasts often, would
 need verbal text like Monetary Policy Report. perhaps could take first step
 changing way Monetary Policy Report formulated right give little bit
 attention forecasts Committee making. Whether means Monetary
 Policy Report Committee report, Chairman’s report, obvious next question,
 don’t answer that. maybe small step take would highlight
 report forecasts there.
 fourth question whether Committee jointly agree minutes-style
 description. Frankly, I’m wondering would stuff. We’ve got meeting
 January February comes minutes forecast Monetary Policy Report.
 We’ve got meeting March. We’ve got one May. We’ve got June, similar
 January, meeting August, one September, one November December we’re
 writing minutes—all which, noted before, implicit either qualitative
 quantitative senses Greenbook forecast Committee members’ forecast.
 implies April October months could probably this. think
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 151 255
 
 trying create—and someone referred earlier—a minutes-like description set
 forecasts without meeting around set forecasts would really hard. may
 way rearranging meeting dates get dates work better. However, seems
 though we’d working lot stuff, simultaneously keep
 range things now. answer question 5 I’m convinced two
 times year right isn’t right frequency.
 question 6, understand argument longer-term forecast period. understand
 reveals future policy preferences tradeoffs, don’t think long-term forecasts provide
 whole lot else. long-term forecast isn’t going realized. It’s goal anything else.
 It’s hard make forecasts six months right mark, let alone several years out,
 could imply know control actually longer period
 time. going extend horizon, would extend little—to go, example,
 year half two three years perhaps. would stay number variables
 currently forecast—nominal real GDP, unemployment, measure inflation.
 Finally, think conveying we’re certain forecast obviously
 desirable. know central banks used fan charts. They’ve proven useful. know they’ve
 accepted. don’t know well they’re understood. find wondering
 U.S. context average person average congressman would actually take them.
 Even rather short periods time, range outcomes we’re certain even
 70 percent level really kind wide. view qualitative discussion sources
 risk preferable quantitative one. time anything well understood, suppose,
 feeling range uncertainty without academic understanding you’re
 trying confusing rather less.
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 pull together, I’m intrigued Vice Chairman Geithner’s implicit proposal
 improving internal discussion detail forecasts constraining
 factors see policy going. would try pull together consensus
 view. consensus view, would tell people it, I’d little
 concerned terms commitment. also think could work current
 forecasts actually handled Monetary Policy Report. think central forecast
 useful: problems terms says Committee Committee members.
 I’m convinced common forecast variables path forecasts useful. I’m
 convinced actually handle frequent release forecasts public, think
 explicit numerical discussion uncertainty difficult. that’s am, it’s
 worth.

 state-of-the-art practice, think would useful make incremental improvements

 let address questions Vince sent memo. first
 whether provide one forecast many. answer many. large
 geographically dispersed make unified option practical. Bank England committee

 process reportedly time-consuming contentious, fear attempt arrive
 single forecast could end undermining collegiality, mention effectiveness.
 important practical side unified forecast desirable. think hold diversity
 views, believe diversity respectfully represented aspects
 communication. diversity goes beyond conditioning assumptions, like price oil.
 us divergent conceptions structure economy monetary policy
 transmission mechanism. Given diversity views, it’s fair say meetings,
 unified forecast forecast story even exists, don’t see participants fundamentally
 disagree could, tried produce unified forecast, speak public economy without
 revealing differences. differences, balance, source strength. reduce
 odds become trapped “group think” mentality, conforming conformity’s sake,
 reduce risk miss important insights could help us avoid errors.
 problem divergence makes challenging articulate type unified Committee
 views think markets really crave.
 first question goes ask whether individual forecasts released
 disaggregated format presented aggregated way. prefer aggregated approach
 use range central tendency. time we’ll end center gravity
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 forecasts described useful way, even though divergent views. Also,
 conveying interpret body forecasts useful public simply
 releasing nineteen separate projection documents. principle, drawback central tendency
 results may entirely coherent different forecasters get excluded
 different variables. Based past experience, seems theoretical possibility
 actual problem, intrigued discussion R&S Division’s memo
 could possible identify entire set variables individual participant outlier
 exclude them. think that’s worth thinking about. Finally, besides distributing central
 tendency range, providing histogram showing full frequency distribution forecasts
 could useful.
 second question asks whether base forecasts common assumptions
 concerning stance policy factors or, alternatively, appropriate policy opinions
 factors. I’m certainly “appropriate policy” camp. think alternative
 problematic. Several times past we’ve discussed possibility adopting common
 assumption constant interest rate, approach could lead forecasts would
 seen desirable Committee members. example, since constant interest rate may
 appropriate policy, could produce forecast inflation that’s high rising, think
 would confusing public convey sense would happen.
 problem especially pronounced forecast period lengthened. second issue is,
 said, participants differ structure economy, common policy assumption
 may make sense one model another. comment applies conditions
 variables—even things like value dollar house prices endogenous variables
 
 January 30-31, 2007

 determined within model used. imposing common assumptions
 variety models could lead incoherent results.
 Now, third fourth questions concern whether narrative description forecast

 MR. POOLE. couple fairly quick points make. First, terms audience

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. First all, want deal general question Cathy alluded
 outset. strongly supportive more-effective reporting forecast several reasons.
 One helps market understand actions better, think high value.
 part process anchoring inflation expectations, think key successful
 monetary policy. important also indicates degree openness allows public
 discourse views; political benefits terms showing we’re accountable
 political system. answered question much affirmative.
 One issue research said this. President Fisher absolutely right:
 issues subjective. research staff said strong evidence, reason
 it’s almost impossible get and, terms econometrics, it’s difficult. literature
 area transparency is, fact, somewhat unsatisfying it’s hard quantify
 anything. terms research strategy, frequently draws people case studies, one

 criminals involved activity. Chairman also involved work
 case studies together. Part reason look details deal
 this. get involved evaluating monetary policy, Sweden recently,
 get talk wide elements society. Swedish case, tremendous support
 degree openness, felt politically valuable surprising groups.
 labor unions extremely supportive, example, kind openness and, believe
 not, inflation targeting—which somewhat surprise.
 let turn issues discuss. want provide analytic
 framework think this, least myself. think seven basic principles
 key terms might go providing information forecasts.
 seven principles, I’ll discuss turn. First, need allow diversity
 views. Second, process needs efficient. Third, needs timely. Fourth, needs
 relatively frequent. Fifth, needs explain forecast—that is, need tell story, good
 narrative, it. Sixth, needs emphasize uncertainty. Seventh, need stress
 forecast period longer policy period. Let go one time,
 you’ll see leads particular answers questions, least perspective.
 first principle need allow diversity views. strongly believe,
 particularly I’m involved process, diversity views strength
 monetary policy process. fact, take view people different jobs here. I’ve
 sides fence—maybe, Janet, president.
 executive vice president Bank. Bank presidents bring different information
 bear governors, difference helps us make better decisions. believe kind
 diversity. Another positive aspect diversity set staffs.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 164 255
 
 Board’s staff, twelve staffs actually act check balance
 other. Again, value. Finally, believe committees make better decisions
 individuals. Alan Blinder study topic thought really quite interesting.
 second issue efficiency. forecast process workable finite time,
 that’s really critical. sometimes get nervous Dave starts twitching me, don’t want
 forecast process overwhelm staffs. I’m sympathetic. research
 Federal Reserve Bank, side fence, really understand
 pain.
 timeliness, important advantages getting forecast quickly.
 said “forecast,” didn’t mean forecast; include narrative, too, you’ll see
 think narrative important. key reason timeliness give forecast
 narrative impact. quicker come them, impact have.
 particular, environment getting information much controlled
 speeches even testimony, think that’s value. quicker much better. Timeliness also
 makes forecast narrative less likely stale. longer interval
 policy meeting make decision release forecast narrative,
 likely obsolete. One danger data could come make forecast
 look silly. there’s issue looking good. faster come forecast,
 better are.
 fourth issue frequency. key forecast release need
 done often enough markets get information think need understand what’s
 going on. Fifth, narrative important markets, Congress, public see
 forecasts also understand them. understood, forecasts need story behind them.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 165 255
 
 strongly believe need write good story good narrative help us obtain
 public support policy actions—which is, again, critical factor.
 Sixth, it’s really important make sure public markets understand high
 degree uncertainty face. Forecasts tough—not long-term forecasts also shortterm forecasts. David is, course, nodding head this. key reason emphasizing
 uncertainty important lessen public criticism miss—which surely
 going times. We’ve actually good relative others, we’re going make
 mistakes. least, people understand degree uncertainty, help. make
 clear uncertainty, make easier people understand there’s diversity views
 Committee. It’s participants don’t like other, it’s
 frequently fundamentally disagree. different uncertainty views
 economy, that’s actually exactly indicated fact forecasts uncertain.
 Also, information uncertainty important information markets. want help
 markets figure we’re what’s going on, don’t care first
 moment also second moment even sometimes third moment.
 Finally, issue horizon—I think need long horizon. look
 literature optimal policymaking, comes clearly horizon
 think terms paths variables care policy
 horizon, would say would two years. sensible way thinking
 think policy typically involve periods longer two years takes affect
 output inflation. need express recognition clarify that,
 paths forecasts, talk consistent
 ultimate objectives. give example: inflation substantially comfort zone,
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 166 255
 
 getting inflation two-year period may costly. result, may talk
 longer period assure public, Congress, markets that, fact, we’re
 something sensible. need go longer period now. see clearly
 Bluebook’s optimal paths. issues taking long get
 inflation objective—ten years—and build expectations, indicate
 period longer two years absolutely necessary thinking policy.
 Let use principles talk eight questions posed us

 process would way cumbersome inefficient. matter charming
 colorful would be, would nightmare.
 MR. FISHER. Always charming.
 MR. MISHKIN. It’s hard enough Bank England committee nine
 people. nineteen. Furthermore, Bank England they’re living
 house talking time. people country different
 jobs, it’s infeasible it. think Dave would quit. [Laughter] would eat huge
 amount staff resources, might research directors quitting going
 research staffs Reserve Banks. would hard get timely agreement it—and,
 again, think timeliness important. would also hard get diversity views clearly
 expressed. end Janet ends up—I think need keep something like
 current procedure nineteen participants give views. important
 attributions amalgamate views way. procedure
 may perfect—maybe there’s something better—but something similar.
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 167 255
 
 Question 2: common conditioning factors? Here, again, believe
 diversity views good thing, agree Janet participant
 conditioning factors. important conditioning factor clearly path federal
 funds rate, mixed feelings it. may want provide information
 individual participants think this. concern details really
 matter. danger people seem making commitment, know
 path one specifies surely going path actually transpires new data
 going come in. I’ve concerned issue, fact wrote paper
 cited R&S document. Sometimes transparency may go far. particular, fan
 “moderate pace” language Federal Reserve used past—I
 time, think language express issue conditionality enough. Committee
 change path, surely might point, could accused flipflopping, would create severe problems Committee. However, maybe
 appropriately fan charts derive degree uncertainty, really need discuss
 possibility. details matter. even think going direction, trial runs
 going critical, want bit open mind that.
 question 3, obviously reasons outlined earlier, strongly support narrative
 accompany forecast. question 4, feel narrative forecast need
 timely. could this, would great advantage quickly, possibly even
 beginning week FOMC meeting. would require much expedited
 process. We’d use delegation—to Chairman staff—for writing
 process. would require moving Greenbook bit. us produce forecasts
 narrative, need see Greenbook—I certainly needed see Greenbook come

 Chairman Geithner provided. might verbally. might way it,
 nice. could go staff little earlier now—let’s say,
 Wednesday. narrative could written would go people FOMC
 meeting could discussed FOMC meeting. don’t know would work.
 would require go much iterative process sometimes do—that
 critical timeliness issue. One thing might think “Recent
 Developments” part Greenbook, releasing might value. would
 staff; would Committee. gives flesh discussion would
 summary, might think something well.
 question 5, frequency, don’t think twice year enough give markets
 information need. eight times year, again, worry losing top people
 staffs; might come us pitchforks. tend lean four, interesting
 issue timing meetings, we’d work out. quarterly seems
 right me. question 6, believe forecast period needs longer policy
 period, reasons discussed earlier, clearly longer two years. However,
 long period might put much burden us. period three years, common
 central banks, would give flavor direction path we’re thinking would
 adequate.
 question 7, keep things burdensome, want use KISS
 principle—the fewer variables better. minimum, three variables think
 right ones ones think obvious—an inflation measure, output measure,
 employment measure. think kill nominal GDP; it’s vestige past.

 would uncomfortable providing projections potential GDP. think need
 purposes, raises really huge political economy problems people think
 speed limit target growth, could dangerous. although welcome
 Federal Reserve Bank New York’s document received, think would
 particularly wise release it.
 question 8, reasons outlined earlier, think it’s extremely important us
 provide information uncertainty. Fan charts right way this. really like
 see here, might technical details we’d decide on: give one
 70 percent confidence interval? give shadings? There’s issue

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Intervention, President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. quick question narrative. Would see

 detailed actually little reflective different views. think it’s question
 writing good story. One thing learned that, even scholar, learn particularly
 writing. case think Committee learn trial runs. might
 say, gee, short; doesn’t give flavor, long involved, it’s
 difficult come decision it. answer let’s discuss it,
 we’ll much better feel it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, talked briefly Norges Bank Norway,

 wrong way we’re things we’re getting way stabilizing

 third point, I’ll stop, ask practical way this.
 President Minehan mentioned lot. doubt could more,
 constraints time. practical, also wary questions raise
 providing information. elements may interested preserving
 independence may threat independence—I won’t mention might since
 don’t want record. Mr. Chairman, three concerns, I’ll spare

 find myself, importantly, agreement President Yellen Governor Mishkin—
 every respect, respects. I’ll try little concise going
 be. think it’s important confront issues Presidents Fisher, Poole,
 Minehan raised. agree nothing fundamentally broken we’re
 now. markets good job, public good job, anticipating
 understanding we’re going business, even pretty good job
 anticipating want go eventually. compelling reason change right
 now, doesn’t mean we’re best possible place. think could improve

 first question, given size Committee, diversity, forth, think
 stick making individual forecasts. would publish kind aggregated
 way, now. I’m kind attracted histogram—let public see whole

 central tendencies you’re choosing different people central tendency.
 experience writing things up—when Chairman allowed us to—[laughter]
 inconsistencies weren’t major problem time. could tell coherent story
 around central tendencies. Sometimes use little imagination, wasn’t really

 incoherent. [Laughter] think Chairman Bernanke demonstrated last two
 testimonies—to take central tendencies submit tell pretty good story that’s
 helpful public.
 many reasons ought go individual assumptions. use
 individual assumptions, “appropriate policy,” rather common assumption, we’re

 ways thing. think individual assumptions, rather

 another histogram central tendency, President Yellen suggested? may end there,
 wouldn’t start that. think multiplies odds inconsistencies among central
 tendencies. You’ve got interest rates output could also inconsistent could
 create confusion. risks shifting attention forecast rate path. somewhat
 drawn somebody’s suggestion that, strong views, could indicate qualitatively

 think story important, think narrative important, minutesstyle narrative, discusses significant differences well common tendencies,
 important. process would helped submitting notes forecasts
 staff could aggregate modify listening meeting. hope submitting forecasts
 notes doesn’t make harder people change minds meeting. I’m little
 worried—and Governor Mishkin mentioned this—about shifting things forward
 meeting. makes information get little staler meeting. Already we’re getting
 something put together Wednesday Tuesday meeting; it’s already week stale.
 I’m also concerned that, everybody forecast circulates it, exchange
 views people change minds might little difficult
 written exactly want. need careful tendency, still
 think could submit narratives would help.
 I’d favor more-frequent updates. thinking quarterly, there’s
 President Yellen’s point three times year. long interval July
 February. Maybe ought start updating seven-month-or-so interval
 see whether want even frequently. think could update little
 frequently we’re doing. I’d keep focus variables—output,
 unemployment, inflation. key ones. I’d drop nominal income. We’re
 interested velocity anymore. variables, like housing markets energy prices, could
 covered narrative. would like formally convey measure uncertainty. I’d
 tempted use past forecast errors that. don’t think I’d like try fine-tune fan chart

 many years forecast cover: think arguments extending beyond

 Finally, attempt convey formally uncertainty surrounding

 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let make introductory remark,
 I’m going go questions fairly quickly. First, I’ve heard different reasons
 looking change. One issue improve credibility Fed. point
 credibility I’d like make trust issue. earn trust demonstrating
 achieve objectives organization. think credibility. Whether
 put forecast, credibility precious. don’t demonstrate ability
 control inflationary pace, we’re going lose credibility whether
 forecast. Accountability, too, important. central bank democracy, whatever
 enhance transparency—to let folks understand come policy
 choices—is important. use word “enhance”—President Lacker someone else used
 earlier, like word—because says things going well. always ways
 improve, looking change margin, major changes.
 also agree Government Mishkin others strength way
 central bank set country diversity viewpoints. get different
 regional inputs, also people different backgrounds sitting around table,
 whether Ph.D. economists experts monetary policy, experts Reserve Bank
 operations, folks private sector. come monetary policy different
 perspective. reason, go forward vein, support individual forecasts
 retaining diversity viewpoints. Therefore, don’t support common assumptions.
 us free choose framework produce forecasts. worry
 forcing common assumptions sort forces convergence, would likely
 support that.

 feel strongly important part issuing forecast narrative.
 put numbers out, don’t know value added have. numbers Greenbook don’t
 vary whole lot scenarios, narratives give different flavor. read
 scenarios, say, “Well, feel strongly way,” model doesn’t
 produce whole lot difference. think it’s essential talk
 narrative form. qualitative aspect really adds value forecast, particularly
 diversity views may occur time time. terms narrative,
 proposal Vice Chairman Geithner circulated good framework could use start.
 Again, meeting, may help timeliness communication.
 come time numbers, whether it’s tied minutes tied

 technical aspects forecast—again, based comments staff work,
 agree need keep things simple. Twice year sufficient, least initially, partly
 shouldn’t overcommunicate ability monetary policy fine-tune short-term
 variations inflation monetary policy. think life corporate CFO
 frustration held quarter quarter results company much going
 managing long term successfully. reason, lags
 monetary policy long, think we’re overcommitting—whether Congress,
 general public, markets—about ability implement affect markets
 short forecast period frequent forecast. However, going forward would lean toward
 forecast go longer. understand people want go
 think signals long-run real objectives are.
 want set objective, let’s set objective rather longer-term forecast

 long run we’re prone volatility timing, too,
 issue. also would favor three variables related mandate
 Congress—inflation, real GDP, unemployment rate—varieties
 determined, tied mandate. road could add more,
 let’s keep three.
 think it’s important communicate uncertainty surrounding forecast, would
 regard two dimensions. First, whatever consensus, five years I’ve
 here, periods know far policy going
 go. One instance started path raising interest rates, knew
 going go measured pace clearly signaled long period
 going felt confident 1 percent funds rate low. sure
 stopping point, knew long way go. Second, regarding central
 tendency, important signal rise uncertainty around turning points—that forecasts
 depend lot incoming data. Committee outlier really
 different viewpoints, need spend bit time narrative explaining
 difference views.
 comment would make that, thinking alternatives
 variability around them, challenge communicate effectively. should,
 suggested, dry runs. I’ve spending lot time recently Basel II, Pillar
 III, disclosures regarding uncertainty risk. Looking really control
 monetary policy differentiating things going on, style choose
 talking uncertainty risk regarding forecast important. think
 would good practice communication little first. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. try brief. impressed
 President Yellen’s excellent presentation thoughtfulness scope talked
 about, agree almost 100 percent everything said. want mention
 things think important. There’s old forecasting adage, you’ve ever
 forecasting business: can’t forecast well, forecast often. [Laughter] Now, suggests
 that, exercise forecast, might important
 frequently. purpose publishing information regular basis
 much forecast communicating policy views Committee
 broader audience. forecast almost byproduct, provides, view,
 foundation context current thinking current policy future policy.
 That’s really value me. Providing forecast narrative would provide richer
 context. would allow us perhaps little expansive things narrative.
 I’ll come back second. spend much time around table parsing words

 wouldn’t worry quite much every word parsed new meaning.

 helps stress importance uncertainty forecast going forward, think need

 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. views, associate closely
 President Stern. avoid going eight questions provide perhaps three
 thoughts President Stern talked about—first, dominant goal is;
 second, benefits going forward are; third, might go market
 something along lines.
 First, respect dominant goal, think, Governor Bies many others
 talked about, credibility. credibility today somewhat asymmetric, sense
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 195 255
 
 think lot credibility could lose exercise could
 gain. credibility institution high, would say even higher
 six months ago. suggests go slowly, conservatively,
 prudently process. relate forecasts? think
 forecasts considered yesterday fourth quarter, passed, I’d say
 staff better job anyone Wall Street many us could done alone,
 see errors involved—which criticism reality business we’re in.
 hesitate think making forecasts four times year, including periods quite far
 into, affects credibility. Instead extending third fourth year,
 would think making forecasts going-forward, rolling eight quarters way
 would always full two years front us. wouldn’t ways culpable
 making error information really know market’s expectation.
 strike little odd forecast period changes virtue current calendar. think
 credibility standpoint: don’t want mess front markets
 obviously.
 I’d put question frequencies context benefits trying
 achieve. seems predominant benefit strengthening transmission
 mechanism monetary policy us capital markets reaction function
 capital markets back us. provided forecasts four times year, fear numbers
 might replace markets’ forecasts. is, might say, “Well, I’m little bit

 terms quantitative qualitative information put forward, focus really

 Finally, would go forward whatever conclude, would

 I’ll go quickly questions. think it’s valuable different points
 view reflected forecast. Part value spirit Federal
 Reserve Act. forecast seen purely centralized would extent contrary
 act could raise hackles. valuable get differences views there.
 Whether common assumptions, guess differ bit
 everybody else is. think would worthwhile make effort we’re going
 dry runs see areas commonality would provide information.
 President Lacker said, clearer, centralized, consistent forecast,
 potentially informative accountable be. might
 worthwhile least explore whether aspects commonality wouldn’t
 cause inconsistencies models problems. I’m sure could get there,
 think worthwhile spend time that. Part motivation
 already put central tendency forecast couple times year. Although market
 respondents survey said want this, talk reporters market
 participants, don’t really seem pay much attention it, seems decay very,
 quickly. may pay attention short time, that’s might worthwhile
 see whether something bit consistent could given it. Right now, except
 small window around two times year put out, don’t see much emphasis
 it.
 It’s valuable more-rapid release information. However, last thing
 would want feel get faster feeling impeding
 
 January 30-31, 2007
 
 203 255
 
 decisionmaking process—either needing put Greenbook earlier constraining
 discussions already put line sand. think it’s 4.2, think it’s 3.2;
 memo there, memo better memo [laughter]—I think would
 mistake. Also, particularly since thinking frequency, release information three
 four times year, going get stale. trying get week sooner it’s
 three months week four months week, rather four months two
 weeks three months two weeks, isn’t helpful. don’t want undermine excellent
 decisionmaking process have. speed valuable, cost it, don’t
 see enormous benefit getting week two sooner. said, three four times
 year seems reasonable.
 like evolutionary approach providing narrative, think that’s one
 key things providing transparency—it gives us greater ability convey world
 we’re thinking things. also helps us would constrained
 words put Committee. would nice, principle, able
 use words convey ideas rather constrained. put information
 separate document, think get much attention. may valuable,
 also get different reactions. Right now, goes part testimony

 response.

 respect forecast horizon, think key whether explicit
 sort target goal, horizon related that. don’t want go
 far out. Council Economic Advisers, chaired so-called troika process,
 would Administration forecast. Initially ten-year forecasts.
 information today tell us anything ten years line?
 would always revert mean, would five-year period. Basically,

 Therefore, bit tentative three years.
