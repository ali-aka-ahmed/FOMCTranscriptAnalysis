 MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. forecast round, you,
 policymakers, faced identification problem similar we,
 econometricians, often confront. Although Greenbook forecast essentially

 Let begin citing areas forecast developments
 unfolded much anticipated. I’ll move areas

 weakness early year. particular, anticipating defense spending

 expect net exports largely reverse first-quarter drop. consequence,
 projecting real GDP advance pace bit 2½ percent

 economy probably expanding pace 2 percent first half
 year, rate projected March Greenbook.
 second major piece story appears receiving support
 incoming data forecast consumption growth would slow noticeably.
 projected step-down growth consumption important reason

 remains pace potential. Although far early claim victory,
 consumer spending goods flattened recent months sharp increases

 suggest forecast 2 percent growth real PCE current quarter

 third key element story last Greenbook that, even though

 whereas investment outside high tech transportation seems poised modest
 upturn second quarter sizable declines preceding six months.
 expected, purchases heavy trucks remain area notable weakness.
 Needless say, data investment volatile remain cautious
 concluding downside risk capital spending abated much. given
 recent track record area, might consider good news staff
 reports news.
 fourth element story that, least now, seems panning
 inventory overhangs emerged second half last year would
 worked relatively smoothly, rather cumulating something serious.
 motor vehicle sector, steep production cuts second half last year

 figures wholesale inventories March came assumed

 response, we’d probably add similar amount second-quarter estimate real
 GDP.
 Finally, another central element forecast labor demand would
 slow lagged response downshift growth overall activity.
 counseling patience face data area persistently surprised us
 upside. Last week’s labor market report provides least shred evidence
 support story. Private payrolls increased 63,000 April,
 downward revision 24,000 February—leaving level employment
 incorporated May Greenbook. Gains private payrolls averaged
 90,000 per month past three months, expect pace
 maintained remainder quarter. unemployment rate increased
 4.5 percent last month, also line projection.
 Putting pieces together, feeling bit confident story

 downside risks posed investment spending inventories—but

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. views economy haven’t
 changed much since last met aren’t terribly odds Greenbook. I’d highlight
 couple reasons concern, couple areas misses could severe. share
 views expressed many around table, recently Governor Kohn, inflation
 front. remain quite concerned inflation prospects, I’m keeping wary eye
 inflation expectations, particularly acceleration trends commodity
 prices foreign exchange value dollar. sense markets haven’t fully
 taken account could be, could find markets preoccupied
 inflation scare appear moment. think that, balance ’07,
 inflation risks tend significant growth risks, would expect see
 sequential increases GDP, Greenbook, go next several quarters.
 big point predicated really continued accommodation credit
 markets capital markets, several people noted.
 thinking projections and, look ’08 ’09, bigger risks
 tend policy oriented head next election, may well
 effect capital markets. think second half ’08 first half ’09

 likely GDP implications would be, can’t help think changes perceived
 changes tax policy trade policy could biggest drivers capital markets and,
 result, biggest effects macroeconomy. huge risks, look beyond
 ’07, terms GDP might come out; central case, Greenbook formulation
 looks roughly accord own.
 Let spend moment consumption. view broadly consistent others
 said earlier today. spoke past week one credit card company whose customer
 base similar average aggregate customer base United States.
 one-fifth credit card spending, reported April results, might
 provide us clues PCE growth credit quality. Card spending April,
 perspective, consistent moderate deceleration real consumption. ended
 April nominal year-over-year growth 4 percent non-auto retail sales,

 subprime portfolio—what subprime fallen level rather begun
 issued credit. Payment rates, use credit lines, delinquencies, chargeoffs—all positive levels little indication more-serious weakening consumer
 demand. So, again, think prospects outlined Greenbook terms PCE look
 broadly consistent April numbers.
 Let turn capital markets credit markets speak three
 four observations may bit newsworthy last met six weeks ago.
 First, talk little dearth defaults corporate loans, spend couple
 moments private equity, building Bill Dudley’s discussion outset correlation
 among asset classes, finally spend moment shakeout mortgage markets.
 predicate something know, several people spoken earlier
 today. corporate America become cautious, Wall Street become
 aggressive satisfy investors’ appetites risk. we’re seeing risk aversion one category
 Main Street real risk-seeking behavior Wall Street. Financial risk-taking remains high
 may well even increased since last met. you’ll look MOVE options index
 measuring one-month volatility Treasuries, it’s lowest nine years,
 since index came being, suggests President Minehan’s point forces
 liquidity froth might market probably present today us
 could imagined given tumult markets late February. time,
 nonfinancial corporate risk-taking continues subdued objective measures would
 suggest be. reason hope cap-ex data come around
 many us expected already, determination still needs done that.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 61 130
 
 hear, us even say, capital markets appear priced perfection,
 credit markets strong ever, liquidity plentiful. would add concern
 implausibility notion, President Geithner others spoke about. reason
 central bankers worry is, course, narrower spreads provide less shock
 absorber unforeseen events.
 Let go points mentioned outset describe
 implications decisions make. First dearth defaults corporate loans.
 Historically low year-ahead default rates referenced Greenbook, give
 us comfort, least theory. share Greenbook view corporate defaults increase
 profits level leverage increases normal levels. fewer defaults even
 possible financing environment, makes little less sanguine data.
 think covenant packages corporate loans, originated Wall Street
 originated community banks—I think President Yellen spoke previous meeting
 covenant-lite deals—it incredibly hard get defaults context loans, never mind
 event-of-default notices everything else would find way indentures.
 result, seen recent spate financings covenant packages increasingly
 issuer-friendly, without triggers would otherwise cause defaults: debt payment
 schedules, never mind even need make interest payments, ability turn
 sort pay-in-kind notes. that, strikes me, make us nervous business
 fundamentals shift abruptly investors left little opportunity gain access
 capital position force companies restructure operations. result
 less sanguine low default data continue receive Wall Street.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 62 130
 
 second point state private equity capital markets. note builds
 recent history we’ve seen: massive fund-raisings; larger LBOs; increasing leverage;
 past twelve months, we’ve seen so-called club deal phenomenon; growth equity
 bridges, others talked about; last met, discussed interest
 many firms rushing capital markets finding permanent capital.
 newest development growth syndication equity placement LBO markets.
 way syndicated debt markets matured incredibly past
 six ten years, equity side huge investments presently considered
 potentially made. one LBO sponsor might fund certain portion equity
 check LBO line up, equity syndicate manager traditional
 investment bank commercial bank, ability sell rest equity
 infrastructure distribution system built. doubt see syndication
 market five years deep large debt markets. think shows
 us new liquidity continues come even private placement 144(a) markets alongside
 growth public capital markets. liquidity could well improve tradability.
 extent syndications new, show us liquidity plentiful; also show
 us many new mechanisms stress-tested. implication
 boom private equity raised floor equity prices. sense
 private equity put may well replaced used thought Federal Reserve
 put floor equity prices, equity put appears larger ever been.
 Thus seen increased total leverage structured products; credit markets,
 I’ve mentioned, robust; question stress testing, still
 determined.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 63 130
 
 Another point capital markets relates Bill said correlation among
 asset classes. CEOs, CFOs, chief risk officers large financial firms found quite
 troubling greater correlation among asset classes internal models
 suggested. looked dashboards weeks tumult saw last
 February, grew increasingly uncomfortable whether accurately measured
 firms’ downside risks are. Certainly it’s encouraging, Bill showed us,
 appears less correlation recent weeks. That’s lesson learned relearned
 tested retested institutions. may heeding wakeup call good news,
 time tell whether enough catch problems arise market.
 final point concerns consequences shakeout mortgage markets.
 sense that, fallout subprime, market becoming consolidated larger,
 more-sophisticated lenders quickly provide markets satisfy customers’
 newest wants. success markets investment banks hedge funds go
 scale, strong distribution systems, control servicing
 businesses, effectively able engineer workouts avoid need foreclose.
 think balance year hear news small medium-sized
 commercial banks feel though market share taken away tumult,
 something need continue observe. that, Mr. Chairman, I’ll save
 rest comments next round.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. last time met, one theme greater
 uncertainty, Governor Kohn mentioned feeling greater uncertainty ever
 had. sure greater uncertainty tenor comments today,
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 64 130
 
 think greater uncertainty downside risk. key issue last time think
 still us certainly saw evidence slowdown and, President Stern mentioned,
 sometimes acknowledge reality, much slower growth many
 people expecting two previous meetings. Greenbook suggests
 slowdown unlikely persist—and broadly agree view, many people around
 table—but want review five key uncertainties talked last time discuss
 developed likely go.
 first uncertainty investment, course, lot us spoken that.
 would rate level uncertainty still elevated there. going use color coding rate
 uncertainty, would say still elevated. recently gotten more-solid
 numbers, recent; think still glimmer hope something
 bank going get turnaround investment. seen better
 numbers ISM, durable goods, forth says direction perhaps little positive
 thinking six weeks ago. still reasonable amount uncertainty
 whether pickup business investment help offset slowdown consumption make
 sure continue grow 2 percent range going forward.
 second uncertainty productivity potential output. Obviously still
 elevated level. far concerned, one biggest challenges us think
 intermediate run. particular, downside scenario concerns that,
 pickup investment, unlikely see sustained rise productivity growth. perhaps one
 reason lower investment concerns productivity growth returns
 investment, could fairly negative scenario get much lower potential
 output. Offsetting concern seeing glimmers hope investment.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 65 130
 
 respect potential, think appropriate Greenbook raised participation rates bit,
 given older people seem healthier previous cohorts seem willing
 work. However, think big question mark is, exactly David said, August
 get better feel way data revision go difference two
 sides balance sheet fairly big. Broadly, share Gary Stern’s optimism good
 bet bet U.S. economy ultimately good productivity growth.
 concern fully understand slowness investment recovery
 productivity slowdown. potentially worrying downside scenario there.
 Third uncertainty housing market subprime. Well, obviously,
 uncertainty subprime highly elevated then, come quite bit. seen
 tightening lending standards, particularly lower end. survey senior loan
 officers asked differentiation subprime prime lending standards. showed
 dramatic increase subprime standards, exactly would expect kind
 market, certainly potentially reducing demand least lower end housing market.
 housing market itself, uncertainty still there. still lot
 uncertainty whether numbers telling us weather actual strength
 market. think mentioned number before, need have, besides Dave,
 meteorologist staff forecast weather every number hear housing
 market number put stock; heat cold rain
 snow whatever thing Mother Nature may throw us. still think pretty
 mixed picture there. said, seen little evidence spillovers subprime
 market. main concern, variation Governor Warsh said, something
 Congress might might cut market. mindful actions
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 66 130
 
 may taking respect guidance, well actions Congress may
 taking, could reduce market otherwise.
 yield curve favorable lot variable-rate subprime borrowers move
 fixed-rate products, payment shock perhaps 50 basis points.
 delinquencies seeing due resets payment shock.
 due primarily so-called juvenile delinquents—the early defaulters going bad.
 means know coming line really seen
 experience resets. Now, recently benign yield curve, situation could reasonably
 worked out. key whether equity left. equity left resets come,
 guys likely walk. risk layering—putting really money down—and
 prices go down, problem. think may bit slow burn. Coupled
 broader misalignment seeing little increase housing starts,
 ways would see positive, sort negative given housing sales seem
 declining much. Thus seems disconnect supply demand, think
 Greenbook quite wisely saying likely longer transition housing
 market.
 fourth area uncertainty talked last time financial markets—the
 dramatic spike volatility. volatility spike come down, we, good
 economists, never satisfied either high volatility low volatility. Low volatility
 concern us, much share concerns Tim, Cathy, Kevin, others
 mentioned. United States, also rest world,
 spreads bit narrower otherwise would be. particular, concerns banks
 chasing private equity deals going covenant-free. many discussions private equity
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 67 130
 
 folks, instead saying, well, bring us capital, contacts ones saying
 banks pushing take greater leverage otherwise would want. Now, isn’t
 fox guarding henhouse, know is. want banks disciplinary
 force, would potentially taking large risks real concern.
 fifth area uncertainty consumption. seen bit step-down
 consumption growth, still lot uncertainty, share exact concerns
 Governor Kohn articulated; given likely wealth effects, even though
 offsetting effects stock market, want bet offsetting effects
 stock market next three quarters. Housing wealth seems flattening,
 coming down, Case-Shiller index average ten markets 3 5 percent.
 people’s thinking consumption pattern based increase housing wealth,
 saving rate least gradually increase. point, reality may biting
 leading concern.
 inflation front, again, continuing uncertainty drives
 short-term intermediate-term inflation. mentioned last time, get very, mild effects
 traditional things think make difference. Oil, energy, commodity prices,
 resource utilization don’t seem much force, short intermediate terms
 think leaning positive side rather negative side. still
 owners’ equivalent rent issue coming transition housing market still
 extent temporarily pushing measured inflation rates. Inflation expectations continue
 seem quite well contained, that, think, key because, given forces
 seem important short intermediate run, inflation expectations important.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 68 130
 
 bottom line that, although see downside risks growth, think Greenbook
 scenario reasonable central tendency one, see important upside risks inflation.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would characterize compared
 last meeting gone soft patch, extensive
 expected. basic longer-term outlook really one last time
 around. really relevant policy decisions policy decisions
 affect economy year two road.
 Looking issue risks, worried last meeting
 happening business fixed investment, particularly really understand
 going on; always case that, Knightian uncertainty, get much
 nervous. numbers come bit better grounds, little less worried
 business fixed investment. downshift housing,
 unexpected. put things together, think situation fair amount
 uncertainty. Maybe little less worried uncertainty downside risk,
 although think still there, housing case, point view
 longer-run fundamentals, see big problem. really inventory-correction issue,
 trying sort out. creating uncertainty, creates uncertainty
 shorter term rather longer term. Even though still uncertainty issue
 business fixed investment, may little bit less. perhaps slight skew
 downside terms confidence intervals, little less last time, gives
 comfort.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 69 130
 
 inflation issue, optimistic Greenbook. see inflation coming
 2.1 percent end 2007 2 percent staying thereafter.
 reasoning here, think, familiar you. consider long-run inflation expectations key
 driver inflation process. see numbers around 2 percent, unless make
 concerted effort change inflation expectations, think stay. Also,
 confident right thing make sure inflation expectations go
 there, think markets similar confidence regard.
 look risks terms inflation, concern issue
 happened structural productivity. numbers coming really cannot fully
 explain. Maybe something bit wrong Okun’s law, productivity revert
 back it, we’re okay. maybe actually something more,
 tight labor markets when, fact, economy growing quite slow pace.
 real question may mean. structural productivity actually downshifting
 expect, create serious inflation risk concerned about.
 side issue whether really tight labor markets. look
 numbers terms compensation forth, don’t look bad. might tell us

 Broadly speaking, outlook participants substantially changed since March.

 market expectations might well entrenched 2½ consequence
 willingly openly default—by revealed preference, will—moved effectively raise
 comfort zone. much hardliner this. think ought continue
 comfort zone 1 2, ought think inflation target 1½ plus minus

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole’s comments remind
 question, Vincent. is, think effect term “on balance”

 MR. REINHART. added term “on balance” drafting Bluebook

 looking one monthly number. may complicated analysis
 President Stern looking three-, six-, twelve-month changes. Second, crosssectional aspect it. focused one number core PCE, you’re taking

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, let’s say core inflation, wouldn’t every

 MR. REINHART. Yes, hanging hat necessarily PCE versus

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Sorry? little more?

 virtue truth. [Laughter] could interpret it, relative March, softer

 sometimes little softer sometimes little stronger, think maybe slightly thinner

 that. But, Vince, think would plausible reading market change?
 would interpret intent change section 2?
 MR. REINHART. recognition incoming information. think

 anything says Committee looking soft patch, without using phrase “soft

 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, may ask question?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly.
 MR. FISHER. advocating that, use text written section 3
 alternative B, would still keep full wording section 4 last time?
 MR. REINHART. wording section 4 would unchanged, yes.
 MR. FISHER. may mitigate concerns have.
 MR. REINHART. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Since bringing suggestions early, one thing
 could section 2, second sentence, simply make assertion moderate

 would also observe certainly far-fetched imagine—although forecast—
 unemployment rate measure slack may move time inflation
 remains stubbornly even increases touch. leads favor
 language alternative C one sentence.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. President Stern, would add words output side?
 think it’s worth emphasizing uncertainty inflation without also emphasizing uncertainty
 output? Although lot people said narrowed relative last time, lot
 people also said housing situation uncertain.
 MR. STERN. haven’t thought that. want say economy seems
 likely expand, could, suppose, soften bit emphasize uncertainty well,
 although sense things people do, fact, expect moderate growth going forward.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Intervention, President Fisher?
 MR. FISHER. No, sir. want comment.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. don’t go ahead.

 MR. FISHER. Well, again, probably bearish terms short-term forecast
 GDP growth asymmetric confidence bands, take account even slower
 growth that. listened conversation table keying word
 “hawkish” Vince used, want owlish growth terms listening President Stern’s
 admonition, don’t want pigeon inflation—just kill aviary context here.
 [Laughter] would advocate alternative B. don’t believe change rate. like
 much suggestion President Stern made inflation.
 thing summary list, Mr. Chairman, hear think
 issue behavioral pattern private-sector leaders trying figure
 preserve margins; therefore, think sustained price “instincts” would
 otherwise see current data. think second sentence alternative C captures
 uncertainty, agree President Stern. Finally, always, would suggest add
 word “global” “resource utilization.” Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Noted. Thank you.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, may ask clarifying question
 discussion?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. raised obvious question, whether
 want introduce characterization uncertainty one piece outlook other.
 But, Gary, suggest uncertainty inflation forecast greater today
 March?
 MR. STERN. personally. thought listened
 conversation, uncertainty seemed least great March. fact,

 Greenbook marked core inflation touch. doesn’t lead directly greater uncertainty,

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. rationale mostly greater uncertainty,

 MR. STERN. agree comment 100 percent, although think issue

 MR. FISHER. May make intervention, Mr. Chairman?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.
 MR. FISHER. use sentence, might able get rid first

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. interventions? not, President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Gosh, usual state play gotten confused—for me,
 anyway. First all, thing least confused policy recommendation.
 think anything time. think stay course 5¼. much
 favor alternative B.
 Second, want comment Vince said reaction statement
 last time, large part found people talked past
 several weeks felt statement communication somehow murkier usual,
 possible. Personally, felt clear statement—we saw
 two-sided risk—and ultimately market come around belief. guess come
 view bad thing market reacted bit strongly. probably
 anticipated that, think even commented last meeting—that
 make change open two-way possibility policy little explicitly, bigger
 impact overall market.
 Third, regard discussion language alternative B, opinion
 terms growth certain set risks coming housing market rising
 energy gasoline prices, extent offset continued strength employment,
 financial market adding household wealth, growth around rest world,

 bit balanced somewhat less uncertain last time inflation part

 that, might say nuanced discussion inflation.
 expect inflation—we Boston somewhat less rest you—to moderate next year
 year half something within people called comfort zone.
 little worried might send message concern might intended
 replacing language, although agree President Stern. think language
 alternative C, particularly regard uncertainty, somewhat reflective talked
 around table existing language section 3.
 Finally, may kidding here, taking language section 3
 saying much we’re committed comfort zone 1 2, although take
 President Poole’s comments seriously, rather dynamics inflation risk
 inflation would accelerate rather decelerate concerned about.
 Again, personal reading context think
 concerns inflation time. would agree President Poole way
 read gradually pushing us giving target target range,
 may everybody wants go here. know, think little risk around

 wondering whether really want push inflation sheer sake pushing

 show stopper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like everyone else, support policy
 recommendation alternative B, keeping fed funds rate unchanged. think best

 Financial conditions right now, several people remarked, really quite supportive
 growth, particularly business sector, think necessary offset drag
 housing business household caution. recent indicators, seems me,
 still bit mixed character. one month strength capital spending,

 mind still considerable uncertainty, even less last time, around output path.
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 88 130
 
 Given think things close before, wouldn’t make many
 changes wording last time. comfortable section 2 economic growth
 “expand moderate pace coming quarters,” unless add something uncertainty
 inflation piece, would want add uncertainty other. think
 ought add uncertainty language inflation. think combination
 “predominant” language, President Fisher implicitly pointing out, send much
 concerned message inflation. say concerns inflation increased
 since last time—I really think would interpreted way. cost, obtained
 flexibility characterizing situation policy expectations changes
 made last time final section. would keep final section same, would
 something undo that, would combine uncertainty language inflation
 predominant risk language. think world would see Federal Reserve much
 worried inflation last time, even though data little better.
 section 3, “core inflation remains somewhat elevated balance”—one question asked
 was, 2 percent target latest number 2.1, much concerned
 that, would comfortable sentence. think okay sentence
 couple reasons. I’ll come “on balance” second. One reason latest data

 much acceleration PCE. market-based PCE shows acceleration. rate

 Several individuals have, agree President Poole Vincent could get
 awkward soon—but yet—and need think it. Committee
 comfort zone. regard phrase “on balance,” could live sentence either way.
 Unfortunately it’s ambiguous phrase. I’m sure people interpret it. thought
 would hawkish take out? didn’t follow dialogue Vincent Vice
 Chairman Geithner thought effect would section without “on

 MR. REINHART. theory smoothing recent data that,
 got another good reading core inflation, last month, wouldn’t necessarily
 weight much.
 MR. DUDLEY. Don, could take “on balance” acknowledging last month’s data,
 take “on balance” out, you’re acknowledging last month’s data much.
 MR. REINHART. May also ask question? President Stern’s formulation,
 would take second sentence alternative C make reference resource slack?
 would actually take markets reading decided totally discount current
 pressures employment rather increasing weight inflation uncertainty. took
 invitation say disregard employment—you worried slack much,
 asserting inflation moderates.
 MR. KOHN. hadn’t thought that, confess. makes even

 MR. HOENIG. Anticipating linguist reading afterward, let say
 strongly support alternative B. Since I’m assuming language we’re talking about,
 support current language even though many suggestions modifications.
 inclined make suggestions accept others put

 couple comments, though. Governor Kohn mentioned would
 long period experience below-trend growth; perspective, that’s

 that, ought staying. comfortable modestly tight

 Kohn’s earlier comment way minimal cost economy,
 objective: bring inflation least costly way possible. need
 stick policy defined here. would also point out, record,

 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. step back discussion
 think policy position, we’re difficult position inflation continues

 said summary comments, Mr. Chairman. think alternative B—keeping

 take suggestion using sentence alternative C considerable uncertainty

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.

 uncertainty inflation higher rather lower. statement would somewhat
 hawkish and, fact, reflective people’s balance concern was.
 totally agreement need change language right now, want

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Well, I, too, support alternative B, simple logic: haven’t

 it’s good prescription us send markets figure us.
 [Laughter]
 strongly favor alternative B. think markets read change section 2—
 say, “Economic growth slowed first part year”—as “We believe April
 well quite mediocre.” think that’s means. That’s believe,
 change justified facts. terms “on balance” language section 3, could live
 either way, don’t see compelling reason adding “on balance.” think markets still
 want see us reflection believe. believe we’re cutting,
 credibility inflation real, we’re little cute now. wouldn’t want give

 inflation. one data point, I’d prefer leave without “on balance”

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think mean brake. [Laughter] Anyway, thank
 you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. everyone else said, haven’t enough data lead us

 reasonable me—rather saying “nevertheless,” assert “recent indicators suggest

 Chairman suggested starting sentence “overall.” people like phrase “on
 balance,” say “on balance recent indicators suggest . . .” [laughter] depending
 whether choose use phrase “on balance” next sentence. next sentence,
 I’m open whether use “on balance,” would, balance, go taking
 don’t see particular benefit point adding qualification.
 sense takes away bit flexibility rather adding it. I’m trying think
 likely scenarios going forward, it’s likely might want remove alter
 phrase keep it. time-series perspective going forward, might leave us
 little flexibility put in, don’t strong view that.
 see comments, think shouldn’t changing things much.
 principle, I’m sympathetic Gary’s proposal, right time make
 change. question interpretation “high resource utilization.” take
 central tendency discussion, we’re going see growth around 2 percent so, clearly
 potential. doesn’t suggest high level resource utilization. given Chairman
 mentioned likely changes employment growth, time next meeting
 may adding 0.1 0.2 percentage point unemployment rate, would 0.3
 percentage point higher quite recently, although it’s still broadly relatively low
 level. change would bring us back higher level we’ve seen quite months.
 mindful that. I’m suggesting take out,
 think change high level resource utilization going

 I’ve trying decide “on balance.” couple thoughts.
 inclination listened conversation—and would happy take poll
 whatever—is strike following grounds: moving statement said
 “recent readings core inflation” one says simply “core inflation.” implication
 seems we’re referring last couple months really
 broader measure core inflation. So, again, conservative spirit, avoid adding
 language, mild preference dropping phrase, I’m open comment that.
 respect ongoing discussion implications language
 inflation target, going address that. moment ask Governor Kohn
 talk bit communications. chance next meeting talk
 statement. hope talking statement address issues much

 May 9, 2007

 risks. Obviously, won’t able nail down, opportunity
 try come broader view statement’s role would larger
 communication strategy. That’s another reason slightly conservative point.
 thinking ahead, President Stern’s suggestion sentence “Inflation pressures seem likely
 moderate time, considerable uncertainty surrounds judgment” might place
 go point. might want change derivative, instead talking level,
 could say still expecting improvement, lot uncertainty
 it. sort shifts level direction. might solution, come point

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. points, building

 Committee publish fed funds rate path, collecting understand
 people’s policy assumptions fit forecast. question
 whether assume appropriate policy or, Chairman suggested, whether

 long we’re dry runs, that’s presumption. We’ll find something
 Committee thinks, Committee discuss wants characterize
 assumptions.
 discuss experience dry run now. However, within next couple
 days ask staff survey Committee reactions went,
 could improved, aspects least helpful, whether ways use
 even policy discussion, things—now you’ve
 once—that you’d like see staff didn’t get.
 issue circulating individual submissions? staff extract key issues
 submissions circulate list key issues ahead time? lots things

 next dry run would helpful get information funds rate assumptions back

 know Vince gave us indication people actually used submitted it.
 I’d make suggestion next go-round information included internal

 MR. KOHN. don’t include survey see whether people want
 not?
 MR. PLOSSER. Fine.
 MR. KOHN. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. I’d second little transparent within Committee
 fed funds rate. Compared elements sausage factory get revealed

 though, looking charts, really struck dispersion inflation forecasts

 think dry run go arguably going different, mind
 argues coming closure sooner rather later.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. want mention—I don’t know true people—
 two big problems dry run. though come
 survey, feeling people might views this. One problem
 really difficulty thinking confidence interval didn’t feel
 enough background staff think it. It’s fault
 didn’t ask it. problem. knew Greenbook errors
 terms confidence interval. knew FRB/US confidence intervals were,
 issue think them. think things say that.
 example, context FRB/US, don’t assume model uncertainty.
 issue think uncertainty might exist FRB/US errors, then,
 problems Greenbook forecast errors, display greater uncertainty
 FRB/US errors. memo really think through, might provide lot
 background us think this. might need go
 next dry run, discussion that.
 problem figuring write issue appropriate policy,
 central. Again, relates issue discussed, use appropriate policy
 2 percent inflation goal think that’s one I’m comfortable with. It’s also
 
 May 9, 2007

 consistent think revealed preference Committee terms
 policy actions we’ve taken. However, would also comfortable Committee built
 consensus 1½ percent. would different view projections
 would felt policies case would different. question mark
 think future gray area makes exercise
 difficult. need think it. That’s struggled sat
 asked, “How actually going this?”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. know, we’re going talk lot
 substantive issues this. thought, we’re going it, let’s now. you’ve
 raised questions. I’m looking clock. suggestion this. don’t know
 planning June—June two-day meeting, right?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Right.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. don’t think conversations
 next round. Let’s make sure give time June beyond
 start talk this—so didn’t speak today initial reactions
 aren’t left without opportunity engage there’s whole range things
 could address, including three issues raised far.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. take Vice Chairman Geithner’s comments seriously, want
 raise one thing would like get survey. offered one way
 reflecting uncertainty regarding forecasts. might ways—for example, alternative
 scenarios, qualitative discussions risk, sort thing—that seem us
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 110 130
 
 preferable. phrase question would draw us ways might
 like characterize risks around forecast, think would helpful I, one,
 find range distribution errors kind difficult.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. logistical question, Don. survey, thought heard
 say going send next couple days?
 MR. KOHN. would like to. didn’t look Vincent said that. [Laughter]
 mean, think ought get feedback soon.
 MR. MOSKOW. question iteration we’re going go
 now, commenting staff draft next two weeks. think would good
 us go experience send survey out.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good point. Remind us update
 projections?
 MR. REINHART. opening business tomorrow.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Fine. have, guess, rest day update
 projections like. [Laughter] Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. want underscore point. It’s clear
 providing median 70 percent confidence bands going useful markets.
 think think useful markets. important convey
 sense uncertainty—and much look forward memo Rick asked for.
 academics never think terms 70 percent confidence intervals; think 90 95
 percent confidence intervals. I’m sure besides readers Bluebook
 Greenbook think 70 percent confidence intervals. thinking alternative ways
 
 May 9, 2007
 
 111 130
 
 convey something useful markets sense uncertainty, without giving false
 sense precision 3.0 2008 3.4 2009, may better sensible way go.
 think look odd putting something like out, I’m sure would actually helpful.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. want say exercise already success
 terms kinds questions it’s making us confront. appreciate everyone taking
 seriously. good, detailed responses everyone.
 Let close meeting quick announcements. First, next meeting
 two days—June 27 June 28. receive additional information nonpolicy
 part discussion. Second, usual, night June 27, we’ll dinner
 British Embassy. number us concerned late night,
 discussion ambassador, we’ve agreed program speaker.
 evening strictly social, therefore maybe we’ll get little earlier
