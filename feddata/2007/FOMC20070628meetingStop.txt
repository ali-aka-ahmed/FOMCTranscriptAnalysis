 Three factors behind backup Treasury yields bear mentioning. First,
 shift monetary policy expectations rise longer-dated yields
 global phenomenon. yields rising elsewhere, shift put
 upward pressure U.S. long-term rates. Second, mortgage-related convexity
 hedging may exacerbated speed magnitude rise yields. rise
 yields causes expected rates prepayment lower-coupon fixed-rate mortgages
 fall, lengthens average duration mortgage portfolios. Mortgage
 servicers, housing-related GSEs, mortgage holders respond selling
 long-dated Treasury securities long-dated interest rate swaps reduce
 average duration holdings. Exhibit 9 shows conventional fixed-rate
 mortgages current mortgage rates. rates rise, mortgages get
 “out money.” lowers expected prepayment rates lengthens

 Although calm generally pervades U.S. financial markets, one important
 exception worthy note. subprime mortgage space still unsettled—hurt

 Regarding consumption, offsetting wealth effects

 First obviously direct effect prices. Case-Shiller ten-city index
 suggests prices fall 3 percent next year. Now, that’s roughly
 market issues subprime arose end February,
 actually better last fall. markets don’t think
 enormous challenge respect prices, least ten markets. President
 Poole mentioned, sometimes prices even improved indexes, like CaseShiller index, may lag what’s going may accurately reflect underlying actual
 values people realize. still may challenges even though index
 suggests house prices 3 percent. also interesting look delta,
 change index. haven’t really seen much that, think heartening,
 still something watch for.
 Second indirect effects, wealth effects. mentioned,

 Now, think finesse problem time being. Assuming

 support alternative B’s language. want say two things. First,
 substantive concern—I think Governor Kohn’s thoughts inflation pressures

 “inflation.” It’s little bit general. clear goal, would beneficial.
 Given don’t clear goal, think talking pressures good. also
 value forward looking. Two, amendment fits President Stern’s
 notion try keep much parallel previous statement.
 mentioning moderation inflation pressures—I’m sure wrote properly
 whether Governor Kohn suggested final sentence section 3 “the potential
 sustain pressures,” taking back parallel before, whether said
 “sustain inflation.” would certainly agree “those pressures.” Three, putting
 “pressures” gets us potential getting stuck. saying “sustained
 moderation inflation yet convincingly demonstrated.” Well, take

 would mean two projections would appear context Monetary Policy

 could make better—to include information, include boxes, essentially
 make more-effective publication. would be, now, twice year. Perhaps
 quarters could small release sort, could include projections

 Third, think projections ought project total inflation measure.
 many people noted, confusion—and even resentment, would say—
 appears excessive attention core inflation. Projecting total inflation
 measure throughout projection would, first all, clarify definition price

 things try forecast overall inflation.

 One issue discussing appropriate period achieving price

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That’s okay. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. asked comment long
 list questions concerning economic projections, minutes, statement.
 addition, Governor Kohn put broader question general thrust
 direction we’re going in, I’d like focus remarks latter. Frankly, right
 think important question regarding release projections concerns
 relationship communication devices inflation objective. Everything else
 less small potatoes right now. believe would mistake release
 projections without agreeing communicating Committee inflation objective. It’s
 inevitable; fact, it’s intended way described it, Mr. Chairman, participants’
 third-year inflation projections interpreted equivalent objective. think
 would problematic without explicit statement objective number
 reasons.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 153 261
 
 First, projections display nontrivial dispersion, admittedly narrow range,
 market participants going keen interest whether believe 1.9 percent
 inflation rate, say, high right. Financial market participants already
 believe there’s dispersion Committee members’ preferred inflation rate
 lies 1½ 2 percent. note showing every individual preferred
 inflation rate spans range 1½ 2 percent equivalent Committee’s deciding
 collective preferred inflation rate anything within band 1½ 2 percent.
 don’t think going enhance clarity public’s understanding
 intentions much all.
 Second, communicating inflation objective via three-year-out projections would
 accomplish little way enhancing commitment since we’d release projections
 anew three four times year implication implied objective could change
 time. I’ll remind brother-in-law retirement benefit
 projections, make important point significant part value
 announced objective reduce long-run uncertainty inflation.
 Third, inflation projections would displayed alongside exactly analogous
 projections unemployment GDP growth exactly analogous way. would
 confuse people economics monetary policy. context, convey
 numerical targets unemployment growth? convey
 inflation variable control medium long run, cannot peg
 growth unemployment one number sustained way? words,
 remind people long-run Phillips curve virtually vertical? related
 consideration that, present projections way clearly state
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 154 261
 
 inflation objectives, it’s hard imagine someone Congress trying hold us
 accountable unemployment projection inflation projections. would
 dramatic step backward us, think.
 Fourth, probably pressing immediate problem view,
 publishing projections way nothing improve clarity internal
 deliberations alleviate problems continue writing
 statements absence agreed-upon objective.
 reasons, believe release economic projections containing
 participants’ forecasts inflation three years would poor ineffective substitute
 explicitly articulated objective would problematic without objective.
 Now, let clear. think move ahead direction, applaud
 leadership, Mr. Chairman, putting something table today outset
 discussion. think conjunction inevitable step
 agreeing we’re Committee. appreciate sensitivity
 likelihood various politicians may react communication explicit numerical
 objective; past thirty years, politicians reacted many actions

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, like President Moskow, find
 difficult find disagreement propose. I’m supportive
 approach you’ve laid reasons articulated clearly. support extending
 forecast period. mentioned going third year; also suggested maybe threeto-five-year average. I’m leaning toward three-to-five-year average
 proposed five-year extension forecast period—the two years currently use
 adding fifth year. three-to-five-year average makes perfect sense
 me.
 I’m supportive using total inflation number. President Hoenig mentioned
 preference total CPI reasons mentioned: It’s
 measure public currently understands, gets lot publicity.
 point out, start using PCE deflator, public start focus measure.
 like approach quarterly releases projections. seems appropriate.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 159 261
 
 Last year saw release forecasts twice year, become
 outdated rather quickly. giving information quarterly basis would allow us
 keep forecasts current. would like us spend time talking whether
 assume optimal policy because, Governor Kohn pointed out, we’re going get

 Earlier advocated CPI. I’m still perhaps margin, that’s big
 issue one way other. agree timing—the forecast projections ought
 based information available meeting, subsequent information. fact, that’s
 important we’re trying communicate decisionmaking process. I’m
 fairly happy way staff crafted language. think done pretty
 good job capturing sense. I’m rather indifferent whether incorporate
 minutes directly make addendum. Again, think markets group
 live either way, people read minutes come understand
 accept one way another.
 two points trouble perhaps little disagreement
 Governor Kohn’s comments concern optimal policy whether reveal what’s
 implicit fed funds rate forecast going forward. think revealing dispersion
 varying underlying policy assumptions people using going forward helps
 issue uncertainty—that world uncertain understanding way
 macroeconomy works uncertain. revealing underlying sets assumptions
 Committee making get set objectives different could
 actually helpful reinforcing view future uncertain. Therefore, rather
 locking us path, may end up, fact, opening options us way
 might before. think there’s actually potential information
 we’re providing marketplace may valuable. Giving area bit
 thought might worthwhile.
 second point one President Pianalto mentioned, occurred

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Minehan.

 much favor forecast process working on. don’t

 like way Vice Chairman Geithner talked beginnings ends.
 One thing I’ve struck whole communication process hard
 move backward one starts something. nearly impossible take
 away. think beginnings ends, need careful taking
 step time. Even though might seem reasonable take five steps, try
 one, see works, move there. Giving forecast four times year;
 going three years, three five; showing balance things range
 Committee would see things turning would be, would say
 harmony Vice Chairman Geithner, “a good step.”

 MR. KROSZNER. Thanks. also want say supportive

 questions concerns raised interventions earlier indicated

 close call. really addresses lot potential concerns had. also think it’s
 extremely good putting us proper evolutionary path. well know,

 said, won’t go individual pieces. let mention couple things.
 Actually, along lines Chairman said focusing PCE

 correct. also think may issues existing contracts,
 important point think about.
 point President Lacker raised also important one think about:
 different numbers going perceived? Obviously, focusing lot
 particular number inflation, putting numbers

 Again, endogenous response, quarterly, likely

 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Clearly, discussion far—
 prediction continue way—there tremendous amount
 support outline presented, share that. want focus two
 points Richard raised maybe hit little harder. First, fed funds path,
 fed funds rate policy instrument. don’t want confuse public
 difference policy instrument policy goals. want present
 something, ought present policy rule fed funds rate determined.
 don’t know beyond broad outlines Taylor rule,
 point emphasizing. opposed presenting fed funds
 rate path think really going confuse communication.
 Now, issue false precision, want use analogy hope
 help explain issue. Let use GPS analogy. calculation
 correctly, GPS coordinates usually show instrument thousandth
 minute longitude, let’s say. calculation correctly, that’s six feet.
 policy purposes, perhaps locating piers suspension bridge, would
 really like another digit. GPS instrument can’t produce digit.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 180 261
 
 try repeated trials, would get random garbage. Therefore,
 locating bridge piers, use different measuring device. Now,
 said, “What difference 1.9 1.8?” Well, beyond
 measurement accuracy lot data. doesn’t much
 policy relevance, really beyond measurement accuracy, multiple
 measures inflation. take PCE index, look without
 nonmarket components. relationships change, therefore really making
 mistake force make judgments 0.1 percentage point.
 projections, ought round things appropriate number significant
 digits. Standard scientific practice present measurements run beyond
 accuracy measuring instruments. appropriate number significant
 digits business? look nature revisions, multiple measures,
 forth, would propose GDP inflation probably 0.5 percentage
 point. unemployment rate, maybe 0.25 percentage point. really
 going tie knots stuff like fourth digit GPS
 instrument. doesn’t measurement validity it.
 Part problem presenting histograms organized around
 fine intervals display differences totally insignificant
 don’t amount anything. present it, people start thinking must
 think means something. think really aggravate communication
 process, therefore ought look appropriate number significant
 digits is. trying obfuscate differences. trying make sure
 focus differences genuine. real difference 0.5 percentage

 point apart, well it. reason view shouldn’t present
 explain it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. strongly support proposals
 laid out. appreciate so. helped focus discussion.
 Besides agreeing proposals, also agree reasoning set
 right step important step. doesn’t go way
 single agreed-upon inflation objective, think it’s major step
 direction. Given political realities sensitivities differences opinion
 comfort level moving wholly direction, think constructive
 step. moves us forward, doesn’t preclude measured steps later on.
 would worry take step huge difference among us
 quantitative definition appropriate price stability objective. clear
 range difference broad; 1½ 2 grand scheme things seems
 minor. Certainly, point going third year, seems me,
 informative public.
 really like idea that, talked individual comfort zones,
 able get current phase reluctant talk topic
 all. would good express speeches something reflects
 Committee objective. think 1½ 2 range think price stability
 adequate useful. let us clearly explain objectives
 strategy using monetary policy achieve them, something really haven’t
 done much of, think that’s good thing do.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 182 261
 
 really torn proposal whether go beyond
 three years. lucky point awfully close range
 think would like in. future date lot
 objective, could easily imagine—given view tradeoffs
 employment inflation goals—that three years would insufficient period
 look projection see view price stability was. future
 date, range short could problematic. However, going three
 five years disadvantage will, effect, laying something
 Congress likely view employment goal unemployment goal,
 worried taking step. really torn it.
 bit specifics—I think four times year appropriate. like
 sharing projections among Committee members; helpful
 understanding people think facilitating discussion. think
 staff done wonderful job producing narrative. major thing
 provide public lay reasoning economy. nicely
 done, think really good shape. like idea total inflation
 number. like CPI familiarity could certainly live PCE
 well. like “appropriate policy.” lot concerns Committee
 projecting fed funds rate. past President Plosser
 terms wanting reveal public, many good reasons
 advanced discussions shouldn’t that, least now.
 respect concern that, specific submissions,
 eventually become public, feeling that, round, asking people “Do
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 183 261
 
 agree Greenbook?” “Are significant differences?” quite
 informative sufficient.
 like treatment uncertainty round. Asking people put
 numbers false precision—I really didn’t like that. Providing table
 model-based forecast-based historical averages helpful combined
 qualitative discussion. little worried histograms. nice
 graphical devices. really informative something want inform
 public about? share concerns expressed outliers
 whether want focus attention them. respect timing
 forecasts, really think adding information projections
 goes beyond meeting. confusing try so.
 feel projections finalized either day FOMC meeting
 shortly thereafter based additional information.
 respect publication, agree President Moskow’s thoughts
 putting projections appendix minutes desirable, though
 careful say discussion. also include
 Monetary Policy Report. like idea expediting minutes, especially
 figure way able read Blackberrys. ought able
 that—most compression time cut two half weeks comes
 terms response time. think respond quickly, especially
 get we’re traveling. like idea able use minutes

 write first part minutes present staff’s information
 brought meeting, also take burden minutes, hope
 take burden staff.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also think straw-man

 projections quarterly seeing responses get. tend think going
 learn quite bit process. others said, economic

 finally telling going give answer key
 tell we’re thinking. sufficient
 constituency, time revisit doing.
 terms details, refer three items. First, whether
 making projections appropriate policy sharing fed funds rate path,
 incredibly concerned policy forecasts would misunderstood policy
 commitments. Again, think would undermine much good work we’ve
 done. Second, regarding anonymity projections points President
 Fisher made, little uncomfortable even numbers 1 19
 projections think veil around us could well
 pierced. Another way us get benefit might us individually
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 186 261
 
 submit projections staff. staff circulates us review,
 would projections aggregated extent see granularity
 listed numbers 1 19. Obviously, done lot ways.
 concerned that, go individual projections, would
 calls speculation would make us hunker somehow explain
 somewhat less interested hearing colleagues
 modifying projections time. would favor even step back
 anonymity—but enough, obviously, give us view colleagues are.
 Third, question requires probably time among issues
 raised third year versus three-to-five-year average. could change
 views this, instinct that, adopt three-to-five-year window
 set data, might look little cute. would prefer
 best say, “This projections.” get third year, crystal balls
 cloudier shorter periods. time, third
 year, ways speeches, could elaborating third
 year means us. us might aspirational. us might
 opportunistic. would hesitate go point. But, again,
 think right path forward, obviously discussion continue. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser intervention.
 MR. PLOSSER. Yes. want make one comment issue fed
 funds path. Vice Chairman Geithner Governor Warsh made comment
 markets. hear talk markets, struck narrow
 definition markets care about. looking context
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 187 261
 
 financial markets care funds rate is—what path going be.
 think much narrow way think trying here.
 say don’t care inflation care funds rate
 slippery slope. Whether financial adviser worried inflation
 planning clients people investing long term trying make
 decisions housing things, think go back inflation.
 markets think fed funds rate going be. regard—I going
 go limb bit here—to extent longer-term decisions prices
 longer-term assets, longer-term bonds, move frequently short-run funds rate
 decisions—sometimes more, sometimes less—that really tells us something
 expecting path future. trying infer something
 future path one decision. extent provide certainty
 shape path relates inflation objectives inflation ranges
 want talk about, going change dynamic short long rates
 way remove uncertainty speculation
 path going be, even though time convey uncertainty
 individual perspectives that. think want careful
 become focused tomorrow’s market response care
 think goes beyond that. wanted share group.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. could add that. similar reaction Vice
 Chairman Geithner. targeted money supply growth, markets reacted money
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 188 261
 
 supply growth figures thought going react money supply
 growth. Red Sox victories influence fed funds rate setting, market would react
 Red Sox. Obviously, going manipulate fed funds rate response
 inflation. don’t think going drop table anytime soon. sort
 sounds great say don’t care inflation, care fed funds
 rate. Well, going care inflation care fed funds rate.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Perhaps could say piece again,
 didn’t misinterpret it. course care inflation, course care
 whether going competently deliver acceptable inflation outcomes time.
 point say even gave clarity objective certain
 horizon, quantitative terms, fundamentally would still want know
 going achieve that, still going leave unmet principal demand.
 course care inflation, care inflation. believe
 differences concerned today—a central tendency 50 basis point
 spread it—are small compared uncertainty would like us resolve
 going react stuff. really want something don’t
 think fundamentally give them. really want certainty
 given time going react changing world, would like
 us resolve mystery future hold evolution economy.
 important recognize that. right, course care inflation
 we’re going react inflation.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 189 261
 
 MS. MINEHAN. would like add comment favor uncertainty
 markets. Uncertainty important markets work. Uncertainty critical
 market participants forming views future managing risks
 see future. Everybody talks famous Greenspan put. know
 Greenspan going save us market overdoes it, let’s play
 rising market Fed save us everything tanks. overdone
 argument, heard made. give people policy path, matter
 characterize it, going take far given could ever really
 commit to, going make bets basis. bets don’t work
 out, going another version Fed leading garden path.
 really think go there. encourage uncertainty markets
 actual policy path going be, given three-year period
 three-to-five-year period range Committee’s preferences around inflation
 within narrow band. Let markets figure think incoming data
 prescribe terms policy make bets basis. think certain degree
 uncertainty absolutely healthy markets.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. thank Vice Chairman Geithner clarifying views.
 couldn’t agree vast range uncertainty
 can’t help markets can’t help us. would like know
 future. imperative, least, focus resolving
 uncertainty resolve. Foremost list would coming terms

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Well, I, too, strongly favor direction
 proposed, Mr. Chairman, reasons laid moving direction.
 would urge us move promptly practical path. fairly flexible
 many specifics would accompany path think
 one way skin cat think important get there.
 get specifics, let say went back looked
 fairly recent chronology changes communication going back 1994.
 don’t know whether got everything; actions equally significant;
 course, don’t counterfactuals, don’t know would happened
 taken steps. think fair say increases
 communication, beginning press releases back 1994 expediting
 minutes forth, benefit hindsight worked well.
 worked well part give things pretty careful consideration
 long deliberation move ahead. think done case
 well, well positioned move ahead this.
 far specifics go, yes, would favor quarterly
 frequency. would favor sticking three-year horizon.
 particularly opposed longer one, least date think three-year horizon
 would significant advance. seems worked reasonably well far
 trial runs concerned, would that. terms general shape latest
 trial run, level anonymity, forth, fine me, wouldn’t see
 need make particular changes regard that. regard form
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 191 261
 
 projections released, think would come favor
 President Moskow’s suggestion sort appendix minutes. think
 give us flexibility time big problem make sure
 whatever say minutes consistent projections. think
 manageable issue, would favor that. would also favor cutting projections
 soon possible meeting couple reasons. One raises
 potential confusion know know it,
 avoid.
 also think don’t really want put much emphasis high-frequency
 data. get one two observations, time don’t
 make much difference; even seem indicate significant departure
 expected, subject revision next observation get day
 two later may work opposite direction. doesn’t seem lot
 advantage emphasizing them.
 would favor expediting minutes, think would defer
 now, talking major steps. ought get place
 first, come back think expediting minutes shortly thereafter,
 assuming works well, that’s want do. probably
 good reasons end day, don’t view quite important
 things we’re talking point. that, that’s want
 say. think process making significant progress here,
 encouraged that.

 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, applaud putting
 concrete proposal table. Committee nineteen, many moving parts
 could have, could end camel wanted horse, therefore
 something concrete react helpful.
 said that, looked question strategic level
 tactical level. Let comment strategic level first. way process
 question based principles respect, principle-based
 objectives (1) transparency governance best principle general,

 say, grounding results optimal outcome involve

 preference CPI, slight—I don’t even think it’s second order issue,
 maybe third order; it’s really critical. advantage CPI better known. Vice
 Chairman Geithner mentioned actually involved lot contracts. One reason
 CPI used revised. turns reason lean

 want thoughts statement. Let propose
 following. Let’s take half-hour break lunch. come back—I’ve
 conferred Governor Kohn this—let ask answer two questions.
 One, light proposed changes, happy statement,
 change would make? Two, happy approval governance—the
 process construct statement? answer could yes-yes, no-no,
 [laughter]—clearly 3:00 p.m. drop-dead deadline—but hope
 quick efficient go-round two questions. let’s take break lunch
 come back half hour.
 [Lunch break]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let us reconvene. Again, thank
 useful discussion lunch. Let remind need keep discussion
 within room. would destructive whole process leak
 next months. appreciate that.
 last item business go-round statement. Remember
 two questions. First, given seem going using projections
 elements discussed, think statement okay? suggestions
 changing it? Second, comments consultative
 governance issues? would like begin? President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. far statement goes, way would phrase
 live have. may anticipate President Minehan little bit, would
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 202 261
 
 like see simpler shorter go forward, especially move minutes
 closer meeting date discussed earlier. would enable us that.
 That’s first comment. governance, think way right fine.
 going statement structured, process seems working,
 don’t see need, again, vote it.
 MR. KOHN. Could add governance question issue vote
 Committee? vote whole statement first fourth sections
 now?
 MR. HOENIG. Well, guess way would answer would change
 way I’m sure it’s first fourth section. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. practical implication really wouldn’t
 legitimate agree dissent description economy inflation.
 MR. HOENIG. That’s right.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. agree that—but hear people
 say. Thank you. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you. I’m basically happy statement now. It’s
 exactly thought would come out, honestly. look it, it’s really
 pretty straightforward needs do—by mean provides
 concise, would say valuable, rationale decision. include,
 does, something that’s forward looking bit obviously lags policy we’re
 making decisions based looking rearview mirror. don’t think it’s
 long. It’s only, counted right, seven sentences something like that.
 doesn’t strike excessively long. fact, things equal, would probably
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 203 261
 
 favor adding rather reducing it, don’t think it’s worth effort based
 experience around table recent years. [Laughter] think
 reasonably effectively. inspirations, guess, improve
 significant way. think continue evolve economy, outlook
 economy, position policy do. That’s inevitable.
 far governance concerned, would prefer voting entire statement,
 don’t think current system badly broken absolutely, positively need
 something it. seems though spend fair amount time it,
 don’t know wouldn’t end day vote it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you. think statement okay. little concerned
 modify case case. Today issue “elevated” “somewhat
 elevated” would change without giving message don’t intend.
 don’t know whether craft language would avoid sort case-by-case issue.
 seems go projections exercise, might want come
 back that. governance, could go either way. think it’s okay way works
 fully discuss issue. there’s sentiment vote full thing, that’s fine,
 too.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you. I’m basically happy statement way
 now. Like President Stern, leaning side making shorter, started
 look would cut, hard come places cut. don’t think
 adopting changes outlined earlier shorten statement.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 204 261
 
 could change characterize elements statement, especially rationale
 section. talk economic growth, characterize relates
 central tendency projections we’ve provided. characterize inflation,
 rather using words like “remains elevated” “will moderate further,” public
 benefit projections quarterly basis, might easier
 describe view inflation situation. also adopting total measure
 inflation, easier and, again, clearer we’re saying words like “inflation”
 “inflationary pressures.” public better understand measure we’re looking at.
 don’t think new approach revised approach would change length,
 might help us communication process, I’m happy way we’re
 risk assessment statement now.
 terms governance, think public views statement product
 Committee deliberations, reason think Committee vote
 full statement would helpful. regard, Vice Chairman Geithner made comment
 earlier go approach, let’s make fewer changes table focus
 giving input statement meeting. editing
 table, don’t time reflect changes interpreted.
 fewer changes table would helpful. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. like statement is. one who,
 considered accelerating release minutes, thought would take weight
 crafting statement, could shorten. Alas, incorrect, sort
 hopeless. I’m giving up. sort like length statement now.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 205 261
 
 reasonable job does, one exception—the last section, so-called
 balance-of-risk assessment. I’ve argued many times we’ve talked this.
 intention convey likely next direction interest rate changes. general practice
 been—there exceptions—to describe risks things care
 about, invite people deduce think likely next direction
 interest rate moves inverting policy reaction function somehow. always thought
 problematic, needlessly obscure, liked times crafted
 statement fairly directly explicitly phrases like “policy firming.”
 balance-of-risk assessments, hesitate put something else table,
 ought think directive, too, balance-of-risk assessment came
 statement directive tilt statement
 directive originated ’80s way providing Committee’s sense
 constraint Chairman’s discretion make intermeeting moves. That’s
 understanding arose. came next meeting
 intermeeting moves, it’s sitting directive, don’t know
 good directive really. know, don’t make intermeeting moves. don’t
 know understanding discretion intermeeting moves. think
 we’re supposed conference call everybody. don’t know need
 little directive there, seems could take directive.
 governance, I’m favor voting whole thing. remember talking
 one point think you, Mr. Chairman, others backward us
 talk statement—to negotiations statement—a week even
 talk read Greenbook. don’t think that’s problematic. doesn’t
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 206 261
 
 end putting feet cement really, think we’ve able sufficient
 flexibility meeting despite said week before. don’t view
 terribly problematic.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Regarding first question, statement, think process
 working well point, don’t see need major changes it. Given
 consensus moving forward projections, think fits quite well
 existing process statement. feeling minimize forward-looking
 comments statement. never used this, got phrases
 like “considerable period,” “patience,” forth, evolved statement
 say “future policy adjustments depend evolution outlook
 inflation” forth, data coming in. don’t really forward-looking
 statement currently, preference use forward-looking statements
 really important serve specific purpose Committee. tend agree Jeff
 Lacker could drop last part statement.
 governance issue, seems artificial vote entire statement
 spend much time talking parts it. balance would say, yes,
 vote entire statement. One issue raised background material
 whether statement Chairman’s Committee’s. think
 Committee’s. would put Chairman awkward position
 statement Committee. wasn’t statement Committee, people would try
 pull us apart asking us questions individually whether agree “the
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 207 261
 
 Chairman’s statement.” think process right
 Committee statement.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. clarify comment forward-looking
 language, examples policy, like “considerable period” whatever,
 necessarily. comment apply statements like “output going grow
 moderate pace?”
 MR. MOSKOW. No, clarified that. No, terms comments
 statement outlook economy, yes, think that’s fine. thinking
 outlook policy.
 MR. KOHN. also two-hander that. terms things like
 “predominant concern,” kind forward looking concern
 future, would would cut whole fourth section?
 MR. MOSKOW. No, appropriate, would keep that. thinking
 primarily last sentence happen there. recollection evolved
 “a considerable period” “patience” forth, got “it depend
 outlook inflation economic growth.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. I’m sure heard clearly, Mike, want clarify:
 advocating eliminating risk assessment directive, would keep section
 statement.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. think statement
 right. like current length structure. would want see great deal detail
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 208 261
 
 assessment economy. think wait minutes,
 don’t think there’s anything that’s statement cut. statement
 evolved; practice avoided something formulaic terms
 balance risks. language time. sometimes use
 forward-looking policy language sometimes don’t. That’s good. think
 avoid anything formulaic what’s appropriate given conditions.
 path raising fed funds rate 1 percent, every expectation
 would involved series steps time, would highly artificial
 avoid indicating statement expectation. important signal
 using forward-looking language. wouldn’t want take forward-looking language
 table. doesn’t seem important expectation flat path.
 think statement working well. I’m really amazed well process drafting
 statement working too.
 MR. MISHKIN. Well, considering group. [Laughter]
 MS. YELLEN. Initially started getting circulating ideas
 meeting, thought, “Oh, going chaotic spin control.” I’ve
 amazed thoroughly constructive been—that time walk
 statement, actually evolved fair amount. think always
 improvement, able drafting sessions, worked
 surprisingly well.
 governance, think thing accidentally fallen governance hole,
 needs cleaned up. Committee vote whole statement. That’s
 outside world thinks now; haven’t noticed don’t.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 209 261
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank much. I’m relatively happy statement.
 Along lines Presidents Yellen Moskow discussed, would try stay away
 much possible forward-looking language commitments. There’s time
 place—2003 going forward: Moving 1 percent unique occurrence, think.
 would really focus statement, mostly now,
 it. forward-looking component it. depend
 expect economy look like future expect inflation go.
 Something referencing things there. druthers, I’d
 agnostic whether assessment risk every time; rather,
 consider adds possibly subtracts terms statement.
 wouldn’t committed section 4 every time. It’s really good,
 extent it, stay away formulaic language focus statement
 much realities time it.
 terms process, anything edited nineteen people, process
 always optimal. Getting little sense staff week helpful.
 allowed people, included, time time weigh in, actually heard
 meeting make changes draft statement look meeting.
 understand desire much editing around table. However, thought
 one reasons went two-day meetings could get
 read others saying thinking one day, think
 implications said said overnight, bring
 thoughts table next day. always thought lot logic
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 210 261
 
 process probably adds rather subtracts amount comments
 around table, particularly find bit tenuous dicey
 situation regard characterize people feeling things. think
 I’d willing bear little noise around table rather little less.
 governance issues, think started Chairman’s statement
 nobody stomach nineteen people editing. better let
 Chairman’s statement, therefore didn’t right edit it. Now, course,
 edit it, doesn’t seem reasonable vote entire statement. think it’s
 easy enough make change. whole thing esoteric anyway can’t
 imagine anybody aside us knows don’t vote even focused
 it. idea people going dissent statement? We’re dissenting
 policy. find difficult think dissenting statement going big issue,
 always possible, suppose. governance issues? think
 probably said this. current approval process difficult; given ability look
 form draft week before, able think overnight, provide
 substance editing process next day, think works okay.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, think statement statement
 Committee. don’t problem current governance structure, although
 think make sense everybody vote since hammer anyway.
 wouldn’t change language. one sentence always repeat,
 given—that future policy actions depend evolution outlook, et
 cetera, et cetera. guess say every time, I’m sure say
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 211 261
 
 every time. It’s given. Otherwise, I’d keep same, although promise continue
 lobby word “global” infinity. [Laughter] Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like others, think statement
 basically evolved good place. sometimes worry process putting
 statement together nineteen people mean there’s much inertia process.
 far, maybe economy hasn’t jerked around much recently, we’ve
 able keep up. think need make sure language doesn’t lag
 events or, events start move, we’ve got willing change language even
 though it’s hard here. like way balance-of-risk section evolved talking
 what’s going happen funds rate—I agree President Yellen
 appropriate particular circumstances—to talking right-hand side
 Taylor rule—that is, what’s going happen output inflation gaps. think that’s
 positive. gives little vague guidance Committee worried
 about, think that’s probably helpful markets. elaborated
 minutes, fills three-week gap minutes come out. Certainly changed
 minds saw risks economy, would probably want tell
 people minutes come out. basically you’re pretty good place
 here, continue evolve. allow continue evolve.
 governance side, think editing also going pretty well. got
 pre-meeting editing, little concerned decisions going move
 outside room. process evolved way get close final
 statement pre-meeting sessions, fine-tune language
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 212 261
 
 meeting. That’s probably need we’re going put statement. I’m
 comfortable there. think people outside room think
 Committee responsible whole statement, probably ought
 acknowledge making Committee responsible whole statement.
 that, ought understand among hurdle dissenting words
 very, high else get governance mess.
 thoughts.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. like statement format process
 and, like Governor Kohn, think governance, urgent change,
 catch reality expectation. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thanks. Much Gary Stern said, academic
 never particularly enamored statement. actually seen evolves,
 built—usually see way sausage made, upsets stomach,
 actually opposite. [Laughter] Maybe eating sausage
 long now. don’t know. [Laughter] I’ve taken it. think, Governor
 Kohn said, evolved way many elements critical
 years ago now. think operates perfectly reasonable way.
 people mentioned statement could change speed
 minutes. We’re never going speed minutes beyond say week. Even
 get week, don’t think feasible, statement can’t change much.
 convey information that’s statement. don’t think say, “Well,
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 213 261
 
 gee, next week we’re going say something, cut two
 sentences three sentences.” long there’s week between, can’t imagine
 less week between, statement going kind
 information it, think evolved perfectly reasonable way.
 governance, since process working, don’t really see need change it.
 There’s possibility line concurring opinions could put
 people agree whatever monetary policy movement but, like Supreme Court,
 write statement. Since process seems working well without leaving
 possibility coming in, don’t see it’s necessary make change, although I’m
 open that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. terms issue forward-looking language, I’m quite
 comfortable statement forward-looking language long it’s
 right-hand side Taylor rule terms what’s going output inflation. I’m
 actually fan forward-looking language terms federal funds rate, fact,
 differ people this. really didn’t like it, even unusual period
 concern deflation—in context, elements
 people might interpreted commitment. turned nothing bad happened
 economy evolved reasonable way, think scenarios
 period, particularly 2004 forth, might real problem.
 statement end we’re always contingent events. like statement;
 don’t want see moving period, except
 unusual circumstances. beginning justifiable terms concerns
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 214 261
 
 deflation, actually real potential problems arise, think got
 lucky. I’m comfortable right now. think editing process
 going well terms meeting—there fine-tuning going on, it’s done
 constructive way, think it’s working well.
 terms governance, guess lean toward idea vote it,
 following reason. think policy, it’s today
 that’s important. signaling future every bit important.
 whole issue Chairman worked Mike Woodford on—the issue
 managing expectations federal funds rate now; it’s also
 path. fact, projections talking much consistent
 way thinking. reality that, policy viewpoint, say
 statement important voting federal funds rate. Indeed, since
 I’ve Board, that’s really issue really haven’t much
 debate federal funds rate decision. sense, really important
 key part policy, makes sense us vote it. I’m worried issue
 dissents point made, Governor Kohn, high
 barrier exactly way people proceeding. barrier fairly high
 federal funds rate decision, case even so. It’s couple words,
 dissent, well, honest, you’re jerk. [Laughter] don’t see jerks here.
 feeling don’t think we’re going big problem.
 MR. STERN. anymore. [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. I’m actually quite comfortable moving direction.
 Thank much.
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 215 261
 
 MR. KOHN. put words minutes get
 sooner five years. [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. I’ll outlier terms transcripts five years now;
 they’ll say, “Oh, God, Rick here.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. may horrify everyone table
 joined Committee, didn’t actually parse statement every weeks.
 [Laughter] don’t lot historical perspective, I’m basically okay way
 process works now. think inclusions statement serve purpose. I’m
 sure fully understand right left side Taylor rule, Rick, maybe
 afterward explain me. view statement short term.
 forward-looking statements, short term. signal next meeting two,
 much that. Regarding governance voting issues, think
 vote whole thing, ever need tie breaker, guess would
 revert time Chairman’s statement. normal circumstances,
 vote agree, that’s it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, relatively new
 process watching sausage made. confess front I’m bit
 schizophrenic I’m really two minds terms direction think
 about, I’m persuadable either way. Part me, Jeff said, argued maybe
 forecasting exercise going take pressure nuances time spend
 statement. Governor Kroszner mentioned, matter soon get minutes
 
 June 27-28, 2007
 
 216 261
 
 out, it’s going tough that. I’m sympathetic argument. view
 minutes really provide nuance goes Committee, think that’s
 incredibly important. thing worry terms statement can’t
 provide nuance gets much attention marketplace immediately
 part says either want enrich statement get rid inertia
 that’s it, make longer make shorter. part says maybe
 really ought say statement section 1 section 4 let nuance
 got views elaborated minutes. part says
 would simplification tells markets view
 assessment risk look economy, doesn’t try tell details
 went on. let minutes that. live statement way is,
 think might advantages simplifying don’t spend much
 time arguing nuances rationales things. Besides that, we’d get
 capacity utilization possible go overall assessment
 risk, let minutes speak terms nuances discussion.
 governance question, agree everybody else. think
 implicitly statement Committee. Committee ought vote it. took
 sections 2 3 out, would lot less wordsmithing lot less worrying
 whether words exactly right us might meant preferred
 say. might even make easier Committee vote that, they’d
 worry fewer things. thoughts.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think statement
