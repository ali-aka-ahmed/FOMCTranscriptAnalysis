 MR. EVANS. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Dave, want lump together various forms financial distress
 here—the mortgage market, auto loans, credit card loans, maybe even business failures.
 memory serves correctly (and may well not), look history business cycle

 business cycle peak right now, appears great deal financial distress ahead of—

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Dave, I’m difficulty reconciling employment hours data

 MR. STOCKTON. forecast, fact, square labor market forecast

 MR. SHEETS. Yes, echo Dave said, little hard data far,

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions? President Evans.
 MR. EVANS. looking alternative simulations credit crunch scenario

 that’s are. also scenarios slightly stronger,

 MR. STOCKTON. Well, think, showed alternative scenarios, something like
 either credit crunch greater housing correction scenarios—in real world obviously
 wouldn’t necessarily shocks would independent other—but either one
 two scenarios constructed produce something looks similar markets might
 thinking. don’t think scenarios unreasonable.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. David, listening this, question. looking
 projecting forward, we’re talking fed funds rate path comes down, yet we’ve talked
 great deal inflation rising temporarily views. question is, give
 pause? analyze risk lowering rates environment rising
 inflation global basis? concerns risk? reevaluating risk
 stable inflationary expectations might scenario?

 MR. STOCKTON. Obviously baseline forecast don’t really pickup
 inflation, even headline inflation, beyond near term. think that, next

 reflecting jump energy prices lingering increases food prices.
 MR. HOENIG. Right, you’re saying slowdown economy makes

 MR. STOCKTON. slowdown economy helps sense think

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Rosengren.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think took pessimism pill
 President Yellen morning. Greenbook makes somber reading, would
 make several observations forecast provides. First, Greenbook forecasts two

 Third, would note unemployment rate rises least ½ percent, tends rise

 that, recession forecast Greenbook—as David careful state—the

 last meeting, housing market soft, weakness components

 Consumer lending probably area I’ve seen greatest change,
 raised concerns most. I’ll hold mortgages moment. First, talked
 large provider credit cards consumer products, HELOCs, mortgages, et cetera,
 said that, since report received last FOMC meeting, things
 reasonably stable, seen significant deterioration. people said, even though
 gone sharply, numbers still reasonable, it’s delta concerns me,
 sharp deterioration they’re seeing. They’re seeing nationwide. sharpest deterioration
 is, number people said, areas seen greatest housing-price stress—
 California, Nevada, Florida—but it’s limited those. won’t go details
 told delinquency rates different types products, nationwide
 seeing doubling, tripling, quadrupling areas, period six eight

 Also, one phrases use they’re seeing “contagion book.”

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, Governor. Well, again, thank
 helpful discussion. Let try briefly summarize offer additional comments.
 Many participants obviously gave considerable attention resurgence stresses financial
 markets, including increased losses financial institutions, widening spreads, poorly
 functioning markets. expressed concern developments likely result
 tighter credit—not mortgages, conditions already tight, areas well—
 perhaps resulting spillovers broader economy. weakening economy could cause
 financial conditions worsen further, leading negative feedback loop, indeed,
 signs broader credit deterioration. Impending mortgage rate resets foreclosures pose
 risks. took developments increasing downside risk growth, perhaps
 significantly. However, participants noted mitigating factors, including fact
 banks came situation lot capital. institutions raised capital. There’s
 possibility credit providers could take money center banks. Corporate
 balance sheets strong. credit problems regional focus cases,
 lack effect far many Main Street. also noted price discovery process
 inevitable needed.
 respect macroeconomic data, overall incoming data slightly weaker
 expected, particularly housing consumption, although, again, anecdotes
 somewhat mixed. Fundamentals consumption weaker collapsing, labor

 Let add bit discussion because, usual, already thorough.
 Again, one looks incoming macro data, think fair judgment little weaker
 expected. economy little slower expected. Housing data,
 consumption, would argue investment production numbers somewhat lower
 thought going case end October. would also argue that, particular,
 consumer, course crucial expansion, facing somewhat weaker conditions—
 including higher oil prices, less wealth lower stock house prices, perhaps tighter

 forecasts among consumers even weaker would suggested

 Now, certainly positive developments data. labor market
 held pretty well. unemployment rate actually dropped bit last week. Stocks come
 back bit so-called correction, although say conditional lot
 expected easing Federal Reserve. ISM surveys show manufacturing flat,
 manufacturing still growing, bit good news yesterday housing,
 slight indications improved pending sales. think it’s interesting Michigan survey notes
 prospective homebuyers actually bit upbeat see interest rates low

 unmixed.
 would interpret this? think could take sanguine view

 certainly true. It’s also still true lot weakness we’re seeing housing sector.
 example, ’07, growth excluding housing 3½ percent—so again, suggestive
 great weakness. Now, noted, don’t think I’d go quite far Governor Mishkin;
 try maintain even keel mood. [Laughter]

 we’re seeing continued losses, expect see go forward. second element
 pressure balance sheets. Banks taking off-balance-sheet assets onto balance sheet.
 example Governor Kroszner mentioned leveraged-loan market, open
 seems closed, securitization markets remain closed.
 Moreover, think particularly worrisome going forward, supervisors—and
 all, course, talk supervisors—are increasingly concerned credit quality looks
 likely evolve. Commercial real estate one area we’ve seen essentially defaults yet,
 things tend lag, there’s lot expectation among bankers among
 supervisors sector weakening. One indicator banks’ views raising

 regional community banks, face problems: lack securitization

 think we’re going see tightening credit could get worse.
 Experience suggests that, financial conditions always different financial structure

 likely see risk assessment signaling likelihood imminent policy

 straightforward, partly Committee’s practices evolved time;
 President Evans noted, since 1999 Committee released
 risk assessment form tilt along announcement. Despite
 qualifications, basic answer seems be, surprisingly, risk
 assessments predictive future Committee action. experience
 December 2000 January 2002 makes point clearly. period,
 fourteen meetings row Committee indicated “the risks weighted
 mainly toward conditions may generate economic weakness foreseeable
 future.” eleven fourteen instances, indication followed
 policy easing next meeting. Later, toward end 2002, one two
 indications downside risk followed easing, June 2003, different

 all, seems reasonable judge current circumstances maintaining

 alternative C, would lead market participants continue put high odds future
 policy easing. absence policy action meeting despite nearly
 unanimous expectations policy easing would mean expectation
 downtilt rates would begin notably higher level might less steep,
