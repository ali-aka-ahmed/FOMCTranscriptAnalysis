 market distress? Second, cause dysfunction U.S. European

 words, might anticipate resumption normal market function?
 Turning first question, losses subprime mortgages wide-ranging
 effects poor investment performance made investors much less willing
 invest structured-finance products generally. Investors lost confidence

 investors found difficult value complex structured-finance products.
 loss confidence triggered several broader developments: inability

 Finally, open market operations since last FOMC meeting warrant

 efforts push federal funds rate back toward target
 undermined several factors. First, expectations possibility

 foreign exchange operations period. request vote
 ratify operations conducted System Open Market Account since
 August 7 FOMC meeting. course, happy take questions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions Bill? President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. appreciate comments last point, think fact
 fed funds rate trading low long problematic. Certainly around August 9,
 started interventions, that’s understandable. Committee made clear
 time wasn’t changing targeted funds rate, yet past month
 essentially below. mind raised three questions. One technical question
 ability actually target fed funds rate using procedures place.
 continue quote price target try control using quantities. still believe would lot
 easier set price target buy sell. That’s operational question think
 table another day. also raised question watched going Desk
 choose intervene frequently day aggressive saw
 forecast day’s balances accurate. nothing says can’t go
 back day help rectify that, I’d like explanation
 didn’t whether that’s option. third question actually serious one
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 9 188
 
 combines technical issue philosophical one. think allowing fed funds rate trade
 low long away target really creates credibility problem Committee. puts
 us awkward position because, effect, hasn’t gone unnoticed investment
 community. called “stealth” rate cut already effect. said
 Fed already cut fed funds rate, puts Committee’s decision today somewhat
 awkward position people look back say, “Well, already done it.” think
 important think mechanisms ways ensure—at least going forward—that,
 Committee target, successful achieving it. I’d like
 enlightenment there, could.
 MR. DUDLEY. Turning first first question, way do—well,
 new authority pay interest reserves, going take pretty broad look
 whole issue target federal funds rate manage reserves generally.
 think that’s legitimate question, going done part process. Obviously,
 way today based sort historical evolution started Fed
 reveal federal funds rate target was. think it’s probably fair say four five
 years now, new authority, may things quite differently.
 terms issue going back later day, problem don’t
 really know what’s happening autonomous factors next morning. don’t know
 exactly we’re terms tracking reserve provisions relative forecast real
 time. don’t that.
 MR. PLOSSER. see rate.
 MR. DUDLEY. see rate. could aggressive push people
 window, think important environment contributing market turmoil.

 felt right thing err side pushing people forcibly window
 market distress. would also say fed funds rate,
 traded soft, hasn’t traded soft. effective rate far month 5.08, think
 that, coming meeting, pretty much eliminated minds people
 markets stealth easing, especially light federal funds rate
 trading past week. don’t see significant issue meeting.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bill, want make sure understand
 said excellent presentation. think heard say that, time passes, investors
 markets become discriminating. Already we’re seeing signs returning stability.
 I’m trying differentiate earlier—serious counterparty risk phobias—
 now—which seems concerns balance sheet risk. want understand
 better distinction two. read Egon’s briefing last night, way very,
 solid. read largest banks well positioned absorb even larger
 exposures currently anticipate, number document $1 trillion—a
 significant number five banks absorb. Given presented us—I think
 interpreted correctly—the concern counterparty risk diminishing, still there.
 balance sheet risk issue somewhat defined, although uncertainties—you mentioned
 yourself. There’s headline risk, cuts two ways, way, want talk
 intervention. also surprise loss might occur. Could distinguish
 us whether we’ve seen reduction counterparty risk, so, could define
 somewhat? serious balance sheet risk perspective background
 briefing received last night, indicated appears manageable?
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 11 188
 
 MR. DUDLEY. Well, it’s difficult sort exactly much term premium
 see term funding markets represents counterparty risk versus balance sheet constraints.
 think United States probably balance sheet issue. Europe it’s probably
 counterparty risk. general sense U.S. banks healthy and, note,
 well capitalized. However, fact still quite bit room hit
 boundary “well capitalized” doesn’t mean banks aren’t concerned potential balance
 sheet pressures. problem right can’t really size accuracy
 much coming onto balance sheets next months asset-backed
 commercial paper, bank conduits, things may
 hook didn’t expect hook for. wouldn’t take boundary line “well
 capitalized” versus “not well capitalized” constraint. think constraint actually starts
 bind quite bit get point.
 MR. FISHER. talked conduit question somewhat calls. Again,
 assume we’ve done sensitivity analysis degree terms potential
 absorb risk bring onto balance sheet. correct?
 MR. DUDLEY. analysis done suggested banks well
 capitalized should, one two exceptions, able handle balance sheet expansion
 reasonably well; can’t say absolute certainty.
 MR. FISHER. course, course.
 MR. DUDLEY. Another thing happening potential problem

 September 18, 2007

 also what’s happening terms capital. think uncertainty probably turn
 problem actual reality, it’s going take time us find
 actual reality is.
 MR. FISHER. May ask one question, Mr. Chairman? last meeting asked
 commercial paper risk Europe got nods great risk. anything
 see think don’t know hasn’t presentation would
 indicate significant potential risk?
 MR. DUDLEY. would hesitate say know great clarity there’s
 nothing else Europe. think bit surprised size
 conduits European banks sponsoring relative capital. would
 hesitant say transparency regarding marketplace know certainty
 there’s nothing else there.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. would like return issues President Plosser raised, think
 serious Committee. Maybe question would done differently
 benefit hindsight come closer target. “back envelope”
 calculation starting August 9 August 10 maybe fed funds rate averaged
 5 percent—so full ¼ percentage point target. felt constrained enter market
 later day concerns adding turmoil, certainly could consulted
 Committee tradeoff there. seem that, establish
 target, obligation achieve target. Obviously, early period erring side
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 13 188
 
 generosity problem, seemed gave away degrees freedom,
 shall say, way things proceeded. find considerable concern.
 MR. DUDLEY. would reemphasize fact try stingy. ex
 ante provision reserves less thought market needed, thought
 would push federal funds rate. control factors affect
 demand reserves, unfortunately consistently came side adding
 reserves system intended. said, pretty consistently trying
 push back market get effective federal funds rate back toward target, think
 say made meeting. think people market today
 believe there’s stealth easing market.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. reinforce Bill said—of course, spent lot
 time thinking exactly risks worried context, we’ll
 lot reflect terms nature regime legislative authority gives us
 going forward. think Bill people really simple choice, was—
 particularly point late August early September—whether acted

 look experience central banks managing situation past six weeks
 happened prematurely acted way ended rates

 confident guys erred right direction. also don’t believe, reinforce Bill

 regarding fed funds traded signaling effect constraining flexibility
 Committee. true bunch people mid-August talking
 possibility wondering whether read soft trading fed funds

 market relatively quickly.
 Again, think you’re raising absolutely right questions. grapple
 questions every day. basically made judgment adopt much aggressive stance
 stingy reserves various points period would created much risk
 fed funds trading firm relative target moment psychology confidence very,
 fragile. really think experience central banks good counter example

 Another thing would say coming later day it’s important

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. One complexity whole period

 MR. FISHER. still love Bill, way.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Oh, love Bill. [Laughter]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. want ask term funding market, want help us

 MR. DUDLEY. question volume, there’s question volume went

 Since term market mostly shut down, especially term fed funds, little

 past month compared normal. Now, terms actually borrowing term—well,
 people actually borrowing term. probably bit “lemons” problem
 term market sense that—because term rates elevated rates
 attractive economically—your wanting borrow term market sign
 probably good shape terms liquidity position. think contributed
 shutdown term market. economics really—why unless
 you’re bad shape really need funds? think contributed shrinking
 term market. Really two things going on. One, banks funds lend didn’t want
 lend term weren’t sure would need money road,
 depending going come onto balance sheets. Two, people wanted
 borrow term least attractive borrowers. caused market essentially dry
 period. think starting come back. We’re back normal obviously
 term rates still somewhat elevated relative overnight rate. it’s still attractive
 economic perspective, certainly attractive even week ago.
 MR. LACKER. could follow up, know Desk tracks overnight fed funds trades,
 get dealers quantities different rates order calculate effective rate.
 inferring term volume that, independent quantitative sources

 MR. DUDLEY. haven’t actually seen volume data term. may, fact, exist.
 did, though, look volume overnight federal funds market, saw

 Could something like account volume funds market?
 MR. DUDLEY. Yes, obviously moves direction, remember correctly,
 number volume fed funds market $400 billion $500 billion range.
 Twenty percent kind level quite bit bigger you’re seeing.
 MR. LACKER. Okay.
 MR. MADIGAN. would include brokered trades nonbrokered trades.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. But, Mr. Chairman, I’m mistaken, think
 term market interbank liquidity largely offshore Europe, fed funds onshore. I’m
 sure helps get context.
 MR. LACKER. Right. asking demand. curious know

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. research people tried figure whether
 could infer take Fedwire data indications who’s lending maturities
 who’s borrowing maturities balance is. sense looking this,
 maybe haven’t figured yet, doesn’t give kind clarity

 spend moments distinct phases financial market distress looked
 like try outline, maybe even oversimplify, that.
 Phase 1 strikes liquidity replenishment financial institutions marketmakers
 alike. past three four weeks, commercial banks, investment banks, asset managers,
 private pools capital reassess liquidity needs, cash needs,

 said liquidity confidence. Well, times like this, might wrong.
 Liquidity oxygen. can’t live without it, price compensate
 liquidity replenishment period lack oxygen. think O2 levels might finally
 returning, enter phase 2 process, able willing part
 cash. Phase 2, thus, finding new market-clearing valuations, able
 discriminate among differentiated assets, able put opportunistic capital work.
 Admittedly, I’d say valuation phase less advanced liquidity phase, process
 price discovery slowly surely working way asset classes. High-yield

 come.
 Let highlight issues. key challenges?
 things might want look see situation continues improve modestly

 additional reason us take monetary action today. Second, many still believe

 Third, leverage harder come by. Even investments credit work seems
 pretty easy, like high yield, hard get leverage alongside equity placements, making
 folks less interested jump back big way returns aren’t there. Another

 though seeing real improvements recent trading days, prospect

 answer was, “No, looks though things coming along okay.” think that’s reasonably
 encouraging. Second, asked credit quality consumer behavior, whether
 delinquencies individual credit card behavior low, medium, high end changed,
 answer really hadn’t changed much. look find yellow red
 flags, said generally consumer credit quality also looks fine. I’d say biggest
 caution three four credit card companies came corporate side.
 Corporations wanting protective, risk averse period, seemed
 cut back allowable expenses things like airlines, hotels, conferences, like,
 corporate credit volume slowed somewhat—but, again, nothing overly dramatic.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, thank all. Let briefly
 summarize make additional comments. Financial market conditions key theme
 discussion today. Recent developments financial markets reflected
 reduced willingness take risk tighter credit conditions. Bank balance sheets
 potential constraint credit extension. Participants unsure long
 conditions would persist, repricing risk seems likely persistent. tighter credit
 conditions likely weaken already weak housing market, nonprime borrowers
 rationed jumbo mortgage borrowers pay higher premiums. Mortgage rate resets
 foreclosures pose risks. Industries related housing naturally showing weakness.
 However, creditworthy borrowers able obtain credit. Second-quarter third-quarter
 GDP figures may solid, even signs slowing economy,
 even financial market developments, notably labor markets housing.
 Auto output also weak side. Labor markets remain tight, general Main Street
 far less affected thus far Wall Street. Consumer spending continues grow along
 incomes, net exports remain strong. Financing continue available
 capital investment. regional differences soundings business confidence

 whether weakness housing spread consumer spending; whether credit

 tightness affect sectors housing, including household sector commercial
 real estate; whether labor market continue slow. general view
 downside risks output increased bad scenarios least conceivable.
 However, others noted resilience U.S. economy fact previous financial
 crises necessarily reduced growth. Inflation moderated somewhat,
 participants view risk inflation closer balance. Inflation expectations remain stable,
 cyclical slowing likely reduce pressure resources. However, tight labor markets,
 strong foreign demand, high oil prices, pressures still exist.

 think that’s unwise message send. First, says policy reactive rather forward

 Now, let say couple things. First, one thing governance rules

 terms worrying markets opposed institutions, think potential perception

 picked smaller percentage auction one institution could take,
 broadening number institutions, think would perception
 designed markets rather institutions. Now, aware offset
 might take whole auction. less one institution take,
 greater risk you’re fully subscribed, presumably could change amount.
 I’d like hear least thought came 20 percent.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin question.

 140 188
 
 MR. MISHKIN. Actually, great minds think alike. first question asked
 exactly one going ask.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. two questions. degree new Lombard facility’s
 bidding process would avoid stigma issue unclear. Could repeat deals
 stigma issue? That’s first question, another one this.
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, partly auctioning credit, institutions coming
 Federal Reserve voluntarily paying price market based. Another point
 institutions regarded generally sound. meet certain qualification standard
 get discount window, would taking certain steps terms reports try
 distinguish discount window credit. Now, said, think admit
 we’re sure degree would deal stigma issue.
 MR. FISHER. mean, aren’t still saying distressed?
 MR. DUDLEY. No. No, economics better think
 minimum rate. minimum rate swap rate plus 10 basis points, well onemonth LIBOR well one-month term fed funds rate. room inbetween. could actually criticize bank participating this. somehow
 leaving money table taking advantage this.
 MR. FISHER. I’m sure small banks will. That’s mean. That’s they’re
 going like it. words, big institutional facility.
 MR. DUDLEY. necessarily.
 MR. MISHKIN. long need 50 million bucks.

 MR. FISHER. Well, $63 million, you’re using ratios you’re
 using, collateral. aspect. understand that’s meant address.
 second question derives first, is, could give us little
 background staff’s discussion tighter standards? gather
 discussion terms coming ACF well capitalized also well
 managed. distinction, state play argument opposed
 regular requirements going discount window?
 MR. ALVAREZ. consider imposing higher standard, something like “well
 capitalized well managed”—the financial holding company type standards—and two
 concerns raised. One problem President Rosengren referred
 rely exam rating capital adequacy determination another
 regulator. don’t get problem raising standards, institutions
 referred actually fit higher standard. didn’t achieve much.
 second thing concern might blackballing effect. folks

 might indicate Federal Reserve felt folks weaker. may fact
 people want get funding to. They’re ones seem struggling

 Fed wouldn’t even willing lend facility.

 you’re going unravel. sure want this? [Laughter]
 introducing this, think I’d inclined introduce good times, get

 much anything.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions take general comments?
 Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Quickly, follow-up that—if successful getting rid

 MR. DUDLEY. No.
 MR. KROSZNER. might pressure disappear certainly
 would desirable discount window. It’s cheaper, there’s stigma.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. don’t start go-round? President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve thinking lot since heard

 much agree staff weighing costs benefits reach assessment
 desirability inherently difficult judgment. critical question concerns
 normative implications we’re seeing marketplace term funding
 normative implications proposed intervention. Banks borrowing term
 paying insurance eventuality funding costs rise—for example,
 deterioration perceived creditworthiness. Banks viewed
 risk naturally willing pay insurance, reports suggest, Mr.
 Dudley morning, presence adverse-selection problem sense borrowing

 discussion morning. Balance sheet capacity appears genuinely scarce
 valuable commodity days. That’s consistent notion raising bank capital
 expensive current environment. think adverse-selection story worth considering
 seriously context it’s interpretation we’re seeing provides best
 hope intervention improves market functioning microeconomic sense
 term.
 adverse selection impaired functioning term market
 normative sense, must lower-risk banks unwilling borrow high

 current term-lending borrowers none rationed-out, lower-risk banks going get

 borrowers try reach credit, subsidizing high-risk borrowers
 well. Now, I’ll mention that, discussion morning, understanding
 little idea volume term lending is. don’t see chose number
 confident it’s going reach high-risk borrowers
 pick low-risk borrowers.
 broadly, I’m sure see facility could improve normative functioning
 market. We’re going auction contracts market participants

 something market participants incapable doing, would compelling borrowing

 want that. could conceivably improve market functioning acting information
 that’s superior market participants—a knowledge creditworthiness institutions,
 example. isn’t clear key part proposal either, institutions
 rated 3 get access think virtually currently affected institutions
 sorts high-risk low-risk categories 3 categories already. related point
 that, really think information constraints heart problem, might
 better address problem addressing constraints directly using supervisory
 authority encourage facilitate greater transparency. sense facility would
 subsidize borrowing banks without anything mitigate underlying informational
 asymmetries type market friction think of. means
 proposal raises usual moral hazard concerns. staff memo clear articulate
 those. think there’s danger facility raising expectations that, future,
 significant increases interbank funding spreads going ameliorated central bank
 intervention. raise expectation, we’re going undermine extent market
 mechanisms assessing relative risk institutions.
 I’m little worried produce demonstrable effect relevant market
 conditions, could erode confidence us, feel especially light previous change
 discount window policy, think widely viewed little substantive effect
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 146 188
 
 far. think that’s view there. also worry could complicate resolution failing
 institutions whose condition, Vice Chairman Geithner suggested, deteriorates they’re
 borrowing auction facility. would put us awkward place. Governor Kohn
 said, isn’t like one-day emergency kind thing—it takes time. institutions
 questionable situations, problem institutions, look term funding willing wait
 four days get know enough condition line ahead time. worry
 sounding like cloak ECB, us give money ECB, worry
 President Rosengren’s issues well, I’d comfortable swap line
 domestic facility. foreign authorities want extend credit knowledge
 capacity so, it’s dime they’re bearing credit risk want borrow
 dollars us, see reasonable step central bank take. also worry
 valuing collateral. don’t think mechanisms robust strong, especially
 current environment least standard haircuts.
 Now, appreciate broader problem articulated staff others banks
 constrained term funding market might tighten borrowing terms consumers
 businesses might real economic consequences. that’s problem, think
 would better us cut funds rate rather alter relative funding costs
 different banks. essentially today. cut funds rate offset
 macroeconomic effects higher credit spreads.
 final set comments. broadly, I’ve hoping time banking
 policy country moving slowly surely toward greater reliance market discipline
 away forbearance subsidization. I’ve hoping central bank would
 gradually move away things tainted credit allocation. Times like don’t

 make reputational progress time-consistency problem heart moral
 hazard. balance considerations weighs heavily proposal, Mr.
 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let echo first said congratulate staff
 enormous amount work terrific presentation. want say word, President
 Lacker. arguments premised idea markets basically kind
 equilibrium we’re messing equilibrium. There’s longstanding tradition,
 central banking theoretical analysis, periods insufficient cash
 market prices are, therefore, driven away fundamentals lack cash.
 central banks provide cash collateral. refer you, example, Franklin Allen
 Douglas Gale’s new book, Understanding Financial Crises, present model
 exactly property.
 moral hazard issue following: good reason allow deviation
 cash-based valuations fundamentals creates incentives providing sufficient
 liquidity rewards sufficient liquidity. beyond certain range, models
 well central banking experience suggest that, fire sale type situation,
 central bank useful providing cash collateral. Essentially process would
 take $140 billion undervalued, hard-to-sell, illiquid assets onto central bank’s balance sheet
 provide term liquid funding place, find totally consistent Bagehot
 traditions central bank lending. Now, question arises whether market sufficient

 distress. it’s not, we’re first regime deviation values
 fundamentals legitimate. market extreme distress, think—I repeat said
 before—there situations markets simply functioning well could

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Again, I’ll echo praise incredible work staffs
 done—a clever way address specific problems we’re facing. One stigma
 problem, two, mentioned earlier, source uncertainty. don’t really
 tool get directly; get indirectly. 1998 situation,
 another way get that. people thought good way; people thought
 bad way. won’t debate that, market perception particular institution
 heart lot uncertainty, could resolve that, could reduce uncertainty
 significantly. Also interventions IMF organizations dealt
 international uncertainties. traditional tools have, we’re somewhat hampered
 trying get that, think clever way try so. really comments
 echo President Rosengren said. start move overnight
 term funding, may need rethink kind collateral have. Obviously, we’re using
 80 percent collateral rather 100 percent collateral. That’s certainly step right
 direction.
 need think whether need “well capitalized well managed.” creates
 challenges trying differentiate overnight lending facility, Mr.
 Alvarez said, raises issues respect singling institutions make one hurdle
 don’t make hurdle. need think carefully potential
 challenge optics point view substantive point view that, short run,
 want help institutions certain ways providing funding don’t want
 helping taken appropriate actions.

 extreme circumstances like now, Chairman said, one could certainly
 say we’re equilibrium pricing lot assets, pricing collateral, pricing
 value, pricing issuances certain institutions, extremely important short

 carefully potential altered time don’t feel we’re sufficient
 haircuts. feel certain institutions may transit one rating another within twentyeight days, need prepared think respond raises questions

 may create longer-term issue expectation kind thing come
 another type clever innovation deal next market problem
 people don’t worry market problems. that’s difficult tradeoff
 make. support addressing short-term problem, think largely deal
 longer-term issues stick guns make temporary clearly
 articulate we’re trying get at.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. One appealing things broadens options, think
 that, time set circumstances find solutions, broadening
 options good. appreciate fact voting today think deserves
 little thought, especially unintended consequences. advantages
 saying temporary, I’m sure aren’t also disadvantages that.
 advantages trying remove stigma, I’m sure hazards create

 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, lot thought since realized
 weren’t going immediately addressed previous individuals
 spoken. I’d like touch points. First, like everyone else, want congratulate
 staff excellent work. creative. It’s also well balanced way pros
 cons argued. Bagehot Lombard facility withstanding, seems that,
 proceed path, position it’s refinement August
 rather confession failure insufficiency. would point number 1.
 Still, President Lacker made good points, part gets President
 Poole mentioned, political risk, addition risk failure,
 acknowledge may work. concerns value
 collateral automaticity, were, kind new facility ability value
 complicated collateral.
 biggest concerns ideas, President Lacker put it, we’re subsidizing foreign
 banks without really anything mitigate hazard. think roughly translates said,
 gets point President Poole’s comment. mindful risk
 perceived (1) helping limited number large money center banks (2) bailing
 Europeans. Now, understand that. don’t think public understands that. look

 I’m swap line, another point President Lacker made. Usually would
 expect President Lacker swap line, he’s swap line. I’m
 swap line. beg question whether couldn’t swap line work

 would present this, proceed, refinement.
 Mr. Chairman, would like time think this. I’m grateful you’re giving us
 time think it, I, again, would like consider governance aspects it.
 questions juncture. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Evans.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s creative proposal, agree
 basically comments President Rosengren Governor Kroszner said it. It’s
 important collateral appropriate well established, it’s definitely better don’t
 simply small number borrowers. It’s also important know hit funds rate

 that, it’s going even better opportunity everyone. think it, seems
 though opportunity narrow spread 10 basis points instead 50 basis points
 actually discount window, except eligibility requirements.
 support temporary facility, I’m glad we’re going time think
 it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. I, too, want congratulate staff creative proposal. think
 need time think this, let offer, degree, speculative remarks.
 They’re speculative years since I’ve even around treasury
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 156 188
 
 money center bank, think feel it. First, looking market
 perspective, lengthening maturity liabilities then, train, assets desirable. Clearly,
 assist financial stability, objective here. sub-objectives reduce stigma
 unstick market short-term orientation.
 try put shoes bank treasurer thinking whether use
 facility. way large bank treasuries work, least worked close
 them, essentially called MCO, maximum cumulative outflow,
 schedule, schedule liability maturities going 360 days more. Today’s picture
 margin—that say, money markets, noncore deposits, things basically
 banks funding margin—spikes early. It’s dramatically early,
 tails off, seems treasurer would think asking, “What MCO gain
 get using this?” matter days—maybe two three days, twenty-eight—
 you’re adding mix liabilities already have. offset would
 reaction market, stigma question, perceive bank using this—that is,
 whether would countervailing reaction. It’s probably insignificant matter
 hard try that, use lender last resort funding source, using lender
 last resort funding source. treasurer, would making kind calculation
 whether really gaining MCO point view significant comfort relative
 direction thought market going.
 hope issue improve dramatically second half October.
 week next week, believe, going go broker-dealer disclosures,
 mid-October, we’ll get large bank bank disclosures, market
 transparency improve, seems me, reasonably strongly period.
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 157 188
 
 conceivable we’ll different circumstances second half October regarding
 market’s terribly short term time. So, again, trying think
 treasurer would think it, think market dynamic considerations treasurer
 would think about, suggests maybe using except really extreme market
 circumstances.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. inclination reading memo
 weekend supportive proposal. However, given comments I’ve
 heard colleagues today, welcome additional time think concerns,
 especially issues President Rosengren raised five institutions borrowing.
 concerns President Hoenig raised whether introducing
 proposal like times really address stigma issue. memo also
 raises issue risk program would exacerbate moral hazard problem,
 I’m concerned this. heard lot comments today around table that, terms
 financial stress, it’s critical right thing play appropriate central bank role.
 So, again, like comments made earlier. great staff, skilled staff,
 came creative proposal, inclination support it. pleased
 additional time think issues better understand
 concerns raised. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, sympathy
 proposal. think creative. lot people around table know
 lot details market, works, treasurers work do,
 
 September 18, 2007
 
 158 188
 
 certainly defer judgment. couple points I’d like make. President
 Hoenig made point really gives little pause absorb this. I’m really worried
 law unintended consequences, don’t know right now. Many
 around table raised possibilities could exacerbate. think President
 Poole’s suggestion creating tension large small banks access
 could prove problem. also agree might unusual, would troubling if,
 fact, ended lending money facility going targeted funds rate, would
 maybe unlikely would complicate lives dimensions well.
 also worry bit look market—and probably generally
 provisions liquidity—that part problem price discovery. risk?
 risks, much they, price them? worry bit, too, degree
 providing liquidity shuts slows price-discovery process,
 something really want get done. don’t know answer question, it’s one
 sort struggle trying think whether hampering process
 price discovery, slowing making easier people, moving along
 faster rate. don’t know answer that.
 last point, think, policy question. Again, President Hoenig, think, made
 it. view temporary tool, think fine, important lay
 minds circumstances future would decide whether implement
 tool decide. criteria have? need something little objective
 whenever want to. worry bit failing abandon
 expectations market react might expect us use not.

 know consequences be? don’t know. I’m struggling
 kinds questions, little time think things would
 helpful. comments. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, time, bottom line
 proposal it’s okay, I’m altogether enthusiastic. It’s okay think
 another arrow quiver bad idea, done work put forward
 strikes clearly constructive. I’m enthusiastic didn’t find case
 compelling, let elaborate minute. probably would thought
 compelling week two ago, markets seemed working bit better, think it’s
 advantage let unfold, assuming continues so. broadly, think there’s
 question whether pricing we’re seeing term funding market something
 really addressing. Maybe, given concerns everything else, pricing
 perfectly fine moment adjust time something normal without action
 part. so, would strike preferable. real question end
 day seems though ultimate justification something like related
 macroeconomic objectives. believe that, say, malfunctioning short-term funding
 market going significant macroeconomic consequences? going make economy
 behave significantly worse perhaps economy otherwise would behaved? answer
 “perhaps,” don’t really real conviction that. that’s come out,
 moment anyway, “Yeah, could turn useful,” it’s hard get really
 enthusiastic it.

 moral hazard issue, course, isn’t anything really relieve people

 operations like old form discount window lending. Even normal functioning

 relief credit side. They’ll still tie capital, making good liquidity insurance,

 markets, fire sale aspect. think that, thought markets weren’t improving
 would feedback effect financial stability, stepping would worthwhile. That’s
 classic central bank thing do—to step relieve extra panicky pressures
 markets get functioning again. guess don’t see important moral hazard issue
 or, extent moral hazard issue, think would offset
 benefits macroeconomy functioning financial markets, decide
 needed markets weren’t working. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. briefly, think back week
 ago maybe one darker days we’ve past six weeks, many
 institutions funding overnight basis wouldn’t take much
 imagination us get fearful soon kind shock made
 impossible much difficult fund twenty-four hours later. think
 ACF would held great promise useful addressing headline risks
 could quickly systemic implications. think ACF holds great promise now.
 I’ll highlight one question, timing. share view put forth President
 Stern that, extent see markets improving terms, something
 we’ve seen recent trading days, wouldn’t want anything stop momentum.
 hit button today, may well would take stock new
 instrument compare alternatives have, improvement could
 potentially delayed. hand, wait markets deteriorate
 week ago, efficacy hitting button would also less ideal.
 sense timing—and it’s something Chairman will, think, brief us get
 
 September 18, 2007

 point—is extent see momentum stopped see ground weakening
 us, might make risk-adjusted call point. don’t think
 easy apparent one. balance, think macroeconomic possibilities
 pretty scary, makes suggest would lean forward this. Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also want congratulate staff.
 clever targeted intervention, it’s nicely put together proposal. I’m supportive.
 think it’s something that’s good available. I’m glad we’re planning put place
 instantly. potential address stigma issues banks coming
 discount window. Really, spike spread term overnight loans interbank
 market quite sizable, it’s obvious complicating difficulties
 banks managing liquidity.
 also concerned, given many borrowing rates linked LIBOR,
 spread remains elevated, potential spill rates lot
 borrowers pay. think chance succeeding reducing spread bringing
 LIBOR down, it’s 100 percent obvious succeed. think depend
 interpretation exactly spread represents, whether it’s credit risk liquidity risk.
 read proposal, thought really didn’t make case powerful way
 inability banks fund term creating systemic risk. seems that, given
 proposal magnitude involves coordinating central bank intervention chance
 succeeding, ought address something regard important
 systemic risk. comments Governors Kohn Warsh made convinced me,
 
 September 18, 2007

 discussed this, could well systemic risks might, things get
 worse again, want put place. found discussion useful. seemed
 case actually made document sense monetary policy case
 banks facing funding pressures would likely raise rates would
 macroeconomic consequences. suggests me, Well, don’t use federal funds
 rate more? general tool remove pressures.
 share concern perceived bailing small set weak institutions,
 including Washington Mutual, Countrywide, others may associated crisis.
 Especially we’re using overnight index swap rate. sitting here, guess, around
 4.80, 4.76, something like that, facility effect would
 funds rate would raise questions lending cheaply. One way another,
 would certainly happy approve swap agreement European Central Bank
 Swiss National Bank provide dollar funding whether go ahead not, that’s
 desirable.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. think proposal important advantage
 channeling funds place needed, macroeconomic consequences.
 think it, open market operations blunt tool. actually able direct
 credit market isn’t working. LIBOR market really working; clearly
 spreads way line. people talk what’s going market,
 basically say, “Yes, there’s arbitrage opportunity, there’s much risk can’t take
 advantage it.” something think important. example, understanding

 problematic us. maybe might want think whether 20 percent number

 time, would encourage staff think exactly issue.
 Another element important—which we’re saying marketplace
 we’re thinking using monetary policy tools; fact, credit problem,
 we’re thinking creatively use credit tools well. regard, there’s advantage
 thinking outside box trying deal another way. Let give
 analogy something August 17. August 17 pulled discount window.

 issues much taken up—but think would send signal

 We’re ready, think would help. I’m saying absolutely definitely use
 this, think Governor Warsh talked exactly right. we’re seeing there’s

 you.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. quick things. First, say
