 adopt object, need consist dual mandat. that’s obviou mean
 coupl thing. on long-run inflat rate would take account, among
 thing, zero bound. think issu. would comfort rang
 involv inflat rate, sai, 1 percent signific amount time,

 report good inflat outcom, press report optimist fed far
 inflat go go. would like put consider, sinc we’re go
