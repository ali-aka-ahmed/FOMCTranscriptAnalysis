 any, definitive answers.

 MR. PARRY. I'd like ask opinion credibility

 able that. guess one wouldn't want bet
 large immediate initial effect simply signing Neal

 MR. PARRY. Well, first all, strong credibility
 [model] assumed would take 2 years believed
 addition Neal amendment,
 that's fairly long time.
 thinking terms setting year-to-year targets, one
 question might ask.
 MR. PRELL. You're [layering] top ultimate objective

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Right, be--
 
 MR. PRELL. Clearly, haven't always achieved monetary

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Well, want echo Chairman Greenspan's
 compliments you. Even though [prefaced] remarks saying
 shows little know, still think
 fruitful exercise certainly fulfills
 asking terms kind presentation. One interest
 terms base case. suggesting
 could continuation impact 1996 1997 might
 involve outright deflation. Consequently, nice look
 earlier tight money phenomenon also brought rate
 unemployment natural rate. I'm asking is:
 Since we're already getting something don't know about, maybe
 might well go ahead another five years we're
 don't know about; thereby, would
 base case movement zero inflation 1995 [we
 
 12/18-19/89

 could] look adjustment natural rate unemployment.
 would also give us opportunity look current
 account deficit.
 That's presume taking base case
 [up to] 1996 cause interest rate adjustment, presume
 would [work] budget deficit also current
 account deficit interest rate effect. [we could]
 see might follow next five years. Would
 involve much more?
 MR. HOOPER.
 
 We'd consult model experts

 Well, certainly would hard day

 also wanted
 get reaction oil price shocks.
 seems maybe
 oil price shocks unrelated monetary policy. is,
 decided leave inflation rate 4-1/2 percent, might
 apt oil price shock, so-called oil price
 shock, would proceeded tighter fashion.
 MR. HOOPER. Yes, really would,
 underlying factors would tend increase probability oil price
 shocks.
 continue growth oil demand [unintelligible],
 would see production outside OPEC flat, would
 increase chance something happening there. world growth
 go significantly potential, would certainly reduce

 MR. ANGELL. fiscal side I'm afraid works
 way. is, point time pursue, example,

 MR. HOOPER. matters what's happening real

 say, alternative 2 pursuing [constant] 4-1/2 percent inflation
 rate alternative 3, say, assuming rate increase inflation

 There's guarantee one would encounter even likelihood

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let follow issue.
 impression would get you're suspecting 4-1/2
 percent model would tend keep unemployment rate
 moving dramatically. way econometric structure put
 together don't get type dynamics probably would occur.
 Since haven't asked question 6 months crucial area,
 one crucial areas whole business tradeoffs--the
 Phillips curve variations thereof relationship
 wages one hand gap whatever variation
 we're looking at--could review experience
 unemployment rate come down, obviously,
 last several years?
 great deal; wage rate gone less suspect
 earlier configurations model would indicated. Could
 address question specifically respect important
 is?
 words, minor issue one gives concern
 range potential error various different
 tradeoffs, projecting five-year period?
 MR. SLIFMAN. Well, Exhibit 10 chart lower
 panel shows simulation wage price sector taken
 together.
 So, Phillips curve also mark-up.
 sure, see 1984, said,
 substantial error; dissipated subsequent year
 half. recent period, dynamic simulation
 wage price sector together measured price variable
 pretty much right track. Now, also simulations
 wage equation alone. Again, true period
 model tending overpredict actual experience--that
 actual wages falling faster model would predicted.
 So, '81 roughly '85 period overprediction
 measured growth rate terms.
 since middle 1985,
 measured growth rate terms, model pretty much
 right track.

 MR. PRELL. Now, obviously, we're making decisions

 grant you:

 MR. PRELL. Let say, Larry referred this,
 underway comprehensive examination issue;
 overload reached requested briefing,

 MR. STOCKTON. would add, basis work
 we've done date, done experiment is, think,
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 exactly like would wish us do. is, taking
 personally this, went published literature
 pulled three different published equations paradigms. put

 Committee terms kind errors expect
 see horizon short 4 8 quarters. think that's
 much science bring bear issue
 moment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Lee Hoskins.
 
 Well, think that's fair statement.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Yes. Again, think staff good job
 terms laying alternatives; let compliment that.
 also compliment last statement think
 that's absolutely accurate. poor tools best
 them. Several comments already made,
 agree with. think Manley trying get idea,
 share content, [unintelligible] 1980 examples
 surely must upper limit sacrifice ratio, want
 put way. That's observation want make it.
 Now, I'm also struck [policy prescription]
 Milton Friedman James Tobin late 1970s early 1980s
 [implied a] horrendous cost keep inflation long
 period time. Again, overly critical kinds
 exercises, think staff 1983 ran roughly kind
 experiment Board. looked back exercise
 found substantially overestimates cost--at least looks
 like now--of getting inflation down. So, think run
 risk seeming err least one side exercises-unless bought full credibility model, case we'd
 probably run risk erring side it. said
 that, one observation I'd make, think Governor Angell
 getting at, measuring cost reducing inflation.
 one trying make decision whether it's
 worthwhile doing, one needs measure benefits zero
 rate inflation--that is, next 5 years 10 years--and
 compare cost transition, many us
 believe gains maintaining price stability terms
 economic performance.
 Finally, couple specific questions I'll
 rattle off: 1) international investors lose confidence
 dollar we've stabilized it? 2) I'd like explain
 relationship real interest rates deficit. 3)
 guess Wayne already made point, oil
 prices; would concur observation price stability
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 case you're much likely oil prices real terms perhaps
 declining rather rising.
 MR. HOOPER. Well, let address question
 willingness [to hold] dollar assets exchange disinflation.
 Clearly, rise real interest rates would favor
 dollar; case, current account deficit persistently
 [growing]--we're 1/2 percent GNP it's widening
 absolute terms. U.S. [external] debt growing levels
 perhaps could source concern point.
 shift [unintelligible] takes place, would hard say;
 it's one reasons considered two clearly marked
 certainly
 alternatives, obviously, since [unintelligible].
 couldn't rule distinct possibility movement
 dollar amounts external debt debt payments begin
 second question on-to stabilize [unintelligible].
 MR. HOSKINS. real interest rates related
 deficit economists might say empirically.
 MR. PRELL. Well, know there's reigning opinion this.
 Clearly, become much fashionable recent years take
 view kind correlation
 Board model, estimating
 conventionally [believed].
 relationships find traditional [unintelligible] budget
 deficit [tend] raise interest rates. may live
 [unintelligible] world can't detect it; means
 [unintelligible] correlation. [unintelligible],
 [big] increase government debt relative size
 economy tend raise interest rates. baseline
 we've assumed size government debt relative GNP
 [trending] down, would tend allow real interest rates
 [decline].
 MR. HOOPER. question oil prices: yes, clearly,
 discussed before, [successful] slowing
 real output, implications real oil prices would tend
 favorable. go back early 1980s, example,
 difference oil prices substantially higher levels
 begin with; perhaps part favorable outcome
 fact beginning side
 oil price shock. also small rise dollar.
 tended reduce somewhat [costs] disinflation
 world period, relative period oil prices
 dollar moving differently. point low
 relative level real oil prices. We're [assuming] production
 costs insensitive oil prices marginal areas.
 outlook production outside OPEC look
 particularly good. it's low downside limit oil price
 situation time compared early 1980s
 clearly strong downside potential.
 MR. HOSKINS. I'd comment Mike's budget [response].
 think fair statement deficit. also mentioned
 possibility [spurious] correlations. people argue
 may level government expenditures correlated
 deficits. That's one source it. Another source would change
 savings based something like appreciation stock market.
 
 -10-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, don't deny existence differing
 views this; view legitimate area continuing

 we've found best fits historical experience. [realize]

 kind real interest rate effect
 Board staff [model].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Mr. Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, Wayne Angell Lee Hoskins
 pretty well asked question I'd like ask slightly
 differently. I'm looking Exhibit 8. look four
 charts there: GNP deflator zero 1995;
 unemployment rate 1995 7 percent line heading down;
 real GNP potential growth; interest rates
 coming down. Using assumptions behind this, seems
 would happen would favorable
 picture. question then, course, is: happens 1995?
 know haven't done work. point know
 whether would expect continued decreases rate
 unemployment, continued growth GNP potential rate,
 interest rates possibly coming little could
 reach point 1995?
 MR. SLIFMAN. Well, it's much matter
 would expect; it's really question policy actions would
 taken point. expect policy action would
 taken point would ease monetary policy bring
 real interest rates way trying continue support
 real GNP bring unemployment rate closer natural
 rate. So, point I'm trying make end
 period unemployment rate, model, still
 substantially natural rate. [pose] continuous
 strategic problem because, unemployment rate
 natural rate point essentially inflation,
 model would want produce outright deflation, least
 time. That's really point trying make.
 MR. BOYKIN. Well, guess would always assume, maybe
 erroneously, course would make right policy decisions.
 unemployment rate holding steady 3 4 years
 downward slope line, wondered whether could
 expect continue.
 MR. SLIFMAN. Well, downward slope--and maybe it's
 problem way charted this--the rate going 7.2
 percent 7.0 percent. it's-MR. BOYKIN.
 MR. SLIFMAN.
 
 Yes, it's right direction.
 correct.
 
 -11-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 MR. PRELL. tried [unintelligible] bring
 get overshoot deflation. That's basic
 [thrust].
 One could come infinite number year-by-year
 paths here. couple things think broadly
 representative problem face.
 MR. SLIFMAN. Let also reemphasize point
 model incorporate credibility effects.
 seems
 likely, one successful bringing inflation way
 particular simulation shows, probably time
 credibility effects would begin build.
 final result
 terms costs probably would high simple
 simulation model wants produce.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. couple questions couple
 comments. First all, regard using Hoey Survey: know
 you've known long time; think administered
 truth serum would first tell
 shaky, flaky, sort survey wouldn't want using
 indication inflation psychology. Although understand need
 number, doesn't make good. Secondly, read
 here, I'm trying figure answer question: Credibility
 whom?
 group we're trying impress convince
 we're committed price stability?
 Frankly, get outside
 Beltway, people America don't know President
 United States is!
 fewer know Chairman Federal
 Reserve Board is.
 32 people college campuses 25 Fed
 watchers Wall Street never heard FOMC.
 MR. PRELL. Well, simple response would
 lack [a forum] achieve anything declaring intentions.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Well--
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 [Unintelligible.]
 
 MS. SEGER. sit assume everybody sitting
 edge chairs waiting see FOMC does.
 hate
 tell this, they're interested Redskins football
 game yesterday.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 made assumption.
 
 clearly--
 
 MS. SEGER. don't want disillusioning; maybe
 come unsophisticated part country like
 football. Also, list Exhibit 1 possible
 impediments price stability, agree jump world oil
 prices, fiscal policy miscues, etc.
 I'm depressed
 moves taken governmental bodies inflationary
 fiscal policy.
 I'm thinking microeconomic
 things.
 MR. PRELL. things fall roughly class supply
 shocks, along oil price change process.
 
 -12-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 MS. SEGER. don't call supply shock: putting

 SEGER.
 
 would call minimum wage hike supply

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Yes;
 
 regardless, shifts labor cost
 
 function.
 MS. SEGER. guess shock something
 comes blue something legislated

 MR. PRELL. Within ability incorporate things
 models, same.
 MS. SEGER. Okay. Also, couldn't sit listen
 easily comments early part decade
 Possibly Washington,
 disinflation costs great.
 D.C. didn't look great; sitting
 security government job government paycheck, perhaps
 didn't. tell lot people paid
 dearly disinflation. lost businesses; lost farms;
 lost jobs, they're still without them. I'm saying
 fight shouldn't waged; probably have. Maybe
 nationally cost marginal, two states assumed
 whole cost looked little heavy. Also, looking ahead
 sacrifices, think much micro analysis
 think far sectoral differences, doesn't
 average out.
 tell you--pardon?
 MR. PRELL. One things know didn't treat,
 example, distributional effects. That's something might
 want take consideration.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 think that's something look at,
 
 though.
 MR. PRELL.
 think we'd difficult time bringing
 concrete quantitative results that.
 isn't say
 it's something would want think about.
 MS. SEGER. Well, [remember] pieces 2X4s
 floated around building came builders early
 '80s!
 think suggests certain point sectoral
 burden gets little heavy, speak even it's
 flooding [us with] 2X4s. Anyway, thank you.
 interesting presentation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER.
 one question, Mike. mentioned
 beginning five years relatively short time frame
 sense, think, didn't get right way
 could slow money growth enough, quickly enough.
 don't want
 
 -13-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 read much said. question revolves around
 would happen sacrifice ratio time frame longer?
 think know would happen expectational effects
 credibility forth. sense that?
 made 10 years instead 5, sacrifice ratio come
 materially?
 MR. SLIFMAN. particular model, first
 approximation model linear regard sacrifice ratio
 calculations. So, stretched longer
 period time would still require cumulative excess
 amount unemployment; would stretched further--if,
 course, amount disinflation same.
 MR. MELZER.
 MR. SLIFMAN.
 
 So, would same?
 That's first approximation;
 
 precise.
 MR. PRELL. essence, 2 percentage points
 excess unemployment one year 1 percentage point two
 years, essentially effect terms this.
 MR. MELZER. then, believed it, becomes
 political question economic question--if model
 exactly right.
 MR. STOCKTON. Theory actually says
 announce something going terms money growth
 reduction future allowed people time adjust
 it, cost would actually lower. essence, follow
 line thought means say we're going something two
 three years now, workers Boeing, instance,
 would reduce wage demands anticipation
 [announced policy] going be. So, sense,
 [announcing] actions going may work--or it's
 model works theory--it doesn't seem sensible
 policy perspective expect that. terms getting early
 versus late, issue really five years isn't long
 time, even case might credibility, terms
 getting path whereby don't end five-year period
 major disequilibrium imbalance--like unemployment
 rate high. P* model tells similar kind story
 Board's quarterly model end big price gap
 end must mean either velocity far
 equilibrium and/or output far equilibrium.
 essence, longer get end point,
 adjustment occur. Within five-year period reach
 price stability general real output equilibrium much easier
 try quickly pushing
 hard one particular level.

 MR. FORRESTAL. couple comments, Mr.

 shove we're going back short-term policy making mode
 anyway.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's always good background
 framework notion we're going.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Sure, that's right. gut reaction,
 looked heard discussion today, cost

 presentation would suggest. may, comment
 would make that, even accept zero inflation base case,

 question whether getting are--at roughly 4-1/2 percent

 That's public policy question. guess raises question
 whether not, absence Neal legislation something
 like it, country accept cost bringing inflation

 seems me, quite applicable coming

 MR. KOHN. President Forrestal implicitly raised another
 question President Hoskins also raised, wrestled
 end. is: costs benefits
 going zero opposed steady rate inflation could
 maintain 4-1/2 percent? [concluded] one
 believes one's gut that's right thing do, that's
 way go. looking literature, isn't
 much enables pinpoint costs staying
 4-1/2 percent, able to, opposed going zero.
 things identify interactions
 tax system forth, shoe leather costs, not.
 hard quantify and, therefore, would
 difficult convince body politic of.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. crucial issue presupposes
 stay 4-1/2 percent choose to.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Right; that's correct.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Easier zero.
 
 Right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let also congratulate staff;
 really terrific presentation. 3 4 main things
 I, least, draw it. first important
 think would very, difficult safely conclude
 one could heck lot better summary Exhibit
 14, line 1. Now, doesn't say can't better.
 empirical evidence, United States foreign countries
 time periods covered exercise time
 periods covered exercise, suggests you'd very,
 hard pressed safely conclude could heck lot
 better line 1 Exhibit 14. think it's also important
 note regard look countries
 times, cases seen results tend
 sense different line 1 Exhibit 14 usually
 accompanied very, sharp fiscal adjustments--not kind
 gradual adjustment built base case here.
 second point would make look
 estimates costs qualified way have, think
 keep mind small costs human terms.
 That's partly, think, point Bob Forrestal raising.
 start talking sacrifice ratio 2.2 2.2 sounds like
 little number. terms behavior economy
 long period time carries rather profound
 implications. One profound implications
 very, careful leave wrong impression
 this. wrong impression way thinking
 think it's
 somehow "gimme putt," not.
 especially look beneath numbers even
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 -17-
 
 base case.
 already touched but, example,
 maintain current account deficit 2-1/4 percent GNP
 throughout whole period, don't know means absolute
 numbers rough arithmetic tells external debt
 percentage GNP would end 30 percent. We'd sneaking
 Brazil!
 don't know that's quite right, it's got
 order magnitude, another way saying even
 base case talking long period time GNP
 growth quite subdued historical standards and, even that,
 external side economic financial situation gets much
 worse many respects.
 said that, come back Governor Angell's comment
 earlier is: measure cost relative to?

 think it's absolutely unambiguous measure cost relative
 strategy accelerating inflation, that's easy. cost
 accelerating inflation obviously would greater fullness
 time. slower approach price stability?

 goal looks like 1954 1965 chart earlier
 presentation?
 think legitimate important
 questions, Mr. Chairman. perspective basic thrust
 Governor Angell said early exactly right terms "relative
 what?"
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let add something this.
 nothing game.
 words, don't either
 it.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 No.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. quite plausible start
 direction fine tune it, speak, year
 half, say, decide something accomplished
 declare victory.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That, course, I'm
 suggesting.
 last point would make is: think
 improve prospects getting better result, whether
 better defined relative Chart 14 something else?
 Here,
 must say I'm little dubious betting ranch
 credibility thing, even look countries
 thought high credibility, Germany, find
 periods '81 '85 period that's
 staff's chart costs quite real--as said,
 even credibility thought high. That's say-whether it's context Neal [resolution] something else-that [more] credibility might get somewhat better result.
 one would reluctant bet ranch, speak,
 so-called credibility argument. hand,
 prospects complementary policy initiatives could get
 savings/investment problem get productivity problem, that's
 different matter.
 framework 5- 6-year
 period, example, productivity growth average 1/2
 point built numbers,
 would looking different ball game.
 So, think
 line questioning terms helps irrelevant;
 gets back, course, important question fiscal
 policy. One things says you've right
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 -18-
 
 along; usually are.
 don't need balanced budget
 even balanced full employment budget; need surplus.
 probably need full employment surplus time frame order
 make either holes little rounder pegs little squarer.
 way cut up, think costs--whatever may be-obviously going much greater context
 exercise approached monetary policy monetary policy alone.
 think perhaps better line 1 Exhibit 14; I'm
 hard pressed think going better without
 complementary policies coming areas.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, questions points
 wanted make already made.
 One thing get
 get inflation tend get inflation
 much straight line route period time
 Someone made point earlier inflation
 different cycles.
 built 15-year period would peak
 subsequent cycle higher rate previous inflationary peak
 wouldn't drop low. wonder instructive
 terms one gets it.
 much would like say,
 example, want set course brings inflation
 next five years we're going hold there,
 must say reading history sense makes
 country like go doesn't encourage that's likely
 outcome. seem realistic--and [the course]
 really following '80s, design, certainly
 actions--is get inflation [progress] want
 period time bring peaks inflation
 bring troughs inflation cycle-to-cycle.
 different '80s kept inflation
 accelerating much cycle. Now, sooner later,
 recession. don't think anybody around table wants

 recession seeking one, sooner later one.
 recession took advantage anti-inflation
 [unintelligible] got inflation 4-1/2 percent 3
 percent, next expansion able keep inflation
 accelerating, sooner later another recession
 there.
 so, could bring inflation cycle-to-cycle
 let build cycle-to-cycle would
 considerable progress we've done periods
 history.
 seems it's [a policy] doable terms
 public political acceptability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 think [good]
 questions [have asked] perhaps satisfactory answers
 given; want join suggested
 quantified benefits zero inflation price stability. think
 intuitively would agree benefits; talk
 costs way quantify benefits,
 seems me.
 don't mean say shouldn't move toward price
 stability--or zero inflation, price stability--but rather
 set upon course ought know
 view, looking
 we're going achieve get goal.
 exercise, however good bad may be, we're really
 
 -19-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 serious price stability ought set course
 tight money policy get move economy
 could perform another number years satisfactory
 manner, could check beyond five years. also
 says short run, think policy
 put place now, doesn't worry much tight
 policy might skim along edge recession.
 say, immediate upcoming periods, fear recession simply
 isn't great seeing exercise might
 before; understand correctly, recession
 would expect get benefit moving toward price
 stability. Ed Boehne somebody said, don't think
 us looking recession, don't think shy away
 either.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. two comments Vice Chairman
 Corrigan said.
 would agree don't bet farm
 credibility; seems me, Jerry, you're assuming
 improvement credibility. don't-VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

 MR. PARRY. said thought

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. PARRY.

 Secondly, I--
 
 Wait minute.

 MR. PARRY. Beyond assumed model uses past

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 I'm saying would zero,

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 I'm saying you're citing

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 I'm citing limiting case
 
 it's zero.
 MR. PARRY. Well then, misunderstand credibility

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. He's saying Germany

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'm saying take

 conclude safely could much better that. went
 say things might permit somewhat

 very, cautious much think might help.
 That's I'm saying.
 MR. PARRY. regard stating objectives conditioned

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Well, we're charge happens prices.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Say again.
 
 That's I'm saying.
 
 Well, didn't understand then.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'm referring Federal Reserve
 policy. I'm saying credible fiscal policy

 budgetary agreement struck independently White House
 Congress, would help.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 don't deny that.

 I've attending meetings 30
 things.
 years almost time 16 years period
 time don't think we've addressed topic quite important
 we're now. know one would lot confidence
 econometric measures one would use determine costs
 eliminating inflation are, comes important
 qualitative differences various approaches.

 backward-looking model, traditional way we've looked
 here, makes cost very, high. assume
 something like rational expectations forward-looking
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 -22-
 
 expectations assume kind
 credibility strength credibility, cost becomes
 considerably less. think Manley made good point ago,
 Lee picked on, said maybe worst case one
 early '80s really hit economy big
 shock without announcing exactly going do. don't
 think really anticipated rates going go
 anything like high; yet vantage point, seems
 costs relatively low. certainly costs,
 relatively low. something like Neal
 resolution passed, could state targets--I would like
 say multiple years rather one year--in advance come
 close eliminate base drift, think costs
 nearly scary seem concluding here. Finally,
 I'd like pick Governor Angell's point cost
 aiming zero inflation, alternative. think
 lot experience postwar period. think
 costs great; substantial risks evolve
 sort program. case try
 [unintelligible] rational expectations extent

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. always, think history interesting way

 indeed result exogenous events shocks

 monetary policy cause that. seems

 that's
 way achieve best results, I'd reluctant

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Lee.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Let ask question again,
 generally, anybody wants take on: sitting
 1980 1979 looking estimates either

 seems benefits, whatever are, price stability

 don't know they're going come out.
 know we've done
 past tried estimates; we've done
 past overestimate cost, least several cases I've

 looked at.
 think cautious saying

 ought look benefits one, course, probably

 potential benefits don't want run now.
 I'm sure

 putting arms around them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, come necessarily
 non-professional economist point view happen
 share trying form policy. listen presentation,
 try ask myself: make sense do? see
 situation we've got huge uncertainties. Many
 model admitted right front; necessarily
 there. lot can't possibly model, even though
 may know are.
 Then, course, whole
 host don't even know might [arise] time goes
 on.
 It's easy see, Governor Seger points out,
 potential human costs here; huge make mistake.
 haven't taken look yet possible second five-years
 might result getting get model.
 what, course, may quite possibly biggest threat
 political threat: could easily set
 course, incur costs, political realities
 abort process got benefits.
 might worst
 worlds and, possibly, fairly plausible one.
 So, might
 make sense two things sound fairly simple
 simplistic, may pretty good challenge themselves.
 One
 simply work get trends moving right direction without
 terribly close attention slope curve--just get
 moving right direction. second work hard
 damp volatility around slope curves.
 speed
 advance secondary importance.
 get moving
 right direction, given uncertainties, think sometimes
 we'll able make fairly rapid progress times slow
 progress; sometimes we'll well hold ground.
 get
 recession might even take one step back.
 basically [we should] try figure ways set conditions
 able get slope curves moving
 correct direction time, without give terribly much
 attention one particular time period.
 MR. ANGELL.
 question for, think, Kohn.
 others monetary research wish come in, that's fine.
 It's
 difficult sometimes know M2 growth path really [apt]
 restrain changing opportunity costs holding M2,
 example. I'm wondering: we're environment
 rate interest declining annual rate 100 basis points-or good portion period June December,
 guess, declining 250 basis points annual rate--how adjust
 M2 know whether still restraint place
 declining interest rate scenario? how, hand,
 know really restraint place rising interest rate
 scenario?
 
 -24-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 MR. KOHN. That's difficult question one
 thought regard Committee's decision tomorrow
 morning, fact, situation M2
 running pretty rapidly. One see it's really function
 drop opportunity costs interest rates rather
 overrun current-quarter GNP. time, going
 say tomorrow morning strikes note caution
 money supply moves fast. many people would put money right
 prices; sense, it's part complex set
 interactions. question whether interest rates,
 perhaps exchange rates, gotten money supply growth
 paths going lead time future higher rates
 increases inflation. think we've learned time
 money supply grows rapidly long periods time, even
 though explain contemporaneously past declines
 opportunity costs, inflation rate, [unintelligible], it's cautionary
 summons. It's warning bell going off. P* model attempt
 cut say: Suppose velocity grows
 long-run trend output grows long-run trend,
 money statistical sense feed prices?
 right P* P. We've got sense restraint on,
 think one Dave's charts, Exhibit 4, see
 projected growth money gets isn't
 difference P P* early part 1990
 rises money growth eases off. don't think there's
 easy answer question, Governor Angell. Ultimately, would
 crank whole thing big model interest rates
 money demand sort thing. P* model tends
 cut bit. think attention money
 growth rates get high low provides sense
 discipline central bank make sure it's going far
 track one way another. that's essentially P* attempts
 do.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, take table 1 Mike's December 14th memo:
 table 1 show accelerated disinflation path much lower
 [money growth] rates; presume interest rates declining
 toward end show somewhat higher rates.
 MR. KOHN. point take account
 decline velocity, so-called reentry problem.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. KOHN. So, nominal rates coming
 inflation coming down, point you've got increase
 real money supply take account drop nominal rates
 velocity react that. different
 scenarios; earlier later sense.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, Don, guess bottom line
 question is: somewhat advantaged due fact
 last 30 months we've M2 growth rate something 4
 5 percent? give us better basis watching 5-year
 scenario period we--? guess I'm
 asking is: start, opinion?
 
 -25-
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 MR. KOHN.
 think do, because--putting
 terms--what M2 growth done monetary restraint
 effect contained inflation least, longer
 seems accelerating. you're much better shape
 started position M2 growing 2 percentage
 points faster inflation threatening accelerate.
 really would sacrifice make. sacrifice ratio might
 different, total sacrifice might be.
 So, absolutely,
 think acting restraint last couple years
 simplified made little less painful job next 5 years
 aim zero inflation. getting inflation

 said that, couple technical
 things wanted ask. First, even one agrees that, still
 trouble deciding definition price stability. think
 came association language Neal bill
 reasonably acceptable, honestly trouble
 trying say it's level CPI, level PPI,
 deflator. many difficulties associated pinning
 particular strict quantitative measure I'm sure
 it's realistic. So, seems definition price stability
 flexibility associated within narrow range. Now,
 don't know exactly it, think agree price
 stability really ought spend lot time want
 define it.
 Secondly, think important distinguish
 benefits stabilizing inflation rate stabilizing
 concept price stability.
 theory, think assume
 people could always anticipate inflation growing specific
 rate I'm sure cost pegging inflation rate much
 greater cost stabilizing price level.
 don't
 believe way; I'm sure could stabilize
 inflation rate. fact people could always
 assured prices going grow 4 percent, could take
 account like stable price level.
 question
 is: relative prices somehow better behaved stable price level
 environment stable inflation rate environment?

 don't know; I'm asking.
 reason empirically
 theoretically believe relative prices goods services
 predictable price level stability environment versus
 inflation rate stability environment?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let stop right there.
 general question raised really next topic
 address coffee. So, let's take 15 minute break [return].
 [Coffee break]

 I'd like put table

 Combining that:

 MR. JOHNSON. Let repeat last question left

 benefits inflation rate target versus price level
 stability target. talking Bob Parry break
 raised another question, is: exogenous shock,

 punch line think it's good state

 people don't care price level stability, value
 judgments. get far line people

 telling us we're going 4 5 percent inflation.
 MS. SEGER. Yes, America bigger financial

 something that's vague general, judgment, would still make

 MR. SYRON. Well, Mr. Chairman, think we're
 extraordinarily difficult tricky situation try
 [unintelligible] public sentiment. struck, give
 talks discuss need Federal Reserve disciplined
 disciplined getting inflation down--and I'm
 talking business groups, community activists--that
 haven't anyone come complain. It's akin John's
 point inflation really high now. come say
 is: can't get rates machine tools aren't
 selling isn't happening isn't happening. So, think
 way we're going get anywhere--and it's long-term
 process--is demonstrate cost inflation is. think
 lot improvement personal living standards
 driven increases participation rate labor force
 norm two-worker family rather singleworker family. inflation factors, productivity
 hasn't rising real wages haven't rising. need get
 saving rate up. show people
 children future going better low inflation
 world now. don't understand now,
 going support that. think it's very, important
 try make case demonstrate clearly
 possible constraints Federal Reserve it:
 can't do. I'm disagreeing can't get rid
 inflation, cost? depends upon people
 do. I'm talking things like minimum wage,
 protectionist legislation, different steps taken
 medical care costs, things. Someone told long time
 ago shock absorber terribly lasting profession;

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Ed Boehne.

 means pushing unemployment risking recession. think
 would public disservice somehow pretended

 think would get short circuited fairly quickly. don't
 think amount education persuasion do,
 barring hyper-inflation kind experience like Germans had,
 ever educate public bear even kinds costs
 we're talking here. think support

 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, think fact
 pretty much agree Neal resolution pass sends us

 think sense, Congress among certain
 people, decline inflation probably appropriate. But,

 MR. HOSKINS. think political issue troublesome
 one it's clearly reflected views people put forth
 around table afternoon. look problem one
 changing attitudes. democracy, Ed Boehne indicated.
 Democracies learn change. think requires us

 Five years ago wouldn't guessed would amendment

 change time people pursue aggressively. Five years ago

 say can't change things don't currently popular

 MR. ANGELL. Constitution, know, give
 Congress authority control money supply protect

 decided delegate responsibility us. seems
 it's far, far worse us held task Congress
 job they, sense, expect us regard
 price level stability. criticism take place too.
 would far rather position saying little
 committed responsibility would criticize
 us letting inflation run. Economic growth stated Full
 Employment Act '46 full employment mentioned
 Humphrey-Hawkins Act. seems know
 best way [foster] economic growth price level stability,
 it's job best economic growth--which is,
 course, put price level stability first. believe that,
 think it's sellable.
 Now, agree Manley Johnson said beginning

 Manley, joined Board involved, first

 reason? Well, think going 12 percent 3
 percent inflation rate unexpectedly produced certain shocks
 threatening upset entire financial community.
 think third world debt commodity producers everywhere--the
 world ready worry. think make
 sense level 3 percent; really slipped
 back 4-1/2 percent. So, think it's logical us,
 done first step, take second step.
 think going 4-1/2 percent zero tough going
 12 percent 3 3-1/2 percent wherever was. seems
 we're going sell won't sell talking tradeoffs. don't sell saying: "Oh, we're going go
 produce recession that's exactly want we're
 going put enough pain everybody become committed
 raising prices." That's way sell it. really
 need focus call price level targeting; that's
 like use commodity prices way saying we're trying
 create slack. We're trying create unemployment;
 recognize commodity price level, however measured, moved
 restrain move. think there's support
 that. Now, fiscal side, believe Federal Reserve
 fault federal budget deficit Congress.
 Federal Reserve double-digit inflation rates
 caused tax receipts rise 16 18 percent per year.
 wouldn't Congress get used spending rate? We're
 ones taught Congress spend, bringing rate
 inflation down, course, shuts receipts impose
 rather significant burdens. don't think anyone would suggest
 Congress doesn't significant problems. Rather
 saying ought [content] can't get inflation rate
 down, think ought little sympathetic Congress'
 problem. Getting budget deficit period declining
 inflation pretty tough do. think need sympathetic

 That's don't think

 think smaller consumer price increases second

 Higher interest rates?
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Don't higher interest rates abroad mean

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, yes, depends whether

 therefore, sense [economic activity] would less

 changes we've seen far year could argue
 dollar much lower is--that change dollar
 much greater we've since June something like
 that. sense undershot kinds weak relationships
 shouldn't rely on.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, let get straight
 that. asked question: dollar weaker forecast
 higher rates abroad, since we're projecting-MR. TRUMAN. point making really
 question timing. last three forecasts going July
 year end forecast period net change
 dollar we've assumed projected same.
 period extent we've raised growth abroad time
 we've also raised interest rates bit. However, seems
 sooner [straight] line projection
 we've assumed. Therefore, Mike said, move
 exogenously. didn't fine tune forecast [to extent]
 real side price effects, original
 forecast would come 1992, moved forecast
 [for 1991].
 I'm sure I'm answering question but-MR. JOHNSON. Yes, [unintelligible].
 last question
 one keep repeating--I know you're sick hearing
 I'm still looking answer too. is: year ago
 even less slightly stronger forecast. realize
 go back last April's FOMC weakness
 values projected [were showing up] early 1990 rather
 year. economy softened bit toward tail end
 year forecast earlier projections
 actually forecasting 10-1/2 percent funds rate
 10 percent long bond now. Yet rates fully 200 basis
 points lower forecast real economy
 expected little stronger today. I'm still
 trying find way reconciling that--how occurred
 interest rate scenario totally different we've
 much lower interest rates. economy slightly
 weaker forecast, don't think could dollar.
 Exports held pretty well whole forecast. fact,
 thought lags longer that; least that's we've
 saying. it's export side. weakness
 occurred? forecast borne generally,
 structure interest rates 200 basis points lower?

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, conditions District seem

 levels down. consequence, expectation

 100 days' supply, maybe more, awfully high. Consequently,
 said, production schedules first quarter going

 reason relates incentive
 business.
 hear everybody saying opportunity
 incentive programs, already fairly heavy
 terribly important negative effect earnings.
 I'm told, therefore, isn't quite much room
 incentive side people might believe response bigger
 incentives cuts production. dealer level
 attitudes pretty sour. Many dealers claiming
 facing serious financial problems risk
 automakers may lose dealers.
 said that, think it's
 important keep perspective: we're talking
 sales volume 1989, including cars light trucks, 14.7
 14.8 million, would even bad fourth
 quarter. previous years still disaster.
 1990 expectation first quarter low, say,
 14.1 million sales, pickup second

 improvement farm sector. [steel] business, 1989
 shipments expected 83 million tons, less
 1988 significantly so. outlook 1990 suggests
 81 million tons--again down, still disaster.
 retail side, think it's early see Christmas going

 inflation front, think outlook become somewhat

 Therefore, perspective, inflation outlook improved.

 doubts, doubts whether economy would quite

 anything sort; always looking previous year.
 say it's worst ever really might seasonally
 adjusted improvement. Anyway, said things one would
 expected say. universally pessimistic;
 hasn't meeting since last recession directors
 uniformly pessimistic one.

 anecdotal information pretty much along lines.
 We're bit optimistic staff is, though, toward end
 1990 first part 1991; [we're expecting] GNP pick
 primarily export improvement. think it's quite
 possible, probably likely, domestic demand stronger
 staff suggesting forecast.
 think lower
 interest rates may well compatible efforts control
 inflation, staff projecting essentially flat interest
 rates.
 Finally, I'm bit optimistic prices are.
 It's great comfort P* model, think
 great piece work, projecting [unintelligible] next year.
 looking way see market working, profits

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd like say one thing.
 would stay symmetrical agreement that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let say quick word
 financial fragility issue. say confidence I'm
 probably sensitive anybody room, think
 we've got keep perspective. First, come
 from? think two basic sources: one macroeconomic
 imbalances we've living long time
 fundamentally reflect policy mix problem; second source
 regard excesses, maybe even outright

 important segments real economy, including nonfinancial
 corporate sector real estate sector. Obviously,
 sensitive fragility even though may like causes.
 think we've got extremely careful sanction
 causes. sensitive, yes; sanction, no.
 "B,"
 
 terms policy, see three options they're "A,"
 "C" Bluebook terms. Basically are: first, keep
 
 asymmetric--perhaps strongly asymmetric--directive nothing
