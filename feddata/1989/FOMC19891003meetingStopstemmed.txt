 second.
 
 without object.
 
 mr. cross, you've
 
 i'm even go report todai!
 probabl mean doesn't want
 
 [statement--see appendix.]
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 question mr. cross?
 
 mr. hoskin. rel ceil [on
 hold foreign currenc]? anticip
 intermeet period ahead term rais [$20
 billion] ceil?
 mr. cross. $1-1/2 billion
 ceil. whether go prove necessari request

 treasuri, mean could substanti amount
 intervent--$3 billion worth--befor would come
 ceil.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor johnson.
 
 mr. johnson. sam, coupl thing
 thought didn't come quit clearli report.
 first
 all, g-7 communiqu said look like dollar line
 certainli disagre that,
 exist fundament.
 guess on could debat point. communiqu also said,
 specif follow-up languag, g-7 would consid
 counterproduct dollar rose current level fell
 sharpli.
 term exchang rate strategi, understand
 certainli implic concert
 attack dollar. mention strategi gener
 resist upward pressur, time repeatedli
 concert effort drive dollar lower then,
 ratchet down, hammer even start show upward
 pressur lower level.
 so, think it's bit semant
 issu talk resist upward pressur fact
 clear strategi ratchet dollar. even though
 massiv level dollar sold, kind strategi--especi
 we've never particip far eastern market regular basi--in
 opinion grossli destabil.
 thought scari
 event, can't see us condon sort strategi.
 think
 it's potenti veri, danger.
 
 10/3/89
 
 mr. cross. well, word communiqu exactli
 said exactli read statement--that

 rise excess declin could advers affect prospect.
 would sai, though, veri, major differ
 go hammer dollar fall market
 resist rise. didn't alwai resist
 immedi show increas; resist
 rise let market take some. obvious, market

 knew g-7 try guid dollar some.
 point make recogn try take account
 of, much could, risk could follow realli
 go hammer dollar fall, didn't
 realli do.
 mr. johnson. well, let ask question. kind
 technic agreement within g-7 target band exchang
 i'm certainli awar ani. is,
 rate now?
 specif?
 mr. cross.
 mr. johnson.
 
 far i'm awar, none.
 quantit understand

 mr. cross.
 awar target rang
 exist. month month ago, don't think

 mr. cross.
 mr. johnson.
 
 well, talk everi dai-what object?
 
 mr. cross. object curb dollar's rise
 declin some. want fall enorm-mr. johnson.
 
 where?
 
 mr. cross. discuss everi dai follow
 dai.
 fallen littl time time; fall
 massiv amount dai. discuss other, base
 close level new york, sai, tuesdai, might
 sensibl target.
 mr. johnson. put posit somebodi
 market conclud communiqu meant
 market.
 g-7 want lower dollar, [not as]
 resist [a rise] current level. thei're try figur
 fundament ar; target goe along
 sound like even don't know.
 fundament?
 even understand dollar ought be.
 mr. cross. understand rise
 occur help. effort bring
 greater stabil reduc dollar somewhat. on know
 need move dollar xyz point order assur
 
 10/3/89
 
 meet longer-term [fundament].

 intent, far i'm concern, try take awai
 upward momentum let eas somewhat. but, sai,
 hasn't fallen much haven't driven
 much. we're level saw august--that's less two
 month ago--and saw earlier mai. i'm sure
 dollar show signific rise approach would
 chang.
 chairman greenspan. let answer, governor johnson.
 best wai defin involv rang
 dollar, much variou govern would will
 commit.
 think best wai describ agreement
 would moder intervent intervent knock
 dollar significantli, did, fine.
 not, agreement us unlimit resourc
 break market. origin propos shot
 down. sens, rather talk term
 ultim goal, think appropri issu
 restraint guidelin degre
 resourc place market.
 mr. johnson. well, sinc notion
 dollar commit dollar, would
 happen dollar collaps yet you'd spent
 third commit?
 mr. cross.
 mr. johnson.
 mr. cross.
 
 would stop.
 would keep spend it?
 no.
 
 mr. hoskin.
 
 stop?
 
 mr. johnson.
 
 stop?
 
 chairman greenspan. that's variou meet
 central bank involv insist upon look
 go secondari market--so evid
 cumul deterior would induc real pull back.
 realli wasn't countri versu countri. financ minist
 central bank governor.
 you're troubl find
 rang polici is, [that becaus] you're
 look committe.
 tri get consist dai-by-dai
 scenario, ted truman put it, mani branch
 possibl. went dai-by-dai, restraint
 criterion amount resourc avail,
 particular target.
 mr. johnson. well, that's case, think it's even
 danger thought first start
 convers. spent $400 million interven five time
 market yesterdai dollar around 139 yen
 1.87 d-mark, yet don't know we're go.
 mr. cross.
 enter almost
 dollar move 139.
 
 10/3/89
 
 mr. johnson.
 
 well, fraction.
 
 mr. cross. knew point particularli
 sensit market dollar got close 140 [yen]
 went order try keep go 140
 level. didn't enough keep go through.
 mr. johnson. hear descript, think there's
 risk risk premium go continu grow. much
 uncertainti here, imagin uncertainti
 might market can't even figur what's go
 on.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 that's quit fair.
 
 vice chairman corrigan.
 [laughter].
 governor johnson!
 
 you're shoot messeng here,
 
 mr. johnson. well, realiz resist lot
 [intervent] strategi [among committe member],
 think ought step resist.
 mr. boehn. i'd like pursu convers along
 market saw kind
 somewhat differ line.
 intervent--and dollar come down--on reason might
 think would come govern go spend
 second act
 kind monei, must second act.
 so,
 might understand basic polici chang.
 first question is: discuss intervent,
 kind understand intervent follow
 fundament chang econom polici, whether
 monetari side fiscal side?
 chairman greenspan.
 mr. johnson.
 
 answer "no."
 
 market think so.
 
 mr. boehn.
 think market would think so,
 peopl probabl would agre intervent, except rare
 situat, rather temporari influenc unless follow
 someth fundament.
 chairman greenspan. ed, true among academician;
 belief now,
 true among financ minist.
 particularli among japanes, steril intervent put

 convinc secretari bradi futil effort,
 
 10/3/89
 
 market try tell us someth, fight
 rather fruitless task. whether succe, don't know.
 vice chairman corrigan.
 vice chairman corrigan. coupl point: first all,
 there's absolut question percept--whether it's realiti
 not--that central bank try beat dollar
 veri, danger thing; would agre that. mai
 agre perhap understood amount effort
 gone try minim kind problem could
 aris current circumst treasuri
 elsewher. mayb hasn't pristin pure perfect
 execut think thrust effort vein.
 but, again, real question on ed boehn start ask
 real debat, seem me, threshold
 obvious, governor johnson sai effect
 question ar.
 imbal. isn't quit said it's-mr. johnson. don't sai that.
 recogn

 mr. johnson. central bank particip
 first all, we've make statement

 price stabil point think almost
 "johnni-on-note" issu. peopl, think, start
 us counter ridicul
 believ us.
 approach doesn't make sens; [it introduc] potenti doubt
 there. central bank continu particip kind
 strategi show even compromis it, think extent
 market go sai joke--in fact, balanc
 goal current account versu price stabil. now,
 posit well known want go gradual goal;
 sure don't current account goal ahead goal price
 stabil. think we'd announc world
 least equal concern bring intern current

 vice chairman corrigan.
 
 don't think that's question
 
 here.
 mr. johnson.
 mr. angel.
