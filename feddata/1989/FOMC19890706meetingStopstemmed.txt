 i'm quit concern.
 
 also, let make brief point context mr.

 ask question
 context current polici: possibl, first, rise
 inflat rate stabil--that it's go anymor?
 there's reason chanc that's true, don't think it's
 bake cake. even assum bake cake,
 next question ask myself, relev
 18-month period, is: would take bui back
 acceler inflat rate past 18
 month? forget long-term price stabil moment;
 ask would take get back were.

 plausibl set reason believ could recaptur

 chairman greenspan.

 vice chairman corrigan. that's right. mayb

 it's nice talk it, skeptic
 
 even achiev intermedi goal bui back we've
 alreadi lost without incur real cost, much less get
