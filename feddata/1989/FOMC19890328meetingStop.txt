 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 would think so.
 
 MR. PARRY. Okay. Well, case certainly would favor
 alternative B asymmetric language present time. However,
 signs slowing become convincing next
 several weeks, would certainly recommend consider moving
 alternative C promptly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, favor holding policy steady
 period ahead, period next weeks anyway. hunch
 one that's [in forecast] also one
 made assuming increase funds rate
 probably going needed later keep inflationary pressures

 want directive asymmetrical. think it's also possible
 we've done enough, particularly looking behavior M2

 watch closely may well wrong that. Certainly,
 current statistics reflect anything would suggest

 conclusion time pause. that's really
 think focus ought right now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, know Mr. Chairman,
 blow hot cold this, put mildly. probably changed
 mind right thing every hour
 past two weeks. clearly think we've got maintain tilt
 toward firmness; indeed, think preference would actually
 come somewhere "B" "C" right now. Let
 elaborate two basic reasons that's preference
 lies. first is, I've said before, seems
 period immediately front us baked cake
 price statistics going tend bad side.
 think that's kind locked in. "bad" don't mean anything like
 January-February PPI numbers something range 5
 percent higher. Again, forecast hunches soft
 landings prove right could get lucky.
 hand, forecast hunches soft landings wrong
 pause rather slowdown think real trouble,
 another way saying still think risks
 distinctly asymmetric.
 another concern reinforces tilt [preference].
 is, notwithstanding Kohn's Chart 7--which agree
 pretty impressive look at--I still worry changes
 financial system structure may well produced situation
 takes higher level nominal real interest rates
 get degree restraint might associated
 nice neat relationship Chart 7. leads
 couple things. First all, look around right
 evidence see credit availability problems.
 There's plenty credit there. shouldn't surprise us, given
 structural changes financial system on.
 means, course--and Ted Truman touched this--is one way
 another restraint come price effects. Price effects
 either mean exchange rate--and exchange rate
 complicates immensely medium-term problem spoke earlier
 morning--or one way another interest rates.
 I'm sure much know today way
 interest mechanism works. example, take consumer
 sector: it's unambiguously clear rising interest rates net
 positive impact personal income even take account
 floating rate mortgages home equity loans. Now,
 doesn't tell much; make lot judgments
 relative propensities consume. it's unambiguous terms
 cash flow effect consumer sector whole.
 
 -37-
 
 3/28/89
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. adjustable rate mortgages
 25 percent total mortgages.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That's true. That's
 right now. hand, business sector clearly hurt
 cash flow terms rising interest rates was.
 get anomalous effect least cash flow terms
 effects rising interest rates problem place
 need spending activity rather consumer sector
 go way. another illustration
 financial engineering, we're familiar swap
 market emerging markets interest rate caps,
 collars, floors. market, couple years
 old, know $300 billion size think probably
 $500 billion size. market didn't even exist three years ago!
 reflection way market working recent
 months, open interest Euro-dollar futures contracts Chicago
 $760 billion. Now, don't know
 things interact terms way monetary restraint works
 system interest rate channels. hunch
 that, anything, probably works slow rather speed
 up. that's second reason tilt.
 said preference would lie "B" "C" right now,
 guess go along formulation spirit Bob
 Parry's earlier comments.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, would favor
 recommendation, namely, alternative B. point certainly
 would continue favor asymmetric language. go
 operational aspects but, market's perception
 fed funds rate target is, say, 9-3/4 9-7/8 percent,
 seem period may natural
 wouldn't resist rate
 upward pressure rate.
 moving 9-7/8 10 percent, whereas would resist if,
 fact, rate began trend downward. So, I'd clear bias
 toward allowing rate go up.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, Si Keehn Bob Parry already pretty
 is, I'm afraid
 much emphasized would want point out.
 market participants believe targeting federal funds
 rate closely juncture. So, favor "B" think it's
 important, pause process tightening here, make
 sure pause right place don't give market signal

 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm sensing
 theme conversation it's time pause,
 certainly share that. Consequently, comfortably support

 little earlier touching matter lags,
 is: put place already enough [restraint] get us
 want?
 It's sense moment I'm hurry

 really personally would prefer symmetric language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MS. SEGER. preference change, guess
 "B" symmetric language. said number people,
 substantial tightening last 12 months so;
 interest rates risen rather dramatically. known
 lags, much tightening yet felt economy.
 Also, Manley said, signs slowing.

 personally would argue there's going coming,
 particularly housing auto industry.

 mentioned think thrift situation something
 aware of, reason could easily something
 would make cost bailout quite bit higher. Also,
 despite Brady plan, don't believe we've solved third world
 debt problem; maybe it's coming don't think done.
 much additional tightening, think, could negatively impact
 third world nations.
 Finally, I'm concerned dollar
 perhaps performing Ted people think will--that
 stay strong prevent export expansion
 want which, turn, make even difficult narrow
 trade deficit.
 So, reasons would prefer sit
 tight symmetrical language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, think somewhat
 firmer policy moment would appropriate. judgment
 are, fact, experiencing pause sustained downturn

 even pause, even seeing
 real slowing, think risks recession firmer policy
 minimal. Greenbook forecast, agree,
 predicated upon tightening beginning second quarter--some
 tightening moment--and produce
 recession 1990. Moreover, produce great
 improvement inflation rate.
 So, think
 don't need back off, think need continue pressure
 reserves order stay ahead inflation curve. ought
 go ahead job make tightening move. wouldn't

 whatever equivalent borrowing is, would appropriate.
 preference would move small degree.
