 Thank you, gentlemen.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 2/7-8/89
 
 MR. JOHNSON. one question: first alternative
 forecast, happens case don't compensating
 money growth try stay base line real GNP forecast
 unchanged dollar?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, case, course, would get
 current account improvement, better performance prices,
 little less--about 1/4 percent per year less--GNP growth.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 What's improvement price side?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Oh, difference think 0.2 percent
 year years, 1989 [and 1990].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. couple questions.
 First,
 showing compensation going rather rapidly 1990--plus 6 percent-but showing personal consumption expenditures going
 0.9 percent. What's happening there--the saving rate?
 MR. PRELL. Well, job growth much slower; thus, you're
 generating nominal income fast enough offset rapid
 increases consumer prices.
 MR. HELLER.
 MR. PRELL.
 increase is.
 
 6 percent?
 I'm sure nominal personal income
 
 MR. HELLER. No, no.
 charts looks like
 compensation going 5.7 5.8 percent--whatever is, don't
 know.
 MR. PRELL.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 slow employment growth.
 get zero.
 
 MR. STOCKTON. get 5 percent consumer price
 inflation well what's pushing overall growth real
 disposable income.
 MR. HELLER. second question was: Foreign prices
 falling rather rapidly forecast 1990, view
 fact foreign monetary growth right lot higher
 United States virtually countries except Switzerland
 what's magic?
 MR. TRUMAN. think magic slightly
 higher money growth lower level [inflation]
 average begin recently--with important exceptions
 like United Kingdom--and projecting tightening
 monetary policy countries. Also, two-year period,
 including 1990, get benefit depreciation

 comparisons, would coming artificial factors
 
 2/7-8/89
 
 1989 tend boost price level Germany Japan.
 Therefore, year-over-year comparison exaggerates decline.
 MR. PRELL. Governor Heller, clarify: figures
 compensation hourly wages. total nominal disposable
 income rising 6 percent. take 5
 percent consumer inflation you're 1 percent income
 growth real terms.
 MR. HELLER. Okay. last question: chart 18, next
 last chart, lot faster growth abroad
 unchanged dollar forecast.
 Presumably would mean higher U.S.
 exports, yet current account gets lot worse?
 MR. TRUMAN. Right, [unintelligible]
 exports. There's doubt that: [faster] growth abroad
 boost growth exports period.
 might add-MR. HELLER.
 
 two U.S. growth paths exactly
 
 same.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. That's right, that's assumption.
 extent get exports, easing monetary policy
 required keep U.S. growth path line less;
 that's part compensated-MR. HELLER.
 
 No.
 
 I'm sorry, don't get it.
 
 MR. TRUMAN. extent that's correct--that without
 dollar's decline growth abroad--that
 partial effect generates exports.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 exports?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Growth [abroad] generate
 exports. extent produces demand U.S. goods,
 experiment offsets less monetary expansion
 United States compensate exports would otherwise
 there.

 Governor Heller.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 Well, fact, puts two factors together,
 
 I'm ready give up.

 MR. TRUMAN. growth exports lower forecast
 even though income abroad higher gain
 price side lose income side.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 goes price effects?
 
 fact,
 Prices actually washed out.
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes.
 probably better way thinking level real

 MR. HELLER.
 exports up.
 
 Sorry.
 
 thought heard say initially
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No.
 
 MR. HELLER.
 
 you're saying exports
 
 [not]
 
 up--
 
 MR. TRUMAN. partial effect higher income put
 exports up.
 partial effect stronger dollar put exports
 down. net effect negative exports.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Sorry confusion.
 
 MR. HELLER.
 
 find hard see, but--

 MR. PRELL.

 say.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. HELLER.
 
 Well, certainly succeeded.
 
 MR. BLACK. know, certainly would help
 [analysis] sent little ahead time could reflect
 bit. That's lot digest short period time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Bob.
 
 MR. PARRY. somewhat narrower topic: agree, Mike,
 nondefense capital goods orders really good indicators far
 capital spending concerned. would better perhaps
 try take lumpiness aircraft parts opposed
 excluding it?
 important factor regard
 capital spending. know it's lumpy maybe averaged
 couple months you'd get better picture.
 MR. PRELL.
 don't think so, President Parry,
 think value indicator relatively short run. lags
 one measures relation orders shipments tend
 matter several months. case aircraft,
 current situation is, lead times long
 placing orders meaningful-MR. PARRY.
 
 it's lumpiness.
 
 MR. PRELL. That's apart fact lots
 intermediate goods there--parts [for example]--and lot
 goes exports.
 It's even bigger problem
 translating orders business fixed investment.
 So,
 there's great deal slack that.

 MR. JOHNSON. One last question:

 MR. PRELL. 1989 it's small part; dollar terms
 net exports improve $22 billion GNP improving $122 billion-that's roughly 1/2 percent GNP. 1990 net exports accounting
 roughly 3/4 1 percent growth.

 MR. STERN. Mike, regard slowing auto sales

 Well, 1989.
 
 MR. PRELL. crop year like 1988 [1989 or]
 1990, things equal, would subtract 0.7 percent

 think bigger
 concern--one don't know cope terms

 it's spotty, seems shortage soil moisture.

 MR. ANGELL.
 I'm wrong.
 
 I'm sorry, thought 4 percent maybe

 I'm splitting thinly; it's little

 MR. MELZER.
 forecast time falls within
 parameters central tendency, little unusual,
 think, us recent years.
 We're low end real GNP 21/2 percent high end CPI 5 percent.
 we're
 modestly higher terms unemployment end year.
 Looking 1990, forecast would quite similar
 we've seen Board's staff maybe somewhat stronger real
 growth--at 1-1/2 percent--and CPI continuing somewhere
 around 5 percent.
 So, declines.
 Looking beyond that, even
 though didn't projections, think we'd expect CPI begin
 coming down.
 big difference, however, forecast
 Board staff's forecast we've assumed Ml growth
 somewhere 3 5 percent area produce essentially
 similar results, whereas Board staff's forecast think Ml

 Based that,
 think I'd say view risk Board staff's

 versus arithmetic done 1990 get very,
 dramatic difference. economy that's growing
 somewhat stronger rate Greenbook, trade account
 current account adjustment process stopping
 reversing: trade deficit actually increases current
 account deficit actually increases. Now, approximate sense,
 arithmetic reasons that--I emphasize arithmetic opposed
 forecasting--are fundamentally due two things. foreign
 growth assumptions almost identical. relatively
 small difference exchange rate: real exchange rate
 unchanged whereas Ted, think, something like 8 percent real
 depreciation. that's really drives thing. big
 difference Ted's Mike's numbers 1990
 significant slowdown U.S. economy. look
 numbers versus numbers, it's exchange rate it's
 foreign growth really makes decisive difference terms
 whether external adjustment process continue least
 right algebraic sign 1990. raises even larger
 question, Tom Melzer touched bit made reference
 policy. question is: anything roughly resembling
 kind exchange rates either sets arithmetic,
 get material progress next several years
 external adjustment process without significant slowing rate
 growth domestic economy? can't,
 imply terms risks significant accident one kind

 context financing requirements; even Mike's Ted's combined

 Governor Angell already talked great length, makes

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. perspective similar Governor
 Heller's. I'm looking lot different things here. First,
 unit labor cost side, realize we've acceleration
 year; looking charts handout we're
 rate existed end 1986.
 deceleration 1987 fairly strong growth rate
 unit labor costs. don't think there's anything given
 acceleration unit labor costs. look pattern,
 fairly sawtoothed since 1984 chart; doesn't show
 sign particular direction. Compensation nonwage compensation don't know whether continue. Wages
 still pretty good shape, don't think there's
 accelerating trend wage front non-wage compensation doesn't
 continue accelerate.
 employment side, we've strong employment
 numbers. went back looked previous periods
 turning points. obvious one 1984 growth
 strong first half economy slipped 2-1/2
 percent 2 percent second half year.
 payroll employment growth averaging 300,000 way
 November, even hit turning point; I'm sure
 we're going get leading signals employment numbers.
 something else interesting: two-year period
 averaged 2-1/2 percent real growth average payroll
 employment 240,000 per month. Now, doesn't say whole
 lot productivity growth, admit; still, I'm sure
 read employment growth numbers.
 signs slowing see even looking
 charts. much slower pattern new orders, looking
 charts nondefense capital goods area; know
 excludes aircraft, that's volatile element we're assuming aside.
 Vender performance improving. Export growth slowed,
 thank heaven; slowed rapid pace, certainly
 slowed. Surveys plant equipment spending 1989 lower
 that's showing numbers; purchasing managers' reports
 certainly looks like things slowing. surveys
 
 -20-
 
 2/7-8/89
 
 outside forecasts made indicate they're similar
 Greenbook's, even little weaker. important
 thing assume lower interest rate patterns even
 here. certainly don't assume interest rate path
 built Greenbook. Bluechip forecast, sort
 consensus forecast, similar pattern growth inflation
 forecast actually funds rate declining later
 year. So, get similar path totally different set
 interest rate assumptions ours.
 people pointed financial indicators. Real
 M2 growth nominal M2 growth modest; real M2 growth
 even negative. yield curve inverted. Long bonds quite
 well behaved; long-bond rates well funds rate,
 especially coupon basis. certainly signs
 accelerating inflationary expectations financial markets
 commodity prices, bonds, dollar. One thing worries
 good bit, too, fact critical part Greenbook
 forecast dollar forecast. depreciation dollar,
 said, [accounts] three quarters percent growth rate
 1990 that's assuming 10 13 percent dollar
 depreciation. assumed spite fact we're
 assuming 1-1/2 percentage point appreciation short-term
 interest rates current levels. that, interest
 rate appreciation assume matched foreign interest rates.
 see way, relative interest rate appreciation
 United States compared countries, possibly

 dollar depreciation kind pattern interest rates.
 think turn dollar path around get totally different
 picture Greenbook forecast. pointed
 alternatives--if look one assumes change
 dollar, wouldn't even bet kind interest rate
 path built Greenbook--that don't accelerate
 money growth offset impact real sector get
 substantially weaker growth moderation inflation rate
 levels. That's scenario looks plausible
 one built there. would say, trying take
 account lags conscious
 possibilities, ought cautious them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, concern becoming

 economic mix. think major problems
 United States, indeed world, could severely

 want add couple points
 made Governors Heller Johnson along lines
 forecasts people outside seem somewhat different
 ours.
 purchasing managers' survey Bluechip forecast
 mentioned before. morning breakfast business
 economists representing wide range companies-forest
 products company, large energy company, two chemical companies,
 kinds outfits--and person don't see capacity

 also certainly

 declining housing-related construction, one-third
 models allocation compared well one-half early last year.
 allocated models large machines associated worldwide

 much idle capacity softer times.
 It's customary stretch
 delivery. says sales outside United States 33
 percent last year business beginning slow
 Europe.
 talks materials prices less
 PPI expects continue; suppliers asking
 bigger increases target less national inflation.
 Also, got something National Association Home
 Builders. forecast housing starts 800,000--a figure
 800,000 1989--and proportional decline multifamily
 versus single-family starts. assuming additional
 1/2 percentage point increase long rates, specifically mortgage
 rates. third thing haven't heard people mention
 impact restructuring.
 seems read General

 help labor shortage there; that's going throw 3,000
 people [the labor pool].

 Also, haven't heard anybody allude thrift mess impact

 profitable thrifts throwing pile. Also,
 reiterate, monetary growth numbers good; least read
 them, best since I've here. haven't
 able quantify impact higher interest rates monthly
 installment loan payments variable rate loans
 used, cannot imagine it's going take place.
 enough rise short rates many
 instruments tied would think [the rate adjustments]
 would start kicking effect would produce higher monthly
 payments. Maybe everyone signed one instruments
 monthly incomes advance fast; that's case, they're
 lucky. didn't, aren't represented
 negotiations. Perhaps cover
 higher payments loans cutting back something else. So,
 guess I'm convinced forecast

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. agree large parts several people
 said here. share skepticism regard dollar
 depreciate extent forecasted do, given
 kind interest rate scenario we've adopted.
 context one begins get worried whether continue
 make favorable progress external adjustments without
 trend dollar. agree Governor Johnson
 said, I'm little worried think
 lag regard prices wages we're beginning see

 inflationary pressures emerging wages prices

 So, would argue constraint argued here.
 hand, I'm concerned fact

 about; sounded kind like broken record

 I'm concerned zeal try reverse inflation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Let start thrift issue. First

 50 basis point increase rates roughly costs $1 billion

 translates roughly done terms giving

 take steps prevent inflation getting hand
 time goes because--and I'm sure staff done work
 this--you linear function costs thrifts
 rates rise. Also, many largest thrift institutions hedges

 experience region. feel risks quite
 asymmetric--that's New England pronunciation asymmetric,
 guess--but they're doubly asymmetric sense may get

 discussed tomorrow.
 far region goes, seeing softness,
 relatively, New England. contradict said before,
 think reason we're seeing softness
 really boom long period time. look
 Massachusetts example--and Massachusetts half New England-per capita income state 123 percent national
