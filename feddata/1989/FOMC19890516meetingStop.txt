 MR. CROSS.
 Well, it's easy give generalized

 No, focus intervention

 MR. CROSS. Well, sometimes Germans view

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Sam, mentioned one thing may

 guess one things bothers little

 question is: capital gains already there?
 already taking capital gains; would advantage
 would cause people rush bonds point?
 MR. CROSS. Well, think that's true. extent

 factors tending put upward
 pressure dollar. Recently, statistical reports come
 suggest economy may little less robust,
 hear people drawing conclusion makes long bond

 feel way acting that, may

 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 one question, please?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes.

 MR. GUFFEY. Yes, Mr. Chairman. may Sam

 last question is: calls shots this? Treasury
 believes intervention level appropriate?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Treasury legal lead
 decisions. discuss ultimate decisions
 theirs. think issue isn't much question much
 does. critical question you're asking, see it, is:
 think intervention make much difference
 various studies we've involved suggest otherwise?
 we're partly reflecting views G-7 finance ministers
 believe intervention economists central bankers
 do. underneath annoying concern
 dollar strengthening face current account imbalance.
 look issue one two ways: either 1)

 puzzlement markets moved strongly have.
 Certainly, move take lot explanation.
 don't see particularly surface stage. Sam,
 consistent judgment?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions, Sam,
 would mind reintroducing recommendation put
 form motion?
 MR. CROSS. recommend, respect recent activity,
 Committee approve operations since last meeting
 $1.4 billion equivalent worth sales dollars.
 would also like raise Committee point respect
 foreign currency authorization limit, present
 time. limit, public figure, provides
 System hold foreign currency balances total $12 billion
 equivalent. present nearly $11 billion equivalent.
 mentioned earlier, since Plaza agreement September 1985
 embarked practice active intervention role
 bought $14 billion sold $14 billion.
 value foreign currency balances period
 doubled $5-1/2 billion $11 billion. reasons
 doubled really three-fold. One, made profit
 sold dollar relatively high
 bought dollar relatively low. 40 percent
 increase value foreign currency holdings
 represents profits. second factor have, along
 Treasury, bought yen--not intervention operations
 direct transactions Japanese
 Ministry Finance bodies. That, too, added 40
 percent increase value foreign currency
 balances. third factor balances invested
 
 5/16/89
 
 continue earn interest them; remaining roughly 20
 percent represents earnings balances. So,
 getting much closer authorized limit $12 billion.
 would like propose Committee raise authorized limit
 $12 billion $15 billion order provide headroom
 circumstances value foreign currency
 balances increases room accommodate within
 authorized limit.
 recommendation, Mr. Chairman,
 Committee raise limit Foreign Currency Authorization
 $12 billion $15 billion.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Mr. Chairman, would--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 don't want motion.
 
 going make motion; maybe
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Hold questions this.
 
 Well, yet.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's two separate motions.
 Let's first motion ratify transactions since last
 meeting.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 move.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 discussion level issue.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Let's motion
 
 move it, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. discussion this?
 MR. FORRESTAL. balances basically yen
 distributed evenly?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 No, much heavily marks.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 Marks.
 
 don't many yen present time.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, seems issue
 dogmatic views really aren't helpful.
 seems we're
 going deal questions matter practicality.
 working Administration, I'm somewhat pleased
 Administration that's willing kind exchange rate
 intervention versus one says absolutely not.
 Sam, would like
 little better accounting--that is, believe purposes
 ought keep track opportunity costs balances
 
 5/16/89
 
 consider entire gain sense blue,
 would earnings U.S. Treasury balances.
 correct?
 MR. CROSS(?).
 
 Yes sir.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. ANGELL. So, seems opportunity costs
 subtracted out. Now, would say believe--as
 know vote last June--that exchange rate intervention
 ought never go cross purposes monetary policy. think
 it's always mistake we're going demonstrate
 ineffectiveness one camp time that.
 seems merit going forward move
 necessary adjustments monetary aggregate
 growth rates take place. would mean, then,
 deutschemark interest rates would tend move relative
 relative opportunity cost seems unusually high.
 So, support proposal.
 MR. BOEHNE. question comment.
 view follows: going play game need
 ammunition way storing ammunition. we're
 going go $12 billion $15 billion, increase $3
 billion enough? Would make sense go $18 billion another
 ask I'm sensitive enough know
 number?
 read increasing limit $12 $15 billion. So,
 we're going raise limit might raise enough
 last while? think $3 billion last
 doesn't make difference whether raise twice
 whatever?
 MR. CROSS. Well, doubt controversial
 newsworthy issue; don't know. matter report
 don't believe gained much attention past. proposed
 $3 billion increase grounds would provide
 reasonable comfort circumstances arose something
 needed would reconsider question.
 Committee proposes higher figure, that's fine me.
 MR. TRUMAN. last time Louvre
 Accord; raised $3-1/2 billion had, fact, less
 leeway today. want look
 perspective gives quite lot leeway [unintelligible] giving
 [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee opportunity revisit
 issue time-to-time.
 MR. CROSS. becomes effective one side
 intervention: we're selling dollars, we're selling any.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Unless go debt.
 
 MR. CROSS. Yes. must say value
 marbles play we're going game.
 think level reserves have, compared almost
 anything, really modest. think $3 billion
 
 5/16/89
 
 proposed would adequate; [the Committee preferred]
 would quite happy see that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 Well, also send message
 
 Treasury.
 MR. SYRON. message--which would given both,
 think--is lot us skepticism value

 proposal $3 billion makes lot sense: [it requires] coming
 back Committee rather large increase,
 possibly could interpreted people--even though may
 pay much attention it--as saying change
 fundamental approach that's taken.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. Thank you. First all, think good
 time us accumulate reserves. not--well, don't want
 speak what's going happen later today--but certainly
 wouldn't think ready ease major fashion
 present time. Neither Germans Japanese ready
 tighten. policy moves would counterproductive far

 wondered feel differently market's

 MR. PRELL. Well, think diversity

 stay bit higher.
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes. follow-up that, think maybe
 you're little less concerned slowing relative

 MR. JOHNSON. think know answer would be,

 let's assume economy running forecast.
 seems additional 75 basis points funds

 recession category. Now, don't know think,
 seems like would clearly tip economy over; maybe wouldn't.
 MR. PRELL. We're close recession forecast

 matter.
 I'm simply suggesting data

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. interest rate scenario would be,
 think, somewhat tougher follow.

 MR. KELLEY. Governor Johnson covered exactly points

 He's good mind reader.
 
 President
 
 Stern.
 MR. STERN. here--a increase
 interest rates 65 75 basis points late year
 something?
 MR. PRELL. put federal funds rate end
 year approaching 10-3/4 percent level.
 MR. HELLER. Mike, say?
 end year--
 
 didn't hear you.
 

 
 MR. PRELL. said federal funds rate somewhere

 Kansas, example, large red
 winter wheat producer, latest estimates production
 200 million bushels that's 325 million
 year before. That's latest official forecast. However,
 talking producers grain people
 throughout Kansas, projection get
 measurable rain next couple weeks would happy
 150 180 million bushels. interesting aspect
 that, given drought conditions high plains areas
 producing red winter wheat--basically Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming
 Oklahoma--the total production would 8 percent.
 look wheat totally, includes spring wheat, total
 wheat production would 13 percent. rest
 small grains: corn, example, 60 percent last
 year; beans 27 percent; oats 100 percent.
 projecting strong farm production year given,
 course, drought doesn't affect measurably. So,
 agricultural sector things looking pretty good.
 mean, however, spots Kansas won't feel impact
 drought; nation whole probably not. matter
 fact, given projections, would see modest increases
 food costs, unlike think staff projected--about
 3-1/4 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. crop estimators time

 hunch sustained
 without tightening.
 District perspective, though, moderation
 we're seeing nationally quite apparent.
 Many
 industries District pretty well--indeed, well.
 auto industry mini exception it's dramatic
 change. reducing forecast year; commonly,
 sales forecast cars 10 million trucks 5.1 million.
 Inventories dealers high first time
 years dealers beginning resist delivery new units.
 Therefore, production probably going come down. secondquarter number looks reduction 3 percent.

 production risk autos clearly side,

 overtime; therefore, reduction production result
 layoffs. sales level of, say, 10 million cars 5.1
 million trucks maintained incentives
 they're running. hear it, incentives richest
 ever offered since initiated programs.
 result this, steel business, least District,
 expected down--not anything significant certainly
 last year, very, heavy. parts District
 well. demand industrial machinery high;
 chemical products demand continues high; construction activity,

 indicators throughout District

 manufacturing, employment growth also
 slowed. Construction activity may slowing District

 MR. MELZER.

 based 4 percent money growth. We've become increasingly
 concerned that, virtually M1 growth since July last year,
 risks recession either later year early next year

 Manley described before: many private forecasters use
 interest rate-driven models really interest rate scenario
 rates coming latter part year achieve soft
 landing that's Board staff's forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. First all, think New England economy,

 manufacturers reasonable backlogs say new orders
 many cases don't look good, particularly defense
 computer areas tend defense-dependent.
 One reason
 asked Mike question earlier inventories
 manufacturers aerospace business--particularly
 business supplying parts jet engine manufacturers--say that,
 given backlogs understand manufacturers have,
 seeing much orders earlier. large jet
 engine manufacturers, particularly General Electric Pratt
 Whitney, seem going just-in-time types inventory
 practices.
 So, say, think things reflect
 earlier excesses, deterioration competitive position. Bob
 [Forrestal] mentioned expansion Southeast firms based
 Northeast.
 firms decided
 expand [in region]; generally, close plant

 factors.
 far national economy goes, view similar
 contained Greenbook. sympathy
 people said, I'm inclined think
 slowing going would thought month ago.
 find
 somewhat heartening we're seeing really consistent
 Greenbook forecast we'd expect, given rise
 we've seen rates thus far. Looking employment numbers,
 last month's number little low wasn't enormously
 one might think sustainable rate growth employment,
 especially one looks strike-adjusted data. Given
 labor market right now, think Bob Parry's remarks
 don't know great deal details,
 score apt.
 we're somewhat concerned we're seeing Bethlehem
 Steel settlement, though might taken care time
 competitive factors USX something. think developments
 labor markets still indicate inflationary pressures
 built take work out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 5/16/89
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, encouraged
 recent business statistics recent business developments
 suggest kind adjustment thought needed.
 It's
 also true that, broadly speaking, statistics anecdotal
 comments get business people less compatible
 other, isn't always case. one exception
 may bit concern anecdotal side near-term
 inflationary prospects.
 like Ed Boehne, look
 profile next six seven quarters, ways conclude
 indeed good one could hope for.
 question risks, I'm still impressed balance resiliency
 economy. Far often surprises tend
 plus side rather negative side. guess that's
 would hedge bets.
 said outlook Mike's forecast ways
 good one hope for, think it's worthwhile
 ask: leave us? look like
 end 1990--keeping mind point estimates
 worth darn?
 Nevertheless, end 1990?
 Well,
 even Mike's forecast underlying inflation rate still 5
 percent, maybe shade higher. external situation terrible.
 staff forecast current account deficit fourth

 expect easing rates may move much. data

 Certainly, technical aberrations may add somewhat;

 Again, I'm hung borrowing number whatsoever.
