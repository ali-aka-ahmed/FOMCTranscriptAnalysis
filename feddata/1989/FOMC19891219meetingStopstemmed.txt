 mr. slifman. well, exhibit 10 chart lower

 well, think that's fair statement.
 
 mr. hoskin. ye. again, think staff good job

 also compliment last statement think
 that's absolut accur. poor tool best
 them. sever comment alreadi made,
 agre with. think manlei try get idea,
 share content, [unintellig] 1980 exampl
 sure must upper limit sacrific ratio, want

 now, i'm also struck [polici prescript]
 milton friedman jame tobin late 1970s earli 1980s
 [impli a] horrend cost keep inflat long
 period time. again, overli critic kind
 exercis, think staff 1983 ran roughli kind
 experi board. look back exercis
 found substanti overestim cost--at least look
 like now--of get inflat down. so, think run
 risk seem err least on side exercis-unless bought full credibl model, case we'd
 probabl run risk er side it. said
 that, on observ i'd make, think governor angel
 get at, measur cost reduc inflat.
 on try make decis whether it's
 worthwhil do, on need measur benefit zero
 rate inflat--that is, next 5 year 10 year--and
 compar cost transit, mani us
 believ gain maintain price stabil term

 final, coupl specif question i'll
 rattl off: 1) intern investor lose confid
 dollar we've stabil it? 2) i'd like explain

 guess wayn alreadi made point, oil
 price; would concur observ price stabil
 
 12/18-19/89
 
 case you're much like oil price real term perhap
 declin rather rise.
 mr. hooper. well, let address question
 willing [to hold] dollar asset exchang disinfl.
 clearli, rise real interest rate would favor
 dollar; case, current account deficit persist
 [grow]--we're 1/2 percent gnp it's widen

 it's on reason consid two clearli mark

 couldn't rule distinct possibl movement

 second question on-to stabil [unintellig].
 mr. hoskin. real interest rate relat

 mr. prell. well, know there's reign opinion thi.
 clearli, becom much fashion recent year take

 mr. hooper. question oil price: ye, clearli,

 mr. boykin.
 
 mr. boykin. mr. chairman, wayn angel lee hoskin
 pretti well ask question i'd like ask slightli
 differ. i'm look exhibit 8. look four
 chart there: gnp deflat zero 1995;
 unemploy rate 1995 7 percent line head down;
 real gnp potenti growth; interest rate
 come down. us assumpt behind thi, seem
 would happen would favor
 pictur. question then, cours, is: happen 1995?
 know haven't done work. point know
 whether would expect continu decreas rate
 unemploy, continu growth gnp potenti rate,
 interest rate possibl come littl could
 reach point 1995?
 mr. slifman. well, it's much matter
 would expect; it's realli question polici action would
 taken point. expect polici action would
 taken point would eas monetari polici bring
 real interest rate wai try continu support
 real gnp bring unemploy rate closer natur
 rate. so, point i'm try make end

 substanti natur rate. [pose] continu
 strateg problem becaus, unemploy rate

 time. that's realli point try make.
 mr. boykin. well, guess would alwai assum, mayb
 erron, cours would make right polici decis.
 unemploy rate hold steadi 3 4 year
 downward slope line, wonder whether could
 expect continu.
 mr. slifman. well, downward slope--and mayb it's

 percent 7.0 percent. it's-mr. boykin.
 mr. slifman.
