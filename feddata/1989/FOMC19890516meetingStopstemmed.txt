 mr. angel. mr. chairman, seem issu
 dogmat view realli aren't help.
 seem we're
 go deal question matter practic.
 work administr, i'm somewhat pleas
 administr that's will kind exchang rate
 intervent versu on sai absolut not.
 sam, would like
 littl better account--that is, believ purpos
 ought keep track opportun cost balanc
 
 5/16/89
 
 consid entir gain sens blue,

 correct?
 mr. cross(?).
 
 ye sir.
 
 vice chairman corrigan.
 
 ye.
 
 mr. angel. so, seem opportun cost
 subtract out. now, would sai believ--as
 know vote last june--that exchang rate intervent
 ought never go cross purpos monetari polici. think
 it's alwai mistak we're go demonstr
 ineffect on camp time that.
 seem merit go forward move
 necessari adjust monetari aggreg
 growth rate take place. would mean, then,
 deutschemark interest rate would tend move rel
 rel opportun cost seem unusu high.
 so, support propos.
 mr. boehn. question comment.
 view follow: go plai game need
 ammunit wai store ammunit. we're
 go go $12 billion $15 billion, increas $3
 billion enough? would make sens go $18 billion anoth
 ask i'm sensit enough know
 number?
 read increas limit $12 $15 billion. so,
 we're go rais limit might rais enough
 last while? think $3 billion last
 doesn't make differ whether rais twice
 whatev?
 mr. cross. well, doubt controversi
 newsworthi issu; don't know. matter report
 don't believ gain much attent past. propos
 $3 billion increas ground would provid
 reason comfort circumst aros someth
 need would reconsid question.
 committe propos higher figur, that's fine me.
 mr. truman. last time louvr
 accord; rais $3-1/2 billion had, fact, less
 leewai todai. want look
 perspect give quit lot leewai [unintellig] give
 [foreign currenc] subcommitte opportun revisit

 mr. cross. becom effect on side
 intervent: we're sell dollar, we're sell ani.
 mr. truman.
 
 unless go debt.
 
 mr. cross. ye. must sai valu
 marbl plai we're go game.
 think level reserv have, compar almost
 anyth, realli modest. think $3 billion
 
 5/16/89
 
 propos would adequ; [the committe prefer]
 would quit happi see that.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 $5 billion,
 
 presid hoskin, governor heller.
 
 mr. hoskin.
 risk dogmat, reason
 we--or least chairman--discuss go along
 counterpart abroad. also discuss evid
 larg open economi intervent effect tool.

 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor heller.
 
 mr. heller. thank you. first all, think good
 time us accumul reserv. not--well, don't want
 speak what's go happen later todai--but certainli
 wouldn't think readi eas major fashion
 present time. neither german japanes readi
 tighten. polici move would counterproduct far
 help intern adjust process concern,
 still major problem confront world economi. so,
 basic principl on shouldn't undo right hand

 howev, certainli support chairman's view symmetr

 mean realli mean symmetri? basic support
 "b."
 again, i'm hung borrow number whatsoev.
 would defin "b" 6-3/4 percent fund rate--i mean 9-3/4; hope
 that's freudian slip--a 9-3/4 percent fund rate would
 like clearli focus center rather
 let edg toward upper end that. concern
 neutral issu; bill rate short-term interest
 rate stai intermeet period don't show tendenc
 bounc back toward fund rate, certainli would think
 try remain neutral would impli bring fund rate
 line rate. would like think symmetr languag
 would mean chairman would discret
 intermeet period make adjust there. certainli think
 fit symmetr neutral polici.
 purpos list posit would be: "b;" 6-3/4--rather 9-3/4
