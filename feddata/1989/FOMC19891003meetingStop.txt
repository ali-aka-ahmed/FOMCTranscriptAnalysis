 October 3, 1989
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone.

 MS.
 
 SEGER.
 
 I'll move it.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. CROSS.
 MR. BLACK.

 MR. CROSS.
 
 Would somebody

 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Cross?
 
 MR. HOSKINS. relative ceiling [on
 holdings foreign currencies]? anticipate
 intermeeting period ahead terms raising [$20
 billion] ceiling?
 MR. CROSS. $1-1/2 billion
 ceiling. Whether going prove necessary request
 change depends much things develop months
 ahead. $1-1/2 billion which, share 50/50
 Treasury, means could substantial amount
 intervention--$3 billion worth--before would come
 ceiling.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Sam, couple things
 thought didn't come quite clearly report.
 First
 all, G-7 Communique said looked like dollar line
 certainly disagree that,
 existing fundamentals.
 guess one could debate point. Communique also said,
 specifically follow-up language, G-7 would consider
 counterproductive dollar rose current levels fell
 sharply.
 terms exchange rate strategy, understanding
 certainly implication concerted
 attack dollar. mentioned strategy generally
 resist upward pressure, times repeatedly
 concerted effort drive dollar lower then,
 ratcheted down, hammer even started show upward
 pressure lower levels.
 So, think it's bit semantic
 issue talk resisting upward pressure fact
 clear strategy ratchet dollar. Even though
 massive levels dollars sold, kind strategy--especially
 we've never participated Far Eastern markets regular basis--in
 opinion grossly destabilizing.
 thought scary
 event, can't see us condoning sort strategy.
 think
 it's potentially very, dangerous.
 
 10/3/89
 
 MR. CROSS. Well, words Communique exactly
 said exactly read statement--that

 rise excessive decline could adversely affect prospects.
 would say, though, very, major difference
 going hammering dollar falling markets
 resisting rising. didn't always resist
 immediately showed increase; resisted
 rising let market take some. Obviously, market

 knew G-7 trying guide dollar some.
 point making recognize try take account
 of, much could, risks could follow really
 go hammer dollar falling, didn't
 really do.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, let ask question. kind
 technical agreement within G-7 targeted band exchange
 I'm certainly aware any. is,
 rates now?
 specifically?
 MR. CROSS.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 far I'm aware, none.
 quantitative understanding
 
 ranges?
 MR. CROSS.
 aware target ranges
 existence. months months ago, don't think
 relevance present time.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Well then, know
 
 going?
 MR. CROSS.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Well, talking every day-What objective?
 
 MR. CROSS. objective curb dollar's rise
 decline some. want fall enormous-MR. JOHNSON.
 
 where?
 
 MR. CROSS. discuss every day following
 day.
 fallen little time time; fall
 massive amounts day. discussed others, based
 closing level New York, say, Tuesday, might
 sensible target.
 MR. JOHNSON. put position somebody
 market concluded Communique meant
 market.
 G-7 wanted lower dollar, [not as]
 resisting [a rise] current levels. they're trying figure
 fundamentals are; target goes along
 sounds like even don't know.
 fundamentals?
 even understanding dollar ought be.
 MR. CROSS. understanding rise
 occurred helpful. effort bring
 greater stability reduce dollar somewhat. one knows
 need move dollar XYZ point order assure
 
 10/3/89
 
 meets longer-term [fundamentals].

 intention, far I'm concerned, try take away
 upward momentum let ease somewhat. But, say,
 hasn't fallen much haven't driven
 much. We're levels saw August--that's less two
 months ago--and saw earlier May. I'm sure
 dollar show significant rise approach would
 change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let answer, Governor Johnson.
 best way defining involved range
 dollar, much various governments would willing
 commit.
 think best way describing agreement
 would moderate intervention intervention knocked
 dollar significantly, did, fine.
 not, agreement use unlimited resources
 break market. original proposal shot
 down. sense, rather talk terms
 ultimate goal, think appropriate issue
 restraints guidelines degree
 resources placed markets.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, since notion
 dollar commitment dollars, would
 happened dollar collapsed yet you'd spent
 third commitment?
 MR. CROSS.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 would stopped.
 would keep spending it?
 No.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 stop?
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 stop?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's various meetings
 central banks involved insisted upon looking
 going secondary markets--so evidence
 cumulative deterioration would induced real pull back.
 really wasn't country versus country. finance ministers
 central bank governors.
 you're trouble finding
 ranges policy is, [that because] you're
 looking committee.
 tried get consistent day-by-day
 scenario, Ted Truman put it, many branches
 possibilities. went day-by-day, restraint
 criterion amount resources available,
 particular target.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, that's case, think it's even
 dangerous thought first started
 conversation. spent $400 million intervened five times
 market yesterday dollar around 139 yen
 1.87 D-mark, yet don't know we're going.
 MR. CROSS.
 entered almost
 dollar moved 139.
 
 10/3/89
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Well, fraction.
 
 MR. CROSS. knew points particularly
 sensitive market dollar got close 140 [yen]
 went order try keep going 140
 level. didn't enough keep going through.
 MR. JOHNSON. Hearing description, think there's
 risk risk premiums going continue grow. much
 uncertainty here, imagine uncertainty
 might market can't even figure what's going
 on.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's quite fair.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 [Laughter].
 Governor Johnson!
 
 You're shooting messenger here,
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, realize resistance lot
 [intervention] strategy [among Committee members],
 think ought step resistance.
 MR. BOEHNE. I'd like pursue conversation along
 market saw kind
 somewhat different line.
 intervention--and dollar come down--one reasons might
 think would come governments going spend
 second act
 kind money, must second act.
 So,
 might understanding basic policy changes.
 first question is: discussions intervention,
 kind understanding intervention followed
 fundamental changes economic policy, whether
 monetary side fiscal side?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 answer "no."
 
 market thinks so.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 think market would think so,
 people probably would agree intervention, except rare
 situations, rather temporary influence unless followed
 something fundamental.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ed, true among academicians;
 belief now,
 true among finance ministers.
 particularly among Japanese, sterilized intervention put
 exchange rate want it.
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, leads next question; think

 Vice Chairman Corrigan.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. couple points: first all,
 there's absolutely question perception--whether it's reality
 not--that central bank trying beat dollar
 very, dangerous thing; would agree that. may
 agreed perhaps understood amount effort
 gone trying minimize kinds problems could
 arise current circumstances Treasury
 elsewhere. Maybe hasn't pristine pure perfect

 But, again, real question one Ed Boehne started ask

 there. central banks continue participate kind

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 side of.
 MR. BLACK. Well, going commend

 Treasury's primary status thing.
 would express hope study undertaken could
 convince really don't know much it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One things intend

 10/3/89
 
 MR. BLACK. said, knew side
 angels! Others may argue, Wayne close contact
 angels says exactly right! there's anyone
 who's equipped speak angels think really is.
 MR. GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Well, won't go back objections
 whole policy I've done before. So, let start
 someplace else, room seems
 concerns whether we're going hanging together
 terms making decisions road. spring
 dissent went $15 billion. went $18 billion
 guess we're $20 billion. seems two dissents
 last go-around. So, think issue one could
 divide Committee it's right issue fighting
 over. right issue fighting price stability;
 think people room agree that. So, question
 you--and hope convey feelings Treasury
 that's really sticking point think it's important
 good relations Committee Japanese,
 would cut way--how far willing go spending
 resources along line?
 I'm sorry it's far me;
 apparently we're picking limit. may go think
 would bad Committee--you'll get bigger bigger
 splits.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, seems pretty well
 agreed efforts [discourage] intervention. would say
 one factor [use] make
 viewpoint known best Administration. concern
 something confrontational nature
 would forced required things wouldn't want do.
 don't understand. back away, Manley, don't know-MR. JOHNSON. Let say, Bob, that's case,
 think we're going silly exercise approving limits.
 What's FOMC meeting issue for? even care
 it? Let's turn open market operations foreign exchange
 Treasury. going silly exercise
 don't something say it?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 point do.
 
 just--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, that's fair. basically
 something say; maybe we've got 40 percent they've got 60
 percent, it's zero.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, account acquire
 exchange reserves supposed authority
 account. Bob Black said, certainly responsibility
 serve agent Treasury actions foreign exchange.
 last thing would want question authority.
 certainly instruct us account; would
 
 10/3/89
 
 never resist that.
 acquiring exchange reserves account
 totally opposed direction policy takes
 implicates us policy, think. Now, I'm confrontation
 either. matter fact, consider simmering
 long time issue I've generally approving
 things along Subcommittee level higher FOMC
 level.
 never felt dealing disorderly conditions
 resisting pressures one direction another something worth
 fighting over.
 worth cooperating maintaining whole
 atmosphere coordination cooperation. perceive
 we're getting point literally taking risks
 moving direction counter whole philosophy, seems
 we've got stand counted here. whole thing
 runs risk implicating us something
 saying standing price stability. Now, think
 debate fast want go toward goal; it's
 going take even longer participate kinds
 activities. think point give
 clear message point view this. Continuing
 acquire exchange reserves exposure account really
 risky, especially given know people running
 things Treasury.
 don't think it's Nick Brady myself.

 think green-eyeshade person David Mulford
 doesn't know he's doing. think it's risky turn
 policy somebody like that.
 think Secretary Brady capable
 brought around issue maybe that's [we
 go]; know Chairman effective talking
 before.
 wouldn't making points wasn't worried.

 think strategy pursuing risky makes us
 look bad.

 Governor

 MR. JOHNSON. mentioned expect stimulus

 Earlier, previous FOMC meetings, said declines

 MR. PRELL. don't think expect see dramatic

 It's true orders trend, suggested,
 especially strong late. start dissecting data

 acceleration; deceleration forecast.
 MR. JOHNSON. Okay, agree that, think.
 you're saying, though, decline long-term interest
 rates hasn't stimulative effect this.
 MR. PRELL. don't think large effect, no.
 haven't large enough change interest rate levels greatly
 alter businessmen's assessment profitability investment

 bit, hasn't dramatic means. lot

 volatile number. single-family starts August also
 shade weak side. think happening, though,
 see pickup housing demand manifested existing home

 expecting modest boost overall economic activity near

 MR. JOHNSON. want follow one last thing
 talking yesterday Board room discussing
 [unintelligible] still want try understand this.
 indicated beginning presentation need
 slack get inflation economy. I'm still
 trying understand conceptually works degree.
 monetary policy maintains nominal demand potential output
 full employment unemployment rate--say maintained nominal demand
 consistent potential output growth--is need slack
 rigidities system? adjustment process cause
 get inflation mix real mix temporarily?
 MR. PRELL. think that's case. super
 rational people perceive sudden monetary policy
 track going hold nominal aggregate demand expansion
 line trend rate real output growth, expectations
 would change wage bargaining would revolve around kind
 expectation. could instantaneous downward adjustment
 rate inflation without significant cost real output.
 course, contracts impediments even
 expectations adjusted dramatically-MR. JOHNSON. Okay. want understand you're saying,
 though. even bring nominal demand line
 potential output, actual output slow relative
 potential contracts [and other] rigidities
 system? Okay, that's the-MR. PRELL. think you'd hard task bring nominal
 aggregate demand expansion immediately noninflationary
 level. can't envision happening without enormous jolt
 system.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Yes, well can't either.
 
 I'm still trying
 
 get--
 
 MR. PRELL. inflexibility form
 contracts absolute credibility--if could
 announce today pulling track everyone
 believed you--then presumably everything would flow real
 effects would minimal.
 MR. JOHNSON. Everybody understands nominal

 gradually line potential output maintained there,
 guess would little trouble understanding would
 necessarily inflationary experience.
 MR. PRELL. Well, think put finger
 appropriate facets system impede kind
 frictionless movement toward lower inflation.
 MR. JOHNSON. say, lower nominal demand-just lower it, even it's currently potential output--why
 doesn't lead slowing inflation rate even though
 real economy might slowing still performing relative
 potential?
 MR. PRELL. point feel economy is, sense,
 overemployed. kind situation competition resources
 tends put upward pressure wages prices.

 develop bit slack, think that's direction
 things going tend drift. We've generous, sense,
 relative models would tell us.
 really taken
 hard view we're natural rate
 tremendous acceleration forces here. rather modest
 acceleration forecast. historical evidence
 reasonably compelling short run kind
 trade-off don't get frictional movement lower inflation
 rates without output loss.
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, think historical record show
 reduce nominal demand mixed effect--that
 get little both.
 MR. PRELL.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Right, precisely.
 flexible markets are, better
 
 mix.
 MR. PRELL. Well, that's reasonably
 optimistic.
 think perhaps greater flexibility.
 think also residuum fear loss
 employment forth may existed earlier years,
 workers aware turmoil '80s
 exposure international trade,
 MR. JOHNSON. I'm saying that, given that, it's
 still clear economy can't grow around potential
 rate you're restraining demand even though mix
 [unintelligible].
 think that's central debate.
 MR. PRELL. Sure.
 something feel know
 absolutely. we're hard pressed explain
 observing without sense that, economy got tighter,
 exerted inflationary pressure. could play games
 guessing inflation expectations various times
 last several years make consistent pressures
 labor market terms unemployment rate level
 substantial explanatory factor. looks us that, got
 5 6 percent unemployment rate range,
 pressure wages prices.
 
 10/3/89
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 don't disagree.
 

 MR. PRELL. question is: unwind that?
 could bring sudden powerful expectational change,
 might help minimize need loss output order
 move inflation rate back down. otherwise think
 going frictional costs here.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY.
 I'd like ask two questions related

 deterioration, tendency [for activity] come toward

 particularly true heavy manufacturing part economy.
 example: orders large trucks, Class trucks, slowed

 Offsetting this, construction activity District continues
 pretty strong, stronger national numbers. Certainly,
 automotive sector difficult read.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. can't worry we're going two
 years don't think us forecast even two quarters
 ahead let alone two years ahead. Looking couple quarters ahead,
 though, think slowing seen going
 continue. concerns greatly weakness see
 various manufacturing areas. weakness manufacturing,
 think, serious overall weakness. Purchasing
 Managers' Survey last five months indicated
 slowing; sources information well. repeat
 couple things Si Keehn said auto industry: using
 current production schedules fourth quarter
 weakest fourth quarter since 1982 may remember 1982
 exactly hot year autos. Even pick
 transplants which, course, become big important
 last seven years, still slowest fourthquarter production since 1982. Frankly, one reasons two
 three auto manufacturers announced incentives
 1990 models even readily available
 nervous weak demand. cases, enough
 orders even start plants running produce 1990 models.
 So, think people looked August auto sales numbers
 read sign strength got wrong message. end-ofyear close-outs really pushed. It's 180
 [degrees] away strong story; it's weak story.
 Also, interest rates actually perform Greenbook
 assumes--if short-term rates basically flat year ahead
 long rates rise slightly--I'd hard pressed expect
 housing improve. Maybe I'm missing something maybe consumers
 interested buying more, builders--at least
 builders' survey read--are feeling rather negative. That's
 particularly true parts country alluded
