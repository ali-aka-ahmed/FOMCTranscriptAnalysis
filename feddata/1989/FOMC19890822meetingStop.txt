 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Cross?
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Sam, particular pressure
 Japanese Germans anything terms monetary
 policy relieve pressure dollar?
 MR. CROSS.
 
 No, you're speaking of--
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, it's general question.
 wondered agitating and--
 

 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. haven't heard anything them.
 fact, remarkable quiescence lack usual
 discussions. Things quiet I've seen long time.
 Jerry, sensed anything?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 No.
 
 Thank you.
 Europe vacation.
 Like Washington.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Sam, I'd like get personal view
 concerning two scenarios regard exchange value
 dollar. next six months, U.S. interest rates remain
 largely now, would happen? Alternatively,
 would happen somewhat substantial decline of, say, 100
 basis points next six months?
 MR. CROSS.
 Well, course, exchange market
 influenced vast number factors addition interest rates.
 would differ statements Bluebook
 presented, suggest higher interest rates
 would tend add pressure dollar. many,
 many factors involved.
 depends, course,
 things going countries.
 last several months,
 we've seen fairly substantial changes interest rate
 differentials United States major
 countries.
 taken away structure-MR. ANGELL. don't quite understand answer
 comparison report said. report seemed indicate
 July August seemed quite difference
 perception direction U.S. interest rates might go.
 Now,
 don't think would significant next six months

 MR. CROSS.
 certainly factor period,
 pressures dollar change time
 
 8/22/89
 
 seemed change market's perception U.S.
 monetary policy. think said many,
 many factors involved also going affect
 pressures.
 don't think simply matter interest rates.
 MR. ANGELL. No, don't know anyone thinks it's
 simply interest rates.
 MR. CROSS. I'm saying past several
 months seen narrowing interest differentials--it
 couple hundred basis points--and continued
 pressure dollar despite that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 think lot would depend upon
 market thought interest rates going down. take two
 contrasting possibilities: market really thought
 underlying rate inflation coming down, interest rates
 coming response that, would one thing.
 hand, market felt economy ready fall
 bed interest rates coming that, think you'd
 get quite different [slide].
 really depend much
 perceptions why.
 MR. ANGELL. interested constant interest
 rate scenario falling interest rate scenario. Thank
 you.
 MR. CROSS. Well, present time, market
 [unintelligible] continues reasonably bullish dollar;
 [investors] see dollar good place be.
 compare
 dollar [alternatives] and, say, there's relative
 stability politically economically compared Japan
 elsewhere.
 Throughout year tendency
 [investors] looking long term see dollar good place
 be. reassessment shifting
 portfolios tendency greater share dollar
 investments less concern hedging it.
 So,
 sense think market pretty bullish dollar
 continues be.
 MR. ANGELL.

 words,
 marketplace
 would tend
 
 Okay, that's response looking
 think perception
 would interest rate declines,
 somewhat bullish dollar.
 
 MR. CROSS. Well, that's quite saying. Given
 everything that's going on--and interest rates--I think
 firmness strong support dollar.

 question Mexican swap drawing.
 MR. TRUMAN. Mr. Chairman, circulated memo, hope
 self explanatory, relating provision certain amount

 It's total amount $2

 Yes.

 fell apart meantime, next Committee

 [go record].
 
 MR. GUFFEY. ask vote it's submitted

 MR. TRUMAN. That's right. I've told authorities
 that's reasonable procedure follow.
 MR. GUFFEY.

 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Legal--that is, General Counsel.
 
 MR. CROSS.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Legal.
 Well, offends sensibilities.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. don't understand need make
 change procedure we-MR. TRUMAN. done before. used

 Mexico; weren't sure conditions would need
 arrangement. want way, approve

 don't strong [view a] way it. done
 way past, that's proposed arrangement.
 
 8/22/89
 
 MR. GUFFEY.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. GREENSPAN. think there's certain advantage
 way Ted suggesting. Even put vote record,
 sense, effectively implementing swap
 point view; falls apart, we're sort hanging
 with--to use analogy--half bridge.
 think authorizing
 delegating final approval Chairman leaves us
 position where, term sheet fail something like that,
 never implemented final action

 It's really
 cosmetic request.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, Mr. Chairman would possible

 I'm
 saying vote would take morning would

 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Fine.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. action would two-stage
 action: authorization Committee granting Chairman

 Thank you, Mr. Sternlight.
 
 Questions
 
 MR. MELZER. Peter, need drain reserves
 end?
 words, soon would expect that?
 Generally,
 funds trading little 9 percent. would
 expect trade 9 percent above? market
 participants discounted?
 Normally, expect funds rate
 soft need drain.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. contributing factor.
 basis reserve outlook, we're near end--at least
 latest projections I've seen, yesterday
 nearly done prospective draining period.
 There's small draining job roughly half billion
 next reserve period, unless things change Mexican
 developments foreign exchange developments. things,
 factors also, could change reserve outlook.
 market people, two camps thought funds
 
 8/22/89
 
 rate. expect see funds right around 9 percent give take
 small margin; others would thinking 9 9-1/8 percent.
 don't think there's much expectation imminently Fed
 wanting see funds rate pushed noticeably 8-3/4
 percent something like that. see something could
 come road, immediate future.
 must say little question mind currently, we've
 question right along, gauging proper relationship
 borrowings funds rates now. It's hard make strong case
 things, event. slight doubt moment
 whether, $550 million borrowing, really
 expecting funds 9 percent shade right around
 9 percent maybe even hair under. lot depends
 happens seasonal borrowing, stayed pretty high;
 come little still pretty darn high.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MR. HOSKINS. one, Peter, size
 Treasury balances. [implementing] drain comes cause
 ambiguity size easing move marketplace?
 discussions Treasury perhaps changing
 variability debt issues opposed balances
 Fed? really problem you?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. don't think particular
 problem. high balances end June;
 less forced high balances big seasonal
 tax receipts. used capacity
 banks hold note balances; capacity around $31 $32
 billion, recall. balances come July.
 holding pretty well around normal Fed balance $5
 billion working balance recently.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 That's really problem?
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 really great problem.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, think Lee raising question,
 assume, capability of-MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Issuing debt.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. --funding directly cash
 accounts borrowing new money. issue, gather,
 variable borrowing new money smooth tax
 loan account balances us?
 think answer that,
 far monetary policy concerned, assume it's easier
 us adjust Treasury.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 think that's what's--.
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 [unintelligible], think, issue.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 That's [Peter] implied.
 
 8/22/89
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, sometimes discussions
 whether would useful make greater use
 cash management bills could get post-tax
 
 date bulges cash like. traditionally
 reluctant make much greater use cash management bills, feeling
 relatively costly way fund debt. But, that's
 kind ongoing debate them.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 think one two points,
 
 One don't think need drain
 
 [reserves] really hindered Mr. Sternlight's ability let
 easing show June July. fact, may even help
 
 little sense lets reserves sit little
 longer tends put downward pressure funds rate waiting
 take out. sense it's helpful. point that,
 large extent, need drain--although revealed
 decline Treasury balance--resulted importantly
 warehousing ESF funds also intervention.
 sterilization, really, part balance sheet gave rise
 lot need drain.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes, that's certainly true.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Also, degree instability
 occurs largely inability [unintelligible] matter using cash
 management bills allowing balances move. Everything
 guess could argue, though,
 exact, can't--.
 variables play likely forecasts
 are--
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Offsetting errors?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 Yes, sometimes aren't.

 Okay, see it.
 We're much higher level relative-It's jumping place.

 MR. PRELL. take government. Then,
 private domestic final purchases you're getting

 MR. JOHNSON. Okay. Another question
 mention housing starts potential pickup.
 really marginal upticks [starts], permits continued
 trend down. Even Board staff's adjustment, they're still
 somewhat starts.
 wondered, permits continuing
 trend, whether starts would show turnaround. know
 sort contemporaneous indicators would think starts
 would adjust permits, vice versa.
 MR. PRELL. Well, single-family sector, time
 differential permit start short.
 Statistically cannot find lead-lag relationship data.
 think permits tend less volatile month-to-month.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 That's meant say, statistics.
 
 MR. PRELL. Statistically, [permits] level terms [don't

 No, except haven't shown

 one question, Ted. talked widening

 dollar depreciation assumptions out. revisions,
 current account trade numbers dramatically

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, presumably, relatively good trade

 It's certainly positive

 hopefully, won't turn touch go.

 despite apparent strength sectors economy.

 couple reasons this: first, directors
 business contacts District become bearish
 last couple months they've long time; second,
 probably importantly, monetary policy tightened
 significantly net last 2-1/2 years, even taking
 account recent easing. funds rate still 3 percentage
 points higher late 1986 sharp

 haven't yet seen full impact slower growth
 aggregates real economic activity. So, think
 Greenbook forecast real GNP quite reasonable, think risk
 error skewed slightly side assuming,
 Greenbook does, changes monetary policy.
 far inflation picture concerned,
 course disappointed projections didn't show significant
 decline net rate inflation forecast period.
 think also reasonable forecast.
 think
 possibility lagged effect overall tightening monetary
 policy since early 1987, may show strongly
 generally expected period ahead. Consequently, think
 quarterly rate inflation may slightly lower
