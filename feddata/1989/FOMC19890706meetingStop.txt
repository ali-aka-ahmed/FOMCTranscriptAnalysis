 President Parry?
 MR. PARRY. right, fine. Mr. Chairman, economy
 West currently rather surprisingly robust. Although recent
 monthly employment data California suggest rate growth
 slowing, California economy remain strong level.
 Employment growth Nevada, Washington, Oregon ranks among
 six fastest growing states nation. Outside Alaska
 Arizona real estate markets continue strong. April, statewide
 median home price California rose $200,000 first
 time. Home prices also rising rapidly Washington Oregon,
 far lower levels.
 One curious development comes
 regular survey District business leaders. Almost
 surveyed indicated believe economy, general,
 slowing continue slow. ask
 businesses virtually one sees significant slowing
 businesses, outside lumber industry.
 Despite high level activity West Coast
 outlook national economy really quite similar
 Greenbook. believe economy appears headed sluggish
 economic growth recession. fact, see possibility
 downside risks economy terms economic growth.
 According analysis consumption business-fixed investment
 growing unusually rapidly past two years. reversal
 pattern could mean weaker economy seems likely.
 Despite slower economic growth economy remains full
 employment level. Thus, would agree Greenbook's inflation
 outlook, shows relatively constant rates inflation 1990.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, regard current

 indicators think see tendency moderation
 trending downward. regard forecast, really
 similar Board staff's. somewhat stronger growth

 regard District, seems true
 national level certainly less true within District.
 couple parts District certainly peaked

 It's half half.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 That's think.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, systematic indications.
 questions Mr. Kohn?
 MR. JOHNSON. Don, need review; may mentioned
 go one time. One concerns
 beginning period declining interest rates, clearly, we're going
 see behavior velocity symmetric increase we've
 period rising interest rates; we're going see declining
 velocity growth. Would review again, rule thumb,
 lags on, say, 100 basis point decline interest

 would M2 growth M2 money demand

 kind lags
 catch up?
 MR. KOHN. Well, lags last four five quarters
 full effect felt one-time decrease.
 I'd say 100 basis points current level rates probably
 would give you, say, 1 percentage point something like
 four quarters.
 Dave?
 I'm sorry, would like 2
 percentage points growth rate couple quarters.
 MR. JOHNSON. 100 basis points would yield 2 percentage
 points growth couple quarters?
 MR. KOHN. Yes.
 words, quarter,

 would say that's probably 1-3/4
 percentage points four quarters, judging table.
 
 -34-

 MR. JOHNSON. One concerns that, given lags,
 started sustained period declines interest rates--even
 shooting 5-1/2 percent nominal growth next year--we
 might end absorb 2 full percentage points
 extra M2 growth effects velocity hit
 nominal target. that's think-MR. KOHN.
 think economy going weaker-that underlying demands weaker inflation

 think that. 6-1/2 percent growth projected

 emphasizing tentative aspects recognizing

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think taken away

 next four six quarters achieve long-run
 objectives monetary policy. Accordingly, think it's
 important ranges select 1990 make crystal clear
 public current apparent softening final demand

 think we've excellent monetary policy long time now.
 still underlying inflation rate around 5 percent,
 still distance go that. us, obviously,
 would like achieve price stability minimum disruption
 economy. think price stability really

 primary--and would say single overriding--long-term goal.
 think greater public's confidence commitment
 end, less short-term disruptions going be.
 So, mind, it's highly desirable reduce
 range M2 1990 maintain credibility we've
 long period time. So, strongly prefer
 alternative III. means me, really, want
 underlying rate growth M2 come somewhere around 4-1/2
 percent midpoint 2-1/2 percent 6-1/2 percent range,
 would consistent think we've trying
 long time. Now, recognize staff's baseline forecast M2

 6-1/2 percent range doesn't give us lot leeway error

 movements temporary factor cause us come
 that, long reasonably confident temporary
 something could explain public.
 you'd permit add one final point, Mr. Chairman:
 Every time go exercise, become
 convinced really need change targeting procedures
 look multi-year basis.
 Several us made
 point past; I'd like suggest take look
 because, given base drift, seems pretty
 inefficient way target long-run objectives think
 would like see us, agree that, make

 kind move general direction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 I'm sympathetic Bob Black's perspective
 long run.
 seems want get ranges
 M2 1 5 percent. 1 5 percent range

 mean that, seems that's
 be.
 believe, however, ought back up.

 is, want see us lower ranges never raise them. And,
 Don's report, believe would prudent us 1990
 keep 3 7 percent range.
 seems
 period expectation rising
 interest rates, that's ought go another leg 2

 So, Mr. Chairman, prefer long-run strategy II,
 conservative.
 prefer alternative II 1990,
 I'm willing go exceed top side.
 there's one thing feel strongly 3-1/2 years
 here, whenever erred extremes M2 growth,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, analysis suggests M2

 even slower growth
 would consistent changing ranges, least
 technical grounds. think, though, important
 reduce ranges think send message public
 regarding resolve gradually lower rate inflation

 ought pursuing longer term. Therefore, would support
 suggestion President Black pursue Bluebook alternative III,
 think would still least within range would
 expect growth two aggregates next year.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, given experience
 aggregates year, think it's difficult forecast
 outcome balance year, much less 1990. think
 memo sent analyzing happened far really
 excellent way looking happened. certainly
 fact, doesn't give me, least, real
 assurance aggregates going perform
 future. interim, seem signal effect
 ranges select really very, significant.
 interesting quote Bluebook page 17 says "But
 alternative III involves reduction current
 money ranges might seem accord reinforcing
 Committee's longer-term commitment price stability."
 think
 significant statement. say anything else, really,
 terms choice range would mistake. Therefore,
 would strongly favor alternative III 1990.

 fact things work year along lines suggesting,
 have--as apparently case past--the
 opportunity change ranges February. Clearly, change
 appropriate time, would it. think
 interim would important signal continual commitment

 However, going change them, direction would go in,
 frankly, toward alternative I--for couple reasons. One
 hope get additional M2 growth interest rates come
 down. Secondly, talking base-drift, went back looked
 table: 1987 M2's actual growth 4.1 percent,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would take unchanged

 MR. JOHNSON. That's right; would take too.

 agree long run ranges come down. think
 Governor Angell right 1 5 percent probably makes sense
 longer run.
 you're going nominal GNP that's consistent
 something like price stability, long-run trend M2
 velocity around 0, want M2 range nominal GNP
 associated price stability you've got area
 somewhere.
 think we're ways that. think, Ed
 Boehne said, one major functions avoid destabilizing
 economy process seeking goal price stability. So,
 reasons, 3 7 percent range '90 makes sense,
 even though think could find well target
 go sustained period declining interest rates.
 think it's reasonable target worth trying hit.

 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Listening discussion, hear lot

 there; it's probably higher last year time.
 look Board staff's strategies 1988 1991 there's
 little difference inflation rate. average range

 looking at, think shouldn't kid we're

 controlling inflation current rate. we're comfortable
 think ought say that. we're think
 ought something aggressive terms moving toward price

 don't base drift problems. Otherwise, next year
 point different set concerns short term

 likely difference 3 7 percent 2-1/2 6-1/2

 we're likely miss 1/2 point mark anyway it's

 that's it's about. That's range policy going

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes.
 said that, let
 add comment two.
 say become increasingly
 skeptical, bordering cynical, usefulness reliability
 money supply measures targets indicators monetary
 policy, notwithstanding wonders P*.
 specific
 immediate context I'm nearly concerned think
 slow growth whatever recent past or, indeed,
 several years.
 don't want get big discussion
 would simply say one reasons I'm concerned
 look broad measures credit availability-credit growth, debt growth, L growth--all things
 behaving quite satisfactory way.
 mind, least,
 financial innovation play significant role accounting
 abnormal gap growth, however measured, broader
 measures debt credit overall liquid assets, including nonbank
 
 liquid assets.
 
 I'm quite concerned.
 
 Also, let make brief point context Mr.
 Boehne's comment means end.
 ask question
 context current policy: possible, first, rise
 inflation rate stabilized--that it's going anymore?
 There's reasonable chance that's true, don't think it's
 baked cake. even assume baked cake,
 next question ask myself, relevant
 18-month period, is: would take buy back
 acceleration inflation rate past 18
 months? Forget long-term price stability moment;
 ask would take get back were.

 plausible set reasons believe could recapture
 we've lost without fair amount slack develop
 economy?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 You're saying excluding oil price
 
 effect?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That's right. Maybe
 things working direction; certainly, international competition
 one. history seems fairly compelling point: it's
 awfully hard see get deceleration inflation
 rate, even percentage point so, without slack
 economy. think another aspect goal price
 
 stability.
 
 It's nice talk it, skeptical
 
 even achieve intermediate goal buying back we've
 already lost without incur real costs, much less get
 back genuine price stability 1950's vintage something like
 that.
 So, think Mr. Boehne's point right mark,
 realistic feasible not. Anyway,
 certainly live '89 [ranges] '90.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. brings us next order
 business, standard short-run discussion. Mr. Kohn.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Kohn?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. made point markets built
 current rates quarter point drop funds rate rather
 promptly. quarter point base?
 you--
 
 -44-
 
 7/5-6/89
 
 MR. KOHN.
 think 9-1/2 percent. We've said 9-1/2
 9-5/8 percent, it's averaged closer 9-1/2 percent think
 that's markets think is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Let follow one Manley asked
 earlier.
 lower rates 50 basis points, would expect
 M2 fourth quarter, December, growing 8 percent?
 MR. KOHN. That's correct. see alternative
 Bluebook. 8 percent, actually, June September.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 June September?
 
 MR. KOHN. June September. would encompass
 strengthening pattern M2 growth period. Consequently,
 time got fourth quarter think would 8
 percent range [even] higher.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 fourth quarter December would what?
 
 MR. KOHN. Quarter IV December alternative A?

 don't know. Quarter IV September 3.7 percent, guess-MR. ANGELL. Well, it'd probably 4-1/2 percent
 alternative December.
 right?
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. PARRY.
 MR. KOHN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Right, something like that.
 No, it's 3-3/4.
 That's September; December-If maintain you're going get
 
 kick.
 MR. KOHN. Yes.
 guess may closer 5
 percent--closer midpoint range.
 MR. MELZER. Don, Bluebook comments
 yesterday today fair amount discussion
 market built in, terms expectations.
 don't view
 particularly unusual--that time policy perceived
 move market get ahead itself--or particularly
 damaging expectations ratified. Would
 consistent view past?
 isn't particularly
 unusual it?
 MR. KOHN. Well, certainly unusual

 sitting room meeting. sense intensity
 speculation immediacy size expected rate

 strong upward sloping yield curves expectations; one think
 back six months less pretty immediate movements

 don't measure intense

 totally unusual. go ways this.
 
 It's
 
 MR. MELZER. Well, I'd cautious extent
 let influence do; that's mainly I'm saying.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 think that's right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 other?
 
 I'll follow that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 agree--
 
 No, questions, not--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, reaction that. think it's
 true market discounting fairly immediate 25 basis point
 move. go little out--and agree
 you're saying, Tom--the market discounting point
 bill market. don't-MR. KOHN.
 
 Well, it's 3/4 point, think.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's more; probably mechanical
 estimate bill rate today implying 8.8 percent
 funds rate.
 MR. JOHNSON. normally 3/4 point spread,
 take average Treasury bill rate fed
 funds rate; Treasury bill rate 7.75 percent.
 MR. KOHN. think [translates to] 8-3/4
 percent; mechanical translation varies level rates.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 rate?
 8.8 percent.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 8.8 percent.
 
 Okay, I'm sorry.
 
 MR. KOHN. varies level rates, Governor
 Johnson, make estimate marginal state
 tax rate--since bills exempt state taxes--as well
 coupon equivalent kind [adjustment].
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Sure.
 
 I'm saying--
 
 MR. KOHN. mechanical translation 7-3/4 percent
 [on bill rate] 8-3/4 percent [on funds rate].
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes, think that's right. I'm saying
 that's bill market built in. Now, clearly looks like
 overshoot want be; I'm simply saying
 that's market is.
 MR. KOHN. One sense yield curve see

 questions Mr. Kohn?
 
 MR. STERN. Don, reasons may
 less confident path M2 next 6 months usual?
 MR. KOHN. Well, I'm never confident; must say
 response M2 June last couple months
 roughly expected. Particularly take demand
 deposit component, special influences
 compensating balances whatnot, M2 running stronger
 projected last meeting, that's consistent slightly
 lower interest rate bounceback. June performance reassures

 questions?
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. Since people outside follow reserve
 aggregates--I realize don't target [dropped]

 expect perform rest year?
 MR. KOHN. monetary base growing 3

 MR. JOHNSON. No, quite much;

 MR. JOHNSON. could argue that's related

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. True enough. Unless

 strike happening markets essentially
 responded dramatically expectation economy
 turning respond, necessity coming behind.
 odd way made urgency response somewhat
 muted economy doesn't run funds rate; runs
 long-term bond rate bill rate related

 However, question think confronts us is:
 respond evidence shows?
 personally
 little concerned, indicated yesterday, whether [unplanned]
 inventory accumulation show up. There's question
 data per se show inventory backing up.
 I've
 many business cycles business career
 remembered making exactly statement prior slip final
 demand sudden unearthed backs good deal
 inventory. sudden find general
 weakness.
 wouldn't particularly concerned
 fact that, stage, think money supply data--even
 though projected optimism strengthen--are really quite
 restrained. one thing central bank take
 due notice of, Vice Chairman's concerns, generally
 share, required us maintain financial aggregates
 acceptable pattern. That's really reason
 cones.
 question confronts us issue
 move.
 Frankly, would inclined stage, new
 marginal calculation made Kohn, move borrowing; guess
 seasonal borrowing requirements $50 million, would
 equivalent 25 basis points funds rate.
 ask myself:
 think [of move] potentially risking
 more?
 type problem Governors LaWare Johnson raised yesterday.
 I'm concerned worst thing happen us, far
 
 -49-
 
 7/5-6/89
 
 policy concerned, perceived easing fast
 manner would open possibilities inflationary
 expectations.
 It's hard imagine going get
 long-term bond rate significantly unless economy
 eases quite significantly. dealing situation
 belief Fed opening money supply
 valve we're way down, think risking type
 really would quite
 instability [we want avoid].
 counterproductive endeavor come pressure we've
 imposing because, get major response inflation
 expectations, would drive long-term interest rates higher,
 rather soften weakness economy try create
 can't
 support, could inadvertently precisely opposite.
 say know that, fact, would occur way. But,
 looking way markets behaved recent days,
 fragility instability there. think argument
 Governor LaWare raised yesterday one focused
 on.
 I'm sure come exactly comes policy
 question creating instability,
 response that.
 So, would reluctant stage
 think, crucial us.
 try move way "A," would full $100 million

 Committee decided wanted move somewhat direction

 MR. JOHNSON. would feel moved 25 basis points

 Yes.

 could probably safely move another notch.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 That's I'm saying.
 wouldn't want prejudge that.
 
 No, think that's--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 think would dangerous so.
 So, would like recommend [borrowing] sort half-way toward "A"

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. support formulation

 completely support suggestion
 we've got careful here. Therefore, think symmetric
 language also important reasons you've stated.

 still, said earlier, clear inflation rate

 that, external reasons well, least prepared

 think thrust prescription precisely right.

 So, think going slowly way

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry,
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think it's appropriate us
 move cautiously point.
 It's clear current rates
 inflation problem; even concern fact
 underlying inflationary pressures likely remain problem
 quite while, whether [accept] forecast Greenbook
 others talked around table.
 So, seems biggest mistake would move
 aggressively and, therefore, could support proposition
 put table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 -51-
 
 7/5-6/89
 
 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, great deal sympathy
 policy prescription advocated following reasons:
 first, given long-term goal price stability, I'm
 unhappy right now; least next
 couple quarters I'm unhappy Greenbook
 forecast embedded terms behavior rates.
 Knowing uncertainties exist world, think
 important move gradually, reasons people
 mentioned, adopt approach continue approach
 Chairman fair amount flexibility. things
 could happen intermeeting period would substantially
 change one would read economy.
 So, strongly support
 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 agree, essentially,
 already spoken respect proposal.

 quite likely would opt alternative B symmetric language.
 Essentially, question mind whether really

 Johnson cited--whether going continue throughout

 I'm skeptical even get inflation rate back 4

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's say directive,
 Norm points me, "the FOMC seeks monetary financial
 conditions foster price stability, promote growth," etc.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 probably look these--
 
 MR. ANGELL. Well, someone think language
 somebody doesn't object to?
 MR. PARRY.
 
 What's concern?
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 "Indications inflationary pressures" seems
 like resistance approach. words, inflation pressures
 don't get worse seems like maybe that's we're after.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Isn't we've done?
 
 7/5-6/89

 MR. ANGELL.
 
 That's exactly we've done.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. point earlier that's is,

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. say "taking account
 progress resisting inflationary pressures"?
 MR. HOSKINS. opposed continuing say "price
 stability," [our objective] really maintain current rates
 inflation we've got honest say that.
 not,
