 MR. CROSS. It's interesting least that,

 Questions either gentleman?
 
 MR. JOHNSON. graciously point forecast
 accurate, different interest rate scenario. since
 ask every time, extent follow them: reasons
 would give forecast stay course much
 different interest rate path? would say major
 factors?
 MR. PRELL. Well, one thing, actually
 interest rates rising first half year.
 surprise interest rate path essentially since
 spring. lags, one wouldn't expected large
 deviation recent period. look forward first
 part 1990, get offsetting influence lagged
 
 11/14/89
 
 effects dollar firmness net exports. least two
 things come immediately mind one might able
 explain this.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 rising rates mean funds rate?
 Right, particularly [the funds rate].
 
 MR. JOHNSON. long rates didn't rise, really;
 bounced around little generally trended down, think.
 MR. PRELL.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 one?
 
 never rose much; that's clear.
 Yes.
 
 So, dollar mainly.
 

 
 MR. PRELL. look early 1990 think
 two offsetting considerations affecting GNP growth first part
 1990: lower rates anticipated much
 higher dollar anticipated.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 rate forecast error.
 SPEAKER(?).
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 dollar forecast error offset interest
 Right.
 That's thought.
 That's first approximation.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. One point I'd like raise
 profits. Corporate profits, course, reported weak.
 wondering: closely profits picture compare time
 to, say, 1984--I don't know fingertips--when
 remember similar sort picture developing
 weakening situation occurring manufacturing, think profits
 weaker period; similar type squeeze occurred.
 funds rate raised mid-1984, something like
 that, eased off.
 MR. PRELL. don't think there's comparison. Looking
 chart pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, total
 nonfinancial corporate profits basically shot early recovery
 phase didn't really move much one way 1984.
 began give way toward end year eased
 since almost continuously. sharp drop
 recently. Now, rather peculiar things numbers

 quarter presume BEA also recognize losses

 giving us one-time shocks. don't think there's
 comparison earlier period we're seeing now.
 MR. JOHNSON.

 MR. PARRY. Mike, question. relatively

 traditional relationship changes real disposable

 nondurables services areas?
 MR. PRELL. guess I'm clear you're connecting

 11/14/89
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, typically [equations] show current
 consumption function current lagged values real
 disposable income.
 think Greenbook goes special
 factors may causing consumption responding

 relationship traditional, much strength would get?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 don't think we're anticipating anything
 
 really extraordinary relationship.
 
 personal
 
 consumption expenditures next year growing roughly line
 One might argue, looking rise

 wealth-to-income ratio seen past year
 now, might tend get little stronger consumption growth

 don't think anything extraordinary, given income
 path background wealth effects. Looking
 gyrations relationships past couple years, one needs
 mindful short-run effects increases decreases
 farm income--which probably don't feed consumption
 expenditures--and various special features income
 composition. looking forward, think pretty steady
 relationship income consumption.
 MR. PARRY. lot weakness economy, you're
 looking dollar source weakness, focused nondurables;
 that's 1.1 percent, small. perhaps even
 remarkable services, got 2.6 percent.

 MR. PRELL. We're expecting rates growth items

 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First all, Mike, I've meaning
 ask substantial differences seasonals
 versus BEA's 10-day auto numbers. assume use
 data that's GNP made of.
 numbers different? don't remember [the difference] larger
 first 10 days November.
 MR. PRELL. striking gap. Larry [Slifman]

 considerable gap monthly numbers.
 
 -10-

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seasonally adjusted data

 MR. PRELL. Given recent numbers, think ought go

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 say, it's big difference.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would sense [they]
 saying market falling apart. You're saying it's

 MR. PRELL. Looking assembly schedules seasonal
 versus [theirs], seasonals don't appearance
 significant gap.
 Basically [unintelligible] vendors implied
 significant inventory accumulation going on.
 it's important
 question. recent 10-day figure amplifies again.
 We'll talk more, we've many conversations
 thought maybe-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. you're that, could also
 find is, gather case Boskin, BEA's

 MR. MELZER. would favor "B" symmetric well. could
 live "B" asymmetric, suggested. thoughts
 think quite similar Wayne expressed. First all--and
 mentioned "Call"--we've got careful short run
 overreacting current data. We've move
 months policy. made mistake policy
 don't think we're making now; probably made last winter
 early spring. certainly taken steps last
 five six months, view it, put policy back appropriate
 longer-term course. second point would make relates
 longer-term view we've achieved quite three-year
 period. go back early '87, looking 12 quarters

 That's reflected P* model. It's consistent
 longer-term goals would hate see us trade

 final point that, extent, think
 careful characterize doing. Even though
 believe understand benefits zero inflation,
 however defined, I'm sure broadly supported would be.
 I've heard comments--not today, around table--about
 businessmen thinking environment fine

 think it's important [to recognize] look what's going

 right now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, would go along "B"
 asymmetric language. recognize we've done quite bit

 Clearly, point, Tom expressed well "Call"

 start paying attention aggregates less
 short-term indicators real economic activity else we're
 going headed lot trouble. don't think we've reached
 point yet, that's clearly judgment call. said
 that, think essential keep eyes firmly

 approached very, cautiously.

 Clearly, funds rate got close 6 percent late '86
