 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor johnson.
 
 mr. johnson. recent number chang outlook ani?
 gather put lot togeth recent
 number.
 mr. prell. employ number led us show weaker
 second quarter might otherwis. didn't feel
 comfort push number much thi.
 must sai
 certainli argument--look what's go
 automobil sector--for larger second-quarter number.
 someth feel comfort with.
 mr. johnson. question budget.
 impli strong action budget would restrict economi.
 assum goe drop real interest
 rate? wonder: wouldn't sourc stimulu
 degre too? come restraint view?
 mr. prell. well, complic question, obvious.
 part issu would whether on-shot effort
 hit gramm-rudman target come fiscal year whether
 someth would dramat chang outlook next
 seri year greatli chang expect. open
 latter door you're somewhat sea term econometr

 fall short that, feder reserv accommod
 term try hold real gnp close path would otherwis
 on, think fiscal shock on tend
 lower interest rate. degre would depend part much
 forward expect much bond yield move well

 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. mike, pursu gradual reduct
 rate inflat, it's quit like, isn't it, nois mai
 time obscur trend progress? that's apt happen
 gradual reduct approach signific recess.
 mr. prell.
 
 well, addit that--
 
 mr. angel. so, even though wai mai give
 committe sens lot achiev, think would
 differ pursu cours?
 
 5/15/90
 
 mr. prell.
 correct. suspicion hold
 current monei market condit, econom activ gradual
 pick up.
 see unemploy rate rise much, all,
 come year so.
 sinc believ right
 pressur tendenc inflat point up,
 would make new cours head direct. so, instead
 head south 4 percent coupl year now, feel
 risk inflat would head north 5 percent.
 that's
 signific differ i'd hate make precis that.
 we've said, felt nois affect read
 trend [unintellig] varieti special factor:
 surpris strength dollar earlier year on.
 it's
 alwai difficult read [unintellig].
 so, that's basic
 thrust assess point.
 mr. angel.
 
 well, appreci much lai
 
 polici option us have.
 mr. parri. point somewhat similar governor
 angel's. sentenc page i-3 [of greenbook] sai: "the
 recent data reinforc view long embodi staff forecast
 
 restor disinflationari trend unlik current
 implic stai
 level resourc util."
 long time, small chanc
 restor disinflationari trend and, fact, might even
 produc increas inflationari pressur. that's
 implic.
 mr. prell. that's sai. now, there's second
 part is: feder reserv obvious let
 financi condit go, maintain histor growth path
 resourc util number ar? that's second
 project. on implic resourc util level;
 second financi condit compat
 resourc util level. guess i'd sai i'm littl less sure
 second first there's good deal
 uncertainti first.
 mr. parri. on get's gener feel, though,
 public feel stai would
 continu growth rate around 2 percent gradual
 [reduct inflat]. you're basic sai
 stai ar, growth rate like pick
 abl restor [unintellig].
 mr. prell. sens consensu busi economist
 economi probabl go run 2, 2-1/2 percent
 growth go next year 18 month inflat go
 remain roughli 4-1/2, 4-3/4, 5 percent zone.
 mr. parri. would assum much wai
 interest rate pressur?
 mr. prell. no. sens probabl expect
 littl [chang in] inflat, mayb slowdown-mr. parri.
 
 that's point.
 
 5/15/90
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid hoskin.
 
 mr. hoskin.
 two question, mike.
 on
 earlier period--1988 earli 1989--when rais fund rate
 300 basi point, think. i'd like contrast view
 tradeoff now. rais interest rate lot lot happen.
 built forecast increas 125 basi point
 expect get bang end 1991.
 i'd like compar two period can.
 mr. prell. let go back factual matter.
 built rise fund rate 200 basi
 point come [some] latter half
 next year pressur begin abat.
 mr. hoskin.
 okai, narrow tradeoff littl.
 point i'm make act fairli aggress on
 point time get much, view peopl, term
 [lower inflat] rate. necessarili get disastr
 result either term slow growth, also didn't gain
 lot. kept inflat rate roughli wa.
 guess
 could gotten lot wors done someth.
 don't know
 see differ two period would
 enlighten us now--perhap not.
 second question
 deficit issu.
 argu could get benefit
 lower deficit futur, you've revis 1990 deficit
 up, couldn't argu might need tighten take
 account instead futur?
 mr. prell. well, larg part revis rtcrelat don't think that's real-mr. hoskin.
 
 it's real debt!
 
 mr. prell. measur show shade less restraint
 current fiscal year previous that's mainli
 reflect read inform occur tax
 side.
 look like tax revenu run bit weaker
 anticip. seem come tax reform, read
 lot 1989 experi, revenu fall bit rel
 previous anticip forecast. so,
 littl less restraint it's margin differ, although that's
 [unintellig] factor. look back 1988-1989 experi,
 mani thing differ; on make
 difficult judgment time variou effect.
 point come dollar depreci caus
 consider improv export growth. export grow
 much strongli now. probabl work
 restraint. didn't have, perhap, quit debacl think
 construct side, though offic build
 go significantli wasn't point.
 perhap closer demograph requir hous
 construct [unintellig] cushion interest rate
 effect.
 level somewhat differ.
 think
 parallel two period, differ;
 hard time draw particular lesson. sens is,
 said, contain rate inflat. whether slow
 economi level unemploy rate occur
 
 5/15/90
 
 attribut rise interest rate interest rate
 factor difficult sai.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. hate sound like ginni dimwit todai,
 would walk on time sector next
 two four quarter would take off, would much stronger,
 statu quo monetari polici? word, exactli
 sector on restrain? i'm problem
 find sector there.
 mr. prell. wasn't try character current monei
 market condit altern on led take off,
 mere gravit back recent trend potenti output--a
 sort natur tendenc economi event unless
 countervail forc. short run think could
 littl better due pickup inventori accumul rel
 signific swing seen neg direct
 inventori. without that, final demand economi
 show ultim output growth. didn't get
 rise interest rate, would forecast stronger
 hous sector have. didn't restraint,
 would expect invest stronger. so, start remov
 restraint, interest sensit sector would look bit stronger
 across board we'd probabl add top lean
 toward moder, higher have, level inventori
 accumul. dollar weaker
 there--
 
 ms. seger. would soon see us export more,
 that's person bia.
 mr. prell.
 
 then, i'd begin look fiscal polici--
 
 ms. seger.
 
 right.
 
 mr. prell.
 
 that's [unintellig]
 
 shift.
 
 ms. seger. amount attent pai, then,
 avail credit hous situat?

 often it's price monei price credit much
 strictli unavail.
 mr. prell. well, suggest, commerci real estat
 market mai affect thi. built

 it's larg; it's hundr thousand start forecast,
 mild effect. think would abat time

 ms. seger.
 
 thank you.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 hope you're right.
 
 question mr. prell?
 
 5/15/90
 
 mr. syron. mike, technic question: inventori
 situat seem depend on look it.
 go
 sort structur chang time?
 much weight
 would put structur chang toward just-in-time inventori
 sort thing?
 think it's still pretti accur
 reflector [unintellig]? view inventori
 we're like see bounceback. think there's
 argument [busi move to] perman
 lower level inventori?
 mr. prell. judgment time don't see
 inventori impedi growth product.
 i'm
 inclin read realli strong bullish factor, part
 reason suggest.
 think there's still effort,
 particularli manufactur sector too, decreas
 inventori relat order/shipment ratio. view
 still wai go.
 industri economist meet
 attend recent said: "boi, number look great; boss
 think inventori still high."
 so, think target,
 effect, continu drift downward. on
 reason past year saw manufactur inventori/sale
 ratio essenti level didn't move [our forecast]
 much. thought concern would like lead
 effort restrain inventori. think [it turn out] that's
 pattern we've seen.
 think we're much better shape now;
 still, enthusiasm think we're verg boom
 [unintellig].
 chairman greenspan. actual, leaner think
 number show convent measur inventori
 domest sale, whatev ar.
 [unintellig]
 proport inventori import good. on can't sai
 excess inventori import good effect
 domest product effect product foreign

 percent now. assum also data manufactur,
 make adjust form weigh toward import
 take put final sale total import in,
 inventori/sale ratio much lower [now]

 so, alreadi pretti far down. but, mike

 so, reject rate
