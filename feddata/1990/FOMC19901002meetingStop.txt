 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 [Statement--see
 
 Questions Mr. Prell?
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, know lot oil
 issue, one technical one substantive question.
 technical question: big [drop] see first quarter
 1991 CPI already anticipated
 excise tax?
 MR. PRELL. part first-quarter effect.

 course, timing gasoline tax proposed,
 means we'll get something end year.
 MR. SYRON. question relates forecast two
 mildly negative quarters quite bounceback. know
 it's completely [impossible] anyone forecast what's going
 happen Middle East, wonder likely forecast
 much qualitative point view. Perhaps I'm factoring
 much likely think credit crunch
 much momentum think downturn could cumulate get
 it, particularly consumer confidence side. may may
 offset assumption make oil prices
 would change that.
 MR. PRELL. I'm pleased said make
 assumption because, obviously, degree arbitrariness
 that, hope plausible baseline. feel
 somewhat optimistic--but [unintelligible] think highlight
 kind policy issues confront. Basically, rebound
 follow fairly naturally improvement real disposable income
 would result kind decline oil prices.
 History
 suggests oil price shocks sort tend
 disturb consumers, [thus] see sharp drops confidence.
 previous large drops somewhat similar circumstances.
 Unless economy really follows significantly
 negative performance, one might expect confidence improve somewhat.
 certainly see downside risks credit situation,
 think we've built allowance informal
 way.
 quality spreads widen dramatically, lenders
 really pull horns sharply sense are,
 would certainly drag business spending. We've assumed
 inventories kept tight check coming months;
 that's one reasons weakness production
 forecast. don't buildup [in inventories]; keep
 production lines running. So, positions us nice rebound
 production soon underlying demand picks up.
 enter period weakness, number variables
 could turn negative [projected].
 It's possible
 skate without cumulative decline.
 MR. SYRON. historical analog disturbance
 causing kind muted downturn bouncing back
 quickly?
 MR. PRELL. Well, guess one would reach pretty far
 back find example. supply shock. supply shocks
 
 10/2/90
 
 come mind occurred 1973, period
 things also tended exacerbate recessionary pressures,
 1979-80 period recession oil price shock.

 magnitudes differ general circumstances differ.
 think one couldn't simply appeal historical precedent justify
 forecast.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. PARRY. mentioned conservative inventory policy
 here, basically isn't much cycle inventories.
 Typically, one expects buildup
 feel confident that?
 excess inventories, subsequently run off,
 increased production economy picks up. go
 truth, inventories really pretty
 cycles real GNP.
 [consistently] low levels; may potential source
 greater cyclicality forecast.
 MR. PRELL. Well, suggested, we've assumed
 businesses move inventories consistently sales
 period ahead. sense recent years, given kind
 inventory management practices evolved, pattern
 really support kind assumption behavior. One
 already see awareness part businessmen may
 weak sales months ahead. anecdotal reports
 retailers ordering cautiously fall. Basically,
 looking production adjustment happen rapidly
 that's recession occurring.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Thank you.

 MR. STOCKTON. potential outlook question, I'd say
 given basic forecast, sort continuation

 temporary rise--that we're expecting significant scrapping
 capital stock. principal way
 potential output falls short run. Obviously, [energy]
 maintained higher relative price, would greater
 scrapping capital stock greater substitution away
 energy would [lead] reduction potential output.
 MR. PRELL. complex question--one really want
 look weeks ahead. noted Greenbook, one still
 tentative one's assumptions potential GNP.
 we've yet address broader production framework.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. look GNP data rebased
 1987, tend get lower growth rates [unintelligible], course,
 slower productivity. take look potential,
 question is: going viewing solely context
 1982 dollars 1987 dollars, assume base
 emerging relatively soon? base .1 .2 less,
 recall, systematic basis.
 MR. PRELL. Well, that's one uncertainties.
 And, course, revisions data,
 alter sectoral distribution value added result
 repricing computers on. could alter one's
 impressions going productivity performance.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Let follow on--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 I'm sorry.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. GUFFEY. Looking forecast, Mike, appears
 good deal emphasis put net export sector.
 coming back fairly quickly. kind assurances
 have, given uncertainty Middle East problem, that's
 really going come about?
 coming back quickly,
 seems me.
 MR. TRUMAN. really three factors there.
 answer can't give many assurances, obviously,

 here. short-term effects built in, cause

 So, tends give short-term

 MS. SEGER. I'm back housing kick. I'm reading
 page correctly, estimating housing starts present

 present quarter actually low quarter--although
 next quarter going same. surprises
 see downturn ending quickly--unless you're lot
 optimistic credit situation, which, obviously,

 MR. PRELL. suspect so. doesn't mean we're
 expecting things return kind situation three

 So, it's really matter cutting purchasing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. HOSKINS. First national outlook, don't

 So, think problem making

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. couple comments two
 industries I've following closely last several months.
 One autos.
 Quite bit made fact deliveries
 August September looked pretty healthy,
 used indicator consumer spending falling sewer

 someplace. picked analysts within industry
 two things: (1) seasonals atrocious auto
 industry longer regular seasonal swings used to,
 applying seasonal factors doesn't make lot
 sense; (2) auto sales deliveries statistics
 really distorted time.
 Si alluded it, didn't expand
 it. distorted fleet deliveries, fleet
 
 sales controlled auto companies themselves, primarily
 car rental agencies.
 Big Three car rental agencies
 use deliveries sort cook books, want
 say that.
 less determine kind sales
 
 statistics want report getting either orders placed
 fewer orders placed car rental subs.
 exceptional amount done September couple big
 reasons. One simply didn't enough orders coming
 traditional sources--purchases folks like me--to
 get assembly plants cranked up. needed get
 strength orders, chose provide way. Also,
 continued push industry market penetration.
 There's real horse race there. It's nobody wants blink
 one wants cut back run risk cutting market
 share statistics still more. So, really trying hold
 production up. rating agencies--Moodys
 Standard Poors--and folks really checking carefully
 Big Three days threats downgrading debt
 obligations. Apparently important factors considered production
 market share indication future viability. So, that's
 another factor entering in. Anyway, warned two different
 people statistics taken face value all.
 Also, got interesting statistic showroom traffic, would
 kind consumer would usually think of; dropped
 substantially 15 percent year ago.
 call closure rate, number deals actually closed
 percentage individuals deal with, dropped 20
 percent August. pointed inventories
 building auto inventories probably
 4 days normal truck inventories getting
 20 days dealers would like have.
 Another industry probing Mike homebuilding,
 I've talking lot homebuilders last couple
 months, really problem there. financing
 situation getting attention; started S&L
 problem form limits loans single borrower
 spread way beyond that. hearing
 homebuilders failing closing businesses liquidating, etc.
 Small business groups general, think, showing lot
 nervousness. seem negative. Retailers small
 business category seem cautious Christmas
 orders. Again, Bob Boykin said, small businesses always
 gripes getting credit, I've never heard loud
 time they're talking credit
 lines cut. So, little different lack
 availability initially. credit availability problems
 way beyond small business. Again, we're hearing businesses
 sizes many different industries.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. MULLINS.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 generally agree staff's forecast.
 

 
 think we're facing stalled economy likely dip

 I'm also little less optimistic export side, due
