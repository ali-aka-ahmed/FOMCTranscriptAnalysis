 mr. syron. follow that, term

 littl surpris

 mr. stockton. imprecis calcul.
 import point rememb downward revis potenti

 therefor, cumul effect

 8/21/90
 
 mr. parri.
 two question.
 dave, fomc
 inform call ted truman gave us us rule thumb
 effect chang price oil real growth also
 cpi inflat.
 seem effect inflat
 rather substanti; struck show sharp
 declin fix-weight deflat fourth quarter 4.7
 4.0 percent.
 know impact fix-weight deflat
 differ cpi.
 even take account,
 seem low number. could explain

 mr. stockton. fourth-quarter fix-weight number?
 well, princip reason fix-weight deflat show
 larg effect cpi that, obvious consum
 energi produc, weight energi sever percentag
 point differ cpi gnp fix-weight.
 princip reason differ. mai slight
 differ assum fourth quarter well.

 low increas feder sector fix-weight
 deflat fourth quarter, help pull thing down.
 mr. parri. so, it's across board--smaller increas
 quit sector?
 mr. stockton. would sai that's true, differ
 weight energi share cpi energi share
 gnp biggest factor.
 mr. parri. ye, heard. second point
 realli struck commerc depart revis compens per
 manhour nonfarm busi sector 1989.
 period
 1984 [the end of] forecast lowest compens per
 manhour, exclud 1989, 3.7 percent; forecast it's
 5.1 5.2 percent. whole year [1989] increas
 2 percent area. seem difficult understand
 happen 1989 would make number believ.
 mr. stockton. well, first thing mention that,
 mike point out, yet receiv benchmark revis
 employ hour data. we'll receiv septemb.
 typic, [benchmark revis] occur mai june
 time revis compens per hour figur would come [the
 commerc depart] would alreadi incorpor revis.
 to. result, realli didn't even wish discuss

 mr. prell. don't want offer great hope
 that's go elimin peculiar number.

 mr. parri.

 think so.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 thank you.
 
 presid boehn.
 
 think
 mr. boehn. let compliment report.
 ted excel job difficult situat
 get hold of.
 whole approach on gradual open
 excess capac hope dampen price.
 date, best we've kept price acceler.
 disaggreg price, find progress good sector
 servic sector; good side economi
 respons monetari polici. rais fundament
 question much excess capac on realli open
 economi gener kind anti-inflat progress [we hope
 for] servic side.
 i'm wonder, ar, sai,
 year half strategi, staff given
 thought whether whole thing complic
 fairli simpl notion open aggreg excess capac-that mai simpl fundament strategi
 mai flaw it.
 mr. stockton. guess basic reaction, cours,
 agre statement process consider
 complic open slack inflat chang
 mechan wai. labor market extrem complex
 phenomena, go complic. hand,
 would look event last sever year
 confirm basic underli paradigm contradict.
 is, wage inflat particular downtrend
 1986 unemploy rate 6 percent--realli sens
 somewher 7 6 percent rang.
 unemploy
 rate move that, wage inflat turn around.
 last year, we've unemploy rate 5-1/4 percent we've
 seen mild acceler. yet realli creat, least
 labor market side view, slack would
 suffici reduc trend. now, anoth point made
 think correct seen progress move
 [inflat] back manufactur side slack appear
 open term capac util.
 so, think
 recent event rel kind particular paradigm,
 recogn develop agricultur sector,
 energi sector, movement exchang rate time
 clearli influenc pattern overal price develop.
 point wouldn't see compel reason abandon basic
 paradigm recogn confid [interv] on
 place around estim slack particular
 level slack might actual lead quit wide.
 
 8/21/90
 
 chairman greenspan. well, actual, error
 particip rate labor forc. substitut histor
 forecast labor [unintellig] particip rate,
 unemploy rate open growth. presum, wage
 rate follow previou pattern precis model would
 suggest. think problem we're look arithmet/
 analyt sens is: go particip rate
 labor forc understand?
 i'm sai that's
 sole issu but, unless answer question, we're caught
 dilemma wherebi growth rate don't get loosen
 system.
 mr. prell. also keep mind possibl
 phenomena might affect labor forc
 particip suggest unemploy rate mai captur
 element affect wage behavior.
 labor forc
 particip fall peopl don't feel job
 opportun there, that's somewhat differ kind slack
 system could moder wage increas. so, it's
 complex system. would underscor point doesn't
 seem evid contradict basic view slack
 diminish inflationari pressur.
 inde, channel
 avail us would seem realli affect inflat rate.
 mr. boehn. well, there's fair amount histori
 countri countri [suggest] recess bring
 notic relief inflat. lot evid
 suggest gradual approach open slack
 recess result much.
 mr. prell. that's true haven't extend
 period slow growth.
 question is: slack
 sudden shock declin on see recess realli
 explain that?
 mr. boehn.
 
 right.
 
 mr. prell. note fact last fall

 sort nonlinear system.
 mr. truman. wouldn't want overinterpret

 chairman greenspan.
 
 unemploy rate much
 
 higher?
 mr. truman. well, said, don't want overinterpret
 thi.
 gener accept much less flexibl
 economi and, therefor, natur rate unemploy

 mr. keehn. budget deficit number peter mention,

 that's smaller $50 billion still talk

 sustain period go cut anoth percentag point
 growth. given level growth have, would put
 us near zero below. know make number,
 smooth forecast show someth like zero probabl
 go mean sever quarter neg--on order
