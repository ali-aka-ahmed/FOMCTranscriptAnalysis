 Questions gentlemen?
 
 MR. JOHNSON. First Mike: Given fact
 inflation picture remains stable spite slower growth,
 looking profits trend it's down. quite profit
 squeeze going on.
 hold nominal demand pretty much check,
 given profits picture, doesn't something give?
 Wouldn't
 expect labor costs come down, maybe layoffs
 something?
 weak profits persist there's avenue
 changing terms nominal demand?
 Shouldn't
 cutback costs least recession something?
 MR. PRELL. Well, couple pieces

 One influence

 MR. JOHNSON. Okay, thanks. question Ted
 dollar, something raised yesterday [at Board
 briefing]: realize dollar depreciated peak 1989,
 don't think really depreciated whole year.
 lot wiggles since dollar sort settled
 1987. little trouble secular depreciation
 staff forecast. realize external claims issue
 theoretical issue may support dollar depreciation,
 course monetary policy may something that. looking
 international trends, even though you're projecting slightly
 lower inflation foreign countries, based recent dollar
 depreciation, United States, see right
 almost complete convergence price trends. It's prospective,
 think--going forward inflation trends be. I'm
 struck lower left panel Chart 17, shows right
 almost complete convergence prices. agree
 expectations play part that, convergence inflation

 one factor. prices converge rather break apart like this,
 given interest rate levels now--we're still slightly higher
 Germany terms nominal interest rate levels we're still
 considerably higher Japanese even though narrowed-I'm sure dollar depreciation cards. would say
 that, obviously, inflation diverges again, maybe degree

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, several things. One point

 MR. TRUMAN. relevant interest rates adjusted

 level dollar today, relatively little impact

 MR. JOHNSON. Okay. One last question, Mr. Chairman,
 recent turnaround bond rates: noticed reading
 commentary submitted FOMC, Steve Axilrod's
 comments others' recently, argued
 turnaround bond rates--since real nominal-represents effective tightening policy. don't know
 policy necessarily it, fact analysts
 saying represents relatively tighter situation, let's
 put way, economy. wonder think
 that. that's almost side coin question
 asking long time here: Given fact long-term
 real interest rates coming down, stimulative? I'm
 little skeptical notion [more recent] turnaround
 effective tightening--as much skeptical
 downtrend long rates [being an] easing--because implication
 almost funds rate come want
 effective tightening. response

 Suppose

 MR. PRELL. Well, factor that, three
 things happened financial front recently. dollar

 outpace expectations side. Short-term interest rates
 come clearly borrowing cost number
 businesses households. probably come
 considerably real terms short run. view rise
 long rates least partially real increase;
 long-term inflation expectations risen. Governor
 Angell referred one thing may persistence
 energy front beyond heating oil crunch December. But,
 basically, we've viewed least considerable part
 real increase, shown forecast, particularly
 construction area. Mortgage rates, nominal real,
 factor forecast and, certainly, one element. So,
 things sort balanced greater scheme
 things dollar forecast. tended buoy net exports

 net probably tended damp domestic demands somewhat. We've
 come essentially GNP forecast.
 MR. PARRY. Isn't suggestion increase

 MR. JOHNSON. It's difficult question. move
 sharp. long-run inflationary expectations surveys ticked
 slightly, much. least one I've seen-Hoey--has hardly moved.
 MR. PRELL. Well, actually, Hoey hasn't done survey since
 recent run-up curve. So, it's worth, don't
 one look at.
 MR. JOHNSON. guess so. Okay. think people
 would say there's significant real component even

 plausible explanation sort positive real rate increase

 MR. PRELL. That's one problems looking real

 MR. SYRON. complete presentation

 alternative III--though advantage maybe signaling

 So, think alternative need
 accomplish objectives 1990, potentially sets
 us right path subsequent years well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes, agree that. M2, alternative II
 makes perfect sense. It's consistent strategy II getting
 inflation time. wouldn't mind going
 alternative III ranges M3 debt. M2, certainly,
 alternative II makes sense me. would think
 strategy II scenario consistent alternative II ranges-even though may actual inflation trends--moving
 toward 2 percent time, assuming that's trend.
 could accompany downward trend actual inflation expectations
 really could achieve Chairman described price
 stability anyway. Obviously, may lag adjusting
 actual inflation rate. '80s consistent
 downtrend 10-year long-term inflation expectations. even
 recently, long-term increases moved 12-month

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. 1990 I'd keep simple:
 alternative II reasons Mr. Parry stated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, agree support alternative
 II, also think helpful longer-term view
 strategies mean. important is, still
 live 1990. think questions
 ask are: much risk recession 1990 willing bear
 much
 order keep inflation accelerating?
 flexibility need 1990 long-run ranges deal
 think
 threat recession, get serious?
 alternative II also encompasses right balance 1990 well
 longer-run outlook. Alternative III simply doesn't give us
 much flexibility regard alternative takes us
 wrong direction inflation. So, immediate year, 1990,
 well longer-run considerations, alternative II makes
 sense.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, share enthusiasm

 strategy inflation coming 2 percentage points

 contrast that, seems
 minimum progress ought aim for, baseline would us
 coming inflation rate still 3 percent

 realize
 political problems. go 3 7 percent tentatively
 range M2 last time--although argued forcibly, thought
 extremely persuasively, ought 2-1/2 6-1/2 percent

 also think risk something lower
 inflation time. risk bothers look strategy
 II unemployment rate going 6 percent; I'm
 
 2/6-7/90
 
 -32-
 
 sure bothers everybody else room too.
 But, Governor
 Angell said, Phillips curve type model Bluebook
 points out, think wisely, restrictive policy might well
 change expectations increase credibility efforts
 reduce cost getting there. So, tradeoffs might
 unfavorable. Finally, beyond that, would say need give
 consideration risk associated outcome like one

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, I'm concerned all'these choices
 circumstances find in.
 I'm worried moment
 we're going get price stability; I'm worried
 we're going start bring inflation think ought
 somewhat modest objective. seems one
 [unintelligible] M2 growth. look recent history
 M2, pointed out, running last 3 years
 increases 4-1/4 5-1/4 percent per year. Even allowing
 slippage, suggests upper limit M2 range 1990

 really concerned anything
 would represent, obviously, significant acceleration
 view
 recent trends would help us inflation side.
 would make difficult bring inflation future.
 really think we're placing awful lot emphasis precision
 
 relationships alternatives strategies; find
 difficult accept. So, personally think something
 like M2 range 3 6 percent appropriate here. guess
 I'm really concerned M3 debt.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. seems
 critical question Committee juncture whether
 we're really dedicated bringing inflation zero

 may be--or whether we're simply willing [to accept]
 happy inflation find now. look
 exercise--and think helpful go 5 years--but fact
 matter one considers cost taking action
 bring inflation current level, none strategies
 gives much comfort. say, we're making much
 progress inflation toward price stability, given one
 three strategies. result, would conclude
 maybe best efforts cap inflation thought
 way we're going get inflation
 recession quite likely recession occur within next
 5 years--particularly hold growth trend line
 long period time. don't think there's time modern policy

 recession real possibility timeframe. matter
 fact, may something gets us toward price stability. So,
 alternative II upcoming period appropriate one,

 Obviously, we're tricky period here. But, first all,

 MR. KOHN. would agree half statement

 [Coffee break]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let start making comments
 think going sense issues
 concerned about. analytical purposes policy purposes
 think it's probably well worthwhile separating, extent
 one can, physical aspects economy--more specifically,

 process modest acceleration going on. Initial claims,

 Unfortunately, running simultaneously

 But, prices defined terms equivalent profit margins

 that's improvement. expectations improved whether
 really think inflation not. [forecasts] show that. So,
 think happened standards gotten tougher
