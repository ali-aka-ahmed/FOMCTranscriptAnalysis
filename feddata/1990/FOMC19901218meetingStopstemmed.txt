 see that, would wait discount rate
 chang. would rais bit uncertainti it's certainli
 complet doabl technic perspect. would perhap lead
 small increas feder fund rate volatil, small.
 mr. keehn. peter, think mayb answer
 question, let go back again. year-end
 issu, keep hear capit level constraint
 year year-end pressur go particularli tough.

 seem reach peak end novemb came off.
 last coupl dai we've seen move back
 near panicki feel seem novemb. aw
 lot prepar undertaken year-end case we're
 hear institut prepar abl, within
