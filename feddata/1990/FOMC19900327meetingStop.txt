 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mike, one interesting parts monetary
 policy options sometimes correct
 sometimes incorrect forecast, also sometimes bold
 sometimes timid. I'm wondering forecast
 us timid. is, you're saying 100 basis points
 higher short-term interest rates toward end year. Well,
 you're correct forecast, bring interest rate
 increase large second quarter? Wouldn't produce
 better achievement Federal Reserve objectives? would,
 course, make Ted's forecast wrong. wouldn't bold
 thing do, Mike?
 MR. PRELL. couldn't would make Ted's
 forecast wrong! I'd never hear end it! something

 we're trying give indication think monetary policy

 Indeed, one might debate whether proper objective

 MR. PRELL. We've always recognized possibility.
