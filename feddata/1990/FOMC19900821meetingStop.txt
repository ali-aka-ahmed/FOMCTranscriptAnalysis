 August 21, 1990
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone.
 controversial issue: approval minutes.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 move.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 second?
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 We'll start
 
 Without objection.
 
 Sam Cross.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Sam?
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 Sam, unwinding DM warehousing
 related collateral problems respect notes?
 Treasury that? reason Treasury give?
 MR. CROSS.
 Well, think Treasury interested,
 are, [warehousing] amounts continue indefinitely
 big. So, conditions
 possible make arrangements order bring holdings
 down, reluctant hesitant this.
 It's
 envisaged continuous perpetual facility.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 MR. CROSS.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 looking bring down?
 mark holdings?
 Yes.
 don't plans present time.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Sam?

 first time recall extraordinarily long time
 transactions. last time
 transactions intermeeting [period]?
 MR. CROSS. Well, don't think intervention
 transactions last period.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 ratify some.
 
 MR. CROSS. I'd look up, hasn't
 exchange market intervention months.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I'm aware. quite
 frankly, it's first time recall long time
 [need for] ratification.
 MR. CROSS.
 
 We'll check date.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Peter Sternlight's [area].
 
 same, course, apply
 
 8/21/90
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Shall proceed?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes, please.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Mr. Sternlight?
 
 MR. PARRY. Peter, think number primary
 dealers year now?
 basically happening?

 
 assume pressures likely get better terms
 profitability.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, experience opening five
 six months year little better last year. wouldn't
 surprised see decline several dealers.
 still enough, certainly, serve needs
 needs market. got along nicely decade
 number varied mid-30s, think would
 satisfactory kind number now.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 may get back that?
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. It's possible we'll
 decline [in number primary dealers], yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions?
 not, may
 motion ratify transactions since July meeting?
 MR. SYRON.
 
 move.
 
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. We'll move
 staff report economic situation. I'd like first call
 Mike Prell.
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, away last three weeks
 missed much excitement. reason I've asked Dave
 Stockton, reach exciting conclusion,
 present domestic side outlook.
 MR. STOCKTON.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Thank you. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Stockton Truman?
 
 Thank you.
 
 Questions Messrs.
 
 MR. SYRON. Part Greenbook talk
 revision inflation forecast say it's primarily
 oil outlook. wondering, since
 figures came that--this exercise
 speculation, realize--if redoing Greenbook [the
 invasion by] Iraq occurred, rough estimate would
 terms forecast change inflation?
 
 8/21/90
 
 MR. STOCKTON. think going estimate something
 roughly order .1 higher price inflation 1991
 1992 well, made changes outlook path
 offset that.
 dollar obviously going providing
 little boost domestic prices. downward revision
 mentioned made estimate potential output,
 part downward adjustment trend productivity, also
 would implied bit pressure prices previously
 thought.
 MR. SYRON. follow that, terms
 downward revisions?
 revised 1/4 point, guess,
 estimate potential. revisions saw actual data
 pretty disturbing say least. special
 factors caused revise further?

 model came 1/4 point decline potential
 given data have?
 little surprised
 wasn't greater decline potential, given unemployment
 rate remained same.
 MR. STOCKTON. imprecise calculation.
 important point remember downward revision potential
 output extended downward revision potential output
 way back 1980.
 Therefore, cumulative effect
 level potential output time get 1990 quite large.
 Essentially, we're trying this: Every year
 receive GNP revisions try feel around [determine]
 sort underlying trend productivity would best explain course
 activity entire business cycle.
 absence
 particular reason assuming pronounced break
 growth rate potential output last two years,
 essentially adjusted entire path extending way back
 previous peak.
 So, terms level slack one ends
 with, appears revised 1/4
 percentage point last two years real GNP figures
 revised much more, might implied even
 would somewhat greater slack. cumulative effect
 revised trend 10 years implies [when]
 get end slack much different, we've-MR. SYRON. sensitive model short-term changes
 demographics--the composition labor force?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 It's sensitive all.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. concern sense
 there's little chance demographics wrong
 get pretty much pattern [unintelligible] labor
 force construct labor force payroll data
 insured unemployment.
 show degree tightness
 exhibited sample surveys which, evidence
 see, suggests statistical anomaly that's going
 get revised next year.
 MR. PRELL. taking another cut get
 revisions employment data next month. may
 something additional report then.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 8/21/90
 
 MR. PARRY.
 two questions.
 Dave, FOMC
 information call Ted Truman gave us useful rules thumb
 effects change price oil real growth also
 CPI inflation.
 seems effects inflation
 rather substantial; struck show sharp
 decline fixed-weight deflator fourth quarter 4.7
 4.0 percent.
 know impacts fixed-weight deflator
 different CPI.
 even taking account,
 seems low number. Could explain
 indicate contribution oil making number?
 MR. STOCKTON. fourth-quarter fixed-weight number?
 Well, principal reason fixed-weight deflator show
 large effect CPI that, obviously consume
 energy produce, weights energy several percentage
 points different CPI GNP fixed-weight.
 principal reason difference. may slight
 differences assumed fourth quarter well.

 low increase federal sector fixed-weight
 deflator fourth quarter, helping pull things down.
 MR. PARRY. So, it's across board--smaller increases
 quite sectors?
 MR. STOCKTON. would say that's true, difference
 weights energy share CPI energy share
 GNP biggest factor.
 MR. PARRY. Yes, heard. second point
 really struck Commerce Department revisions compensation per
 manhour nonfarm business sector 1989.
 period
 1984 [the end of] forecast lowest compensation per
 manhour, excluding 1989, 3.7 percent; forecast it's
 5.1 5.2 percent. whole year [1989] increase
 2 percent area. seems difficult understand
 happened 1989 would make numbers believable.
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, first thing mention that,
 Mike pointed out, yet received benchmark revisions
 employment hours data. We'll receive September.
 Typically, [benchmark revisions] occur May June
 time revised compensation per hour figures would come [the
 Commerce Department] would already incorporated revisions.
 to. result, really didn't even wish discuss
 figures Greenbook think point
 pretty meaningless.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 MR. PRELL. don't want offer great hope
 that's going eliminate peculiarities numbers.
 series seems move ways inexplicable times.
 think ECI data reliable guide than-MR. PARRY.
 
 certainly seems way point.
 
 8/21/90
 
 -5-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. ECI data far comparable
 monthly average hourly earnings numbers; numerator
 denominator comparable.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 compensation numbers.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 guess revision would horrendous
 
 think so.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 think
 MR. BOEHNE. Let compliment report.
 Ted excellent job difficult situation
 get hold of.
 whole approach one gradually opening
 excess capacity hoping dampen prices.
 date, best we've kept prices accelerating.
 disaggregate prices, find progress goods sector
 services sector; goods side economy
 responsive monetary policy. raises fundamental
 question much excess capacity one really open
 economy generate kind anti-inflation progress [we hope
 for] services side.
 I'm wondering, are, say,
 year half strategy, staff given
 thought whether whole thing complicated
 fairly simple notion opening aggregate excess capacity-that may simple fundamental strategy
 may flaws it.
 MR. STOCKTON. guess basic reaction, course,
 agree statement process considerably
 complicated opening slack inflation change
 mechanical way. labor markets extremely complex
 phenomena, going complicated. hand,
 would look events last several years
 confirmation basic underlying paradigm contradiction.
 is, wage inflation particular downtrend
 1986 unemployment rate 6 percent--really sense
 somewhere 7 6 percent range.
 unemployment
 rate moved that, wage inflation turned around.
 last year, we've unemployment rate 5-1/4 percent we've
 seen mild acceleration. yet really create, least
 labor market side view, slack would
 sufficient reduce trends. Now, another point made
 think correct seen progress moving
 [inflation] back manufacturing side slack appears
 opened terms capacity utilization.
 So, think
 recent events relatively kind particular paradigm,
 recognizing developments agricultural sector,
 energy sector, movements exchange rate times
 clearly influence pattern overall price developments.
 point wouldn't see compelling reason abandon basic
 paradigm recognizing confidence [intervals] one
 place around estimates slack particular
 level slack might actually lead quite wide.
 
 8/21/90
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, actually, error
 participation rates labor force. substitute historical
 forecasts labor [unintelligible] participation rates,
 unemployment rate opens growth. Presumably, wage
 rate following previous patterns precisely model would
 suggest. think problem we're looking arithmetic/
 analytical sense is: going participation rates
 labor force understand?
 I'm saying that's
 sole issue but, unless answer question, we're caught
 dilemma whereby growth rates don't get loosening
 system.
 MR. PRELL. also keep mind possibility
 phenomena might affecting labor force
 participation suggest unemployment rate may capture
 elements affecting wage behavior.
 labor force
 participation falling people don't feel job
 opportunities there, that's somewhat different kind slack
 system could moderate wage increases. So, it's
 complex system. would underscore point doesn't
 seem evidence contradicting basic view slack
 diminish inflationary pressures.
 Indeed, channels
 available us would seem really affect inflation rate.
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, there's fair amount history
 country countries [suggesting] recession bring
 noticeable relief inflation. lot evidence
 suggests gradual approach opening slack
 recession result much.
 MR. PRELL. That's true haven't extended
 periods slow growth.
 question is: slack
 sudden shock decline one sees recession really
 explains that?
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. noted fact last fall
 presentation inflation--that uncertainty whether
 sort nonlinearity system.
 MR. TRUMAN. wouldn't want overinterpret
 information, current Canadian experience
 slow growth extended period time, recession,
 consumer price inflation begun bend down. year-over-year

 rate declined 1/2 percentage point.
 helped, want put way, depreciating dollar.
 I'm
 sure accurate [linkage] is, example
 basic strategy essentially same--maybe little
 so--seems producing results along lines.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 long following it?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. They've for, depending
 count things, year half so.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 Longer us?
 
 8/21/90
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, little longer. They've slower
 growth; come higher growth [rate]
 [unintelligible].
 sense deceleration
 growth period unemployment began turn
 early part year.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 unemployment rate much
 
 higher?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, said, don't want overinterpret
 this.
 generally accepted much less flexible
 economy and, therefore, natural rate unemployment
 higher. market mobility forth tighter
 complicated laws; one explanation
 started somewhat higher inflation rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. budget deficit numbers Peter mentioned,
 particularly $300 billion, little higher heard.
 combination lower revenues higher expenditures,
 presume. expenditure side, mainly RTC-related
 expenses categories also going up?

 take higher number, way finance
 without big upward pressure rates?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Maybe shouldn't respond haven't
 seen official estimates anywhere area. said,
 assumes soft economy--skirting along edge recession
 private estimates actual recession--so
 definitely weakening revenues. budget package thrift
 bail-out expenditures greater current fiscal year.
 MR. PRELL. Let try put perspective
 forecast.
 fiscal 1991 $35 billion deficit reduction.
 That's smaller $50 billion still talking
 perhaps people concerned recent developments
 would think maybe even $35 billion question point.
 Dave indicated, last meeting talk
 leading us think maybe $35 billion pessimistic.
 point, looks like healthy adjustment given political
 situation. take out, could begin move
 closer $250 billion deficit, including $70 billion RTC-related
 [expenditures] fiscal 1991.
 overlay weaker
 economic picture--say, growth mild recession
 next year--then could easily move toward $300 billion level.
 discussion $250-$300 billion deficit inconsistent
 kind picture we've depicted Greenbook.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Si Keehn asked question
 budget, perhaps could also ask Ted $25 oil price
 assumption. assume increased production Saudis?
 MR. TRUMAN. Yes. Dave said, assumed essentially
 shortfall 4-1/4 million barrels day Iraq Kuwait.
 assumed offset 2-1/4 million barrels day.
 Partly
 
 8/21/90
 
 felt useful write figures could
 sense check assumptions--and emphasize assumptions--later
 realities, assumed 1-1/2 million barrels day
 Saudi Arabia, [300,000] barrels day Venezuela 200,000 barrels
 each, think, UAE Nigeria spread around.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Also, description real GNP
 targets, said something 50 percent decline in-MR. TRUMAN.
 
 No, 50 basis points.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 I'm sorry, 50 basis point decline
 Could say
 funds rate.
 didn't quite catch said.
 again?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, order achieve real GNP target,
 model made us, put way, reduce funds rate

 gradually gap baseline [unintelligible].

 MR. MULLINS. answer defense spending

 MR. PRELL.
 
 That's true.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 I'd like get insight, Dave,

 off] whatever inventories needed to.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Yes, want get back simulation.

 understand right, neutral policy going forward
 generate essentially nominal GNP.
 It's
 components would differ; would lower output higher
 inflation. open slack economy inflationary
 surge temporary. say don't take account
 expectations; haven't talked much that.
 think one could
 argue interest rates going around world--every place,
 really, except United States--we could see deterioration
 inflationary expectations. question is: think
 that? secondly, real forecast?
 MR. TRUMAN. Obviously, neutrality oil prices
 feature model. Whether it's feature history,
 least it's captured model. there's particular
 theoretical reason necessarily prevail least
 degree has; maybe [unintelligible].
 far model goes,
 you're correct forward-looking expectations
 model, though it's quite clear world
 dealing would ground forward-looking expectations
 expectations about, among things,

 adopt least, mechanical feature, slightly different

 stimulative way, conceivably. It's complex process it's
 going depend response those-MR. TRUMAN. Well, think point you're getting
 drove process far enough, would one
 interpretation. might even minor. 1970s process
 would result circumstances which, although short run
 mechanics model would generate lower real interest rates
 forth on, longer run would higher built-in
 level inflation associated dislocations believe
 underlie that. could get us higher plateau inflation
 [and lower] long-run potential economy
 circumstances [than we] would assume, even though short run
 might stimulative effects Mike described.
 MR. PRELL. think third alternative illustrates
 degree showing higher level inflation would have.
 MR. TRUMAN. it's relatively optimistic because, Dave
 said President Boehne's question implied earlier, sense
 fundamental forecast accepts amount slack that's built
 underlying forecast--given shocks oil
 price increases--is enough begin bend inflation. it's
 postponed it's higher level.
 MR. KOHN. moved contain nominal GNP growth
 alternative, two things would pushing nominal GNP growth-both prices output. tried hold nominal GNP growth,
 you'd price adverse inflation
 [unintelligible] less real growth nominal GNP growth.
 MR. HOSKINS. Well, agree said. guess
 I'm getting markets may behave somewhat differently
 respect expectations perhaps 1970s
 fact fooled. higher real rates,
 implication seems higher unemployment quicker.
 want avoid going back 1970s [experience], one policy
 response would signal markets we're going
 accommodate long run could lower costs
 [unintelligible].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. different question guess
 would call worst-case scenario "what if" games. try
 model see impact would one
 horrendous sequesters hear kicked around town--if knock
 $100 billion send pink slips federal employees
 things like that?
 MR. STOCKTON. yet run model
 something acute sequester size could occur
 current legislation. reason yet done
 dislocation would enormous point it's
 difficult imagine politically weeks election
 either Administration Congress would wish
 sequester $100 billion, size we're talking
 here, go effect. fact, mid-session review Mr.

 MR. PRELL. I'm sure it's automatic,
 provide Congress temporarily suspend [the Gramm-Rudman
 cuts].

 MS. SEGER. second question regard worst-case
 scenarios involves oil prices.
 remembered difficulties
 1970s 1980s getting even direction oil prices right,
 would impact economy of, let's say, tremendous
 additional acceleration oil prices $35 barrel
 Iraqis also take Saudi Arabia major producer?
 tried scenarios model?
 I'm saying
 terribly likely outcomes high probability assumptions but--
 
 -14-
 
 8/21/90
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, nonlinearities involved
 this, range models tell would get
 proportionally kinds responses little more. Instead
 losing 1/2 percentage point growth, would lose another 1
 percentage point plus growth next four quarters--at least
 abstracting dislocation effects, would argue
 think would argue probably would there. So, models would
 suggest $35 oil price rather $25 oil price
 sustained period going cut another percentage point
 growth. given level growth have, would put
 us near zero below. know make numbers,
 smooth forecast show something like zero probably
 going mean several quarters negatives--on order
 magnitude.
 MS. SEGER. else could face would throw
 forecast trash can?
 [Laughter.]
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Put file cabinet?
 
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Trash appropriate.
 
 MR. PRELL. always innumerable uncertainties.
 think we've layered normal ones. very,
 big imponderables point. might say--and
 might seem silly normally, close loop entirely
 Gramm-Rudman issue--if declaration war, would
 suspend Gramm-Rudman [provisions].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. PRELL.
 inconceivable.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 probability zero.
 
 That's raised point.
 
 It's
 
 Well, thank playing game me.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions,
 would like start Committee discussion?
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, would like ask question
 staff respect forecast laid out.
 give us export numbers contained staff's forecast,
 seems forecast assumes growth
 industrialized countries continue fairly strong. know
 discussion already, given uncertainty
 oil situation reactions Germany Japan example
 respect interest rates, comfortable
 maintain exports level projecting?
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, that's one conditional dimensions
 forecast. We're reasonably comfortable, given particular
 oil price scenario built here. baseline scenario
 think would spurt inflation, reduction growth,
 reduction exports short run--over next several
 quarters. economies--at least continental European
 economies Japan--in general would relatively robust.
 still phenomenon rebuilding eastern Europe East Germany
 driving economies help sustain exports,

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, reporting first conditions
 District prior Middle East events, must say
 certainly surprised, positively, resilience Midwest
 ability District economy rise national
 trend, least far. Certainly, GNP revisions reduced
 baseline forecast least somewhat, pre-Middle East events
 continued positive expectation economy. forecast
 continued improvement year next year.
 couple specific comments. steel business
 continues good. company talked currently operating
 level 85 percent capacity; order books full
 third quarter; fourth-quarter orders coming well;
 experienced normal summer slowdown
 generally year. continue look shipments year
 83 84 million tons, equal last year.
 even prior Middle East events, something boomlet
 going steel used energy-related activities. Demand sheet
 bar continues good. significant change
 order book see downturn demand heavy
 structural items would go commercial construction. Recent
 price increases steel industry sticking,
 average still time 6 percent last year.
 construction area, year-to-date basis nonresidential
 residential construction District comparatively
 strong. We've plus numbers categories versus negative
 numbers national basis. one item, backlog
 cement shipments, currently running 40 percent higher
 year last year, least one shipper. said that,
 sense current perspective
 postponements major commercial projects outright
 cancellations. think within last couple weeks even
 Midwest change attitudes there. One supplier
 commercial construction business tells attitudes
 rather worse experienced since 1981 1982.
 auto business continues sector enormous
 uncertainty. talk one company late last Friday
 continue hold sales forecast cars light trucks
 together 14.4 million year. they're looking 14.3
 million next year. numbers, least eyesight,
 look pretty good, baseline number 15.4 million. So,
 they're baseline number amount, think
 conditions pretty negative. Third-quarter production schedules
 year 17 percent last year; fourth-quarter schedules
 
 -16-
 
 8/21/90
 
 10 percent last year. But, clearly, production risks
 point side. even late third
 quarter projected pickup 17 percent likely erroneous.
 Meanwhile, auto dealer attitudes negative. One would expect
 pickup orders possibility strike; despite
 again, company
 that, dealers aren't ordering cars.
 talked to, 27 percent dealers operating loss,
 
 accounts negativism.
 
 heavy truck business bad.
 
 One manufacturer talked looking shipments class E
 trucks, heavy trucks, year 125,000 units; that's lower
 
 others 133,000 135,000. Again, that's
 baseline number 160,000. So, clearly, they're
 bad year.
 agricultural sector, growing conditions continue
 good, late plantings reasonably cool
 summer we've far, crops bit slower [coming in]
 normal. yield going determined largely timing
 first frost. reasonable break first frost,
 production could excellent and, indeed, farm income high.
 There's shot least record farm income.
 regard credit lending conditions, continue
 think really phenomenon caused banks
 going self-correcting process. think they've raised
 lending standards. even increases C&I lending
 District weekly reporting banks lower year last, numbers
 nonetheless positive. C&I lending small banks
 District higher year case last year. So, maybe
 we're seeing bottoming trend--at least genuine C&I
 lending, taking merger-related activity like.
 reassured bankers good credits--they emphasize
 word "good"--there plenty money available. say
 raised credit standards.
 Shifting post-Middle-East-events comment look
 national economy, think it's early assess damage
 we're likely experience. said that, haven't talked
 anybody far specifically changed business pattern
 way operations. companies
 going capital budgets, contradictory
 [comments] that. companies planning pull back
 capital spending programs, talk one company that's
 quite opposite. process accelerating
 capital spending sense level inflation
 higher and, therefore, want get expenditures
 occurs.
 Now, continue feeling, least intuitive
 sense, economy operating moderate level
 Middle East events certainly negative this. it's
 awfully hard judge outlook particular point. And,
 therefore, certainly monetary policy sense, it's awkward
 period.

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District, employment

 it's running little 1 percent more. Following
 national pattern, employment manufacturing construction

 rates continue area 3 4 percent, bad

 bulk layoffs take place, loss jobs

 healthy gains nonmanufacturing sectors. Real estate activity
 slow. There's question sales permits
 significantly. Median home prices indicate drop home prices
 but, indicated Greenbook, decline reflects
 shift composition sales lower priced areas, particularly
 Sacramento, Riverside, places like that, also smaller
 homes.
 Turning national economy, although risk
 recession certainly real, upward revisions retail sales
 May June, June drop inventory/sales ratio,
 favorable report June net exports certainly encouraging.
 appears though, better balance inventories
 sales, positive real growth second half quite likely.
 Although Greenbook's oil price assumptions reasonable,
 believe effect inflation second half year
 larger indicated Greenbook. addition,
 impact higher oil prices stimulating business investment could
 turn bit greater implied Greenbook forecast.
 Finally, although future drop oil prices assumed certainly
 would help moderate inflation, don't think forget
 effects dollar depreciation, quite substantial.
 latter, plus continued upward pressure wages, prevent
 significant decline inflation next year. Thank you.

 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, gloomy news continues track

 pre-Saddam period. exacerbated extent
 Middle East problem--at least terms peoples' expectations-in share energy provided rely 50 percent

 tends offset somewhat completely.
 District, pressing immediate issue continues

 Even came up, though, really quite poor tourist

 Construction employment, course, fallen strongly,
 still way go.
 Even though level construction
 employment fallen significantly, still 1981
 level; think continue drag. Beyond that,
 we've seen weakness spread services trade sectors.

 trade sector particularly, we've seen fairly significant declines

 Conference Board data show even oil situation

 means
 results nine years better results year.
 Certainly, old fashioned monetarist gives one pause.
 Now,
 doesn't mean monetary aggregates important;
 probably means look somewhat lower M2 growth
 rates achieve objective first thought necessary.
 also look real interest rates, think crude
 check regard distinguishing periods monetary
 policy apparently easy, 1970s, versus
 real interest rates prevailed 1980s, general
 4 4-1/2 percent range. Certainly, seems likely, given
 tax changes regard deductibility interest,
 real interest rates consistent inducing change
 household savings patterns. sense, think us ought
 much enthused regarding level consumer

 high that, consequently, rise saving rate-which means diminution rate growth consumer spending-is exactly doctor would order.
 Now, seems look forward-looking indicators
 really [help one] begin pinpoint bit better monetary
 policy easy restrained.

 forward-looking indicators clearly show monetary policy 1988
 maybe first three quarters 1989 indicative
 rather significant restraint. Whether you're looking commodity
 prices, yield curve, foreign exchange value dollar,
 get confirmation fact money growth prevailing

 upward movements commodity prices supported exchange

 nine months moved--though monetaristic determined
 way looking monetary policy--from monetary restraint monetary
 ease.
 don't think abrupt move; think
 gradual move. probably altered real interest
 rates significantly, dramatically [foster] much
 expansion period ahead. think quite apparent
 yield curve indicating participants real market

 may providing. Certainly, [that seen in] commodity prices.
 staff favor Chart 7 indexing commodity
 prices first quarter 1986, way little

 prices within range 10 percent 10 percent

 monetary restraint seem characteristic

 So, there's
 nothing gives indication monetary policy

 Indeed, foreign exchange value

 would consider marginally gloomier last time,
 really clear evidence recession, brighter gloom

 guess we're still pinning hopes exports. Looking back

 think legitimately

 So, overall, think we've seen little progress

 although news media tends equate two [earlier]

 Certainly, we're going see higher CPI numbers. Governor Angell

 Good idea.

 Appendix.]
 
 Mr. Kohn.
 
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 [Statement--see
 
 Questions Mr. Kohn?
 
 MR. PARRY. I'd like ask question
 referred "felicitous" outcome involving unchanged
 [nominal] income path shock which, course, leads
 [un]changed interest rate path M2 path. critical
 implications policy decision make here. bothers
 little seems bit counter-intuitive; also, know
 couple models least different results.
 would
 seem likely, oil shock magnitude we're talking
 about, first year probably going see
 impact higher prices real side. would suggest
 order get path nominal income growth would
 need higher interest rates somewhat slower growth M2.

 indeed nominal income path want now,
 critical difference.
 don't know much effort spent
 trying verify look different ways, assuming
 unchanged nominal path want, it's critical
 interest rate path consistent.
 MR. KOHN. Well, let make one two comments
 Dave Ted may want comment well. One is--and follows
 conversation before--that think it's important distinguish
 GNP prices CPI.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. KOHN. get lot [effect] CPI, given
 imports given higher weight energy,
 would GNP prices.
 Secondly, it's sort function
 model; falls model's parameters, based
 past experience.
 think could argue past experience
 distorted; controls certain cases things like that.
 So,
 think particularly difficult get reading what's going
 happen now.
 
 8/21/90

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There's also interesting change
 translation crude oil product prices time relative
 
 last time.
 
 used long lag; it's instantaneous.
 
 MR. PARRY.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 Well, price controls.
 Yes, everything distorted controls,
 
 certainly first period. So, thought past experience
 may good guide. simply reinforced
 feeling one start staff forecast first
 approximation, probably period odds
 coming less would usually say true staff
 forecast and, therefore, one needs somewhat adroit
 alert changing policy fact incoming information
 suggestive--
 
 MR. STOCKTON. isn't case forecast
 constrained particular feature model--that somehow
 energy price run-up would naturally lead offsetting price
 output effects unchanged nominal income. pointed
 briefing, function parameters specific
 model theoretical feature economy something
 anything summary past historical experience.
 MR. PARRY. seems made one major judgment
 interest rates lower, feeling
 shouldn't take much confidence result. seems
 quite likely make judgment we're probably,
 effect, going see higher nominal income it's probably going
 primarily result greater inflation. think risk
 it's significant risk.
 MR. PRELL. think sense nominal GNP
 concept attractive sort automatic stabilizer.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. don't necessarily constrain
 automatic response. So, there's nothing magical
 this.
 concerned acceleration inflation

 even--
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Oh, that's true.
 
 MR. PRELL. doesn't work terms

 MR. PARRY. may cast somewhat
 [unintelligible] way indeed underlying relationships
 different portrayed model. you're right:

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Don, project M2 growth
 fourth quarter given something like baseline assumption?
 
 8/21/90
 
 -35-
 
 MR. KOHN. 4 percent quarterly average growth
 fourth quarter. believe monthly numbers, don't
 right front me, lower that. come third
 quarter higher, think we're looking rates like 3-1/2
 percent monthly basis fourth quarter. partly
 RTC activity picking end September,
 starts depressing M2 growth early fourth quarter.
 opportunity costs perhaps even widening little
 banks thrifts reduce offering rates lagged response
 rates. So, don't big push M2 fourth
 quarter. raise projection year 4 percent based
 largely incoming data, revisions past data, saw
 third quarter. didn't really strengthen outlook beyond
 third quarter much.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody else?
 not, don't get
 started try cut this. must say
 difficult policy discussion ever confronted
 with, I've around policy woods speak 40
 years. Let's start are. think several
 things stipulate degree certainty: namely,
 argue already recession think
 reasonably certain wrong sense weekly
 data suggest, others mentioned, perhaps
 week ago evidence deterioration
 sluggish pattern. insured unemployment data broad
 set numbers economy whole.
 don't get revised. Sometimes little unstable,
 general give unfailing measure been.
 think first half third quarter
 clearly small plus. whole thing may fall face next
 week, think moment hasn't.
 inflation side, argue goods
 inflation suppressing problem services side clearly
 looking numbers [but] find numbers little difficult
 read. think crucial issue services inflation
 numbers wage rates which--however one looks inflation
 trade-off--clearly coming show slight upward
 tilt. Although still possibility could turn
 around third quarter, wouldn't want count given
 type environment we're in. services inflation problem
 lot tricky things it, think David Mullins
 raising--especially try substitute existing house prices
 cost house operations owner renter. So, it's
 mixed bag.
 saying, essentially, there's degree
 apparent certainty forecasts judgments, think
 suspect. crucial issue confronting us right moment
 odds actual war Middle East 50/50.
 look form buildup we're engaged there, it's
 fairly apparent military establishment
 going sit long period time. bringing
 fairly significant tactical offensive weapons. chances
 positioning nothing Saddam backing
 easily low side probability [spectrum].

 crucial issue war come,

 you're exuding reason focused on.

 focused essentially credit aggregates money

 indications markets tightening
 anticipated, hoped money supply numbers looking
 
 8/21/90

 down. recall, Bob Forrestal mentioned hearing less
 credit crunch may fact happening;
 may well money supply numbers recent weeks
 showing us cumulative pressure coming credit
 markets endeavor essentially preserve capital reached

 today's environment recognize

 everybody else's, down.
 control would strictly Gulf states
 terrorist groups control Indonesia
 every far flung oil producer world. Consequently, ability
 divert guy probably far implications respect
 crude oil output, prices, interest rates, world economy,
 specifically United States economy, anything
 sitting around table weeks.
 So, would suggest
 particular stage ought modest view
 we're going able accomplish.
 don't think

 I'd make three points.
 First, kind environment,

 don't think assume unchanged funds rate unchanged

 suggested remarks--I don't think pretend
 lead markets kind environment; really follow.
 Now, don't always buy markets volatile
 period, I'm suggesting unless expectations ease
 evidenced financial markets, would difficult us
 ease get away given concern inflation that's
 
 8/21/90
 
 -42-
 
 there. final point would make recession
 imminent--if we're going go recession fourth quarter--I
 don't think much right now. Even face
 weak incoming data, feel we're monetary policy course
 consistent long run sustainable growth
 progress toward price stability, that's do.

 worry overreacting--not part general--to
 incoming weak data thought somehow could pull
 economy recession short run. don't think can.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Well, instinct intuition tilt toward
 ease sooner rather later. cautionary comments
 made persuade that, long monitor situation
 carefully closely prepared move quickly,
 recommendation appropriate. join supporting it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, fully support
 recommendation "B" asymmetric toward ease, I'm sure
 mind really locked eventual ease.
 think
 may surprised strength economy.
 also think
 contemplate ease, we're going assess
 carefully make sure efficacious ease.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. also would support
 formulation.
 It's probably fair say case prior
 Iraqi developments, would leaned easing event.

 things stand right now, probably would come fairly close
 associating Mr. Boehne's definition situation.
 also think it's uncertain could easily go way.
 could easily envision unpleasant circumstances might
 tighten monetary policy. say favor that,
 captures range emotions think really
 table. say, formulation fine things
 sit right now. would lean toward Mr. Boehne's prescription,
 depending upon happens might lot cautious
 seeking opportunity ease.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Mr. Monhollon.
 
 MR. MONHOLLON. think there's serious risk
 ease now, might misread public
 markets.
 might decrease credibility might produce sharp
 negative reactions domestic bond markets foreign exchange
 markets.
 might make longer-run objectives difficult
 costly achieve.
 So, strong preference "B," Mr.
 Chairman reasons addition ones you've outlined.
 don't strong feeling symmetry question,
 
 slight preference symmetry.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
