 MR. PRELL. Right. Well, think it's fraction

 Implicitly, given changes we've made time

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, there's one way coming
 slightly different manner. data come

 collateral requirements increased spreads loans open

 That's issue raising.
 I'd like to, it's

 MR. PARRY. Don't get wrong; don't think you're
 understating events.
 wondered it, that's
 all.

 MR. MELZER. Mike, Chart 9, alternative fiscal

 MR. PRELL. Well, longer term, perhaps one begins look

 MR. MELZER. One question respect rates:
 occasioned dramatic change assumption path
 
 interest rates meeting prior meeting?
 MR. PRELL. Several things involved. One fact
 near term economy seems weaker underlying
 sense anticipated previously. second factor
 decision make fiscal policy bit restrictive 1991. top
 that, already brought interest rate bulge down;
 thought rates would going spiking first part 1991

 MR. MELZER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mike, area
 budget, leaving aside RTC-type things, could give
 sense sensitivity [1991] budget deficit estimate
 economic assumptions? [the effect difference of] 1
 percentage point GNP 1 percent unemployment [rate]
 something like actual budget deficit excluding-MR. PRELL.
 give you, example, CBO's rule
 thumb. one percent change real growth starting beginning
 year yields--if take lower growth scenario--$7 billion
 first year.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. PRELL.

 much?
 
 It's $7 billion first year $26 billion
 real output primary focus?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. trying ask this:
 Looking earlier charts page 3 differences 1991
 staff numbers Administration numbers GNP,
 unemployment, etc., make rough ballpark guess,
 translate terms budget deficit?
 MR. PRELL. 1991, would take fairly sizable
 difference one builds difference interest rate
 assumptions. example, Treasury bill rate 1991--these
 
 7/2-3/90
 
 published numbers yet--is average 6.8 percent.
 that's
 little lower forecast entails.
 Looking across board
 that's probably worth somewhere $5 $10 billion; don't
 know particular phasing. add output path
 difference, would think we're running difference something
 $10 $20 billion area terms economic assumptions.
 Inflation differences small; projections aren't
 sensitive inflation differences. Clearly, small potatoes
 relative aspects [unintelligible] deliberations.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Yes, thought.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. Somewhat related Jerry's question: likely
 it, Congress goes expenditure cuts budget higher
 taxes, actually would produce larger deficit
 impact fiscal restraint would slow growth even further?
 MR. PRELL. Well, simulation suggests it's within
 powers monetary policy offset [expected] drag.
 might
 take aggressive action, believe models, it's doable.
 guess that's most-MS.
 
 SEGER.
 
 think timing would work
 
 that?
 MR. PRELL. Mechanically, models say this.

 guess say, follow earlier question 1991
 budget deficits, wasn't really building differences
 1990 forecast, would start things little worse
 widen gap.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. growth output think [depends
 on] judgment when, example, tax increases occur

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Sure.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know date well

 we'll judgment fiscal tax results.
 Now,

 MS. SEGER. second question relates thought
 heard say talking housing starts. believe
 said thought credit availability problems
 builders one-shot phenomenon. hope that's true, I'm
 sure.
 MR. PRELL. Well, tried say two conceptually separate
 things. One extent lowers activity, that's
 one-time effect.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL. That's one-time effect, growth path
 pursued determined subsequent interest rate income
 movements well. thing extent

 shut loan-to-one-borrower restrictions

 That's one big "if."

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, balance economy
 District largely unchanged last meeting: mixed
 stable, least moderate level. Clearly, sectors
 weaker. Retail sales must say anecdotally
 hearing June sales really soft compared
 last June.
 Construction activity down, residential
 nonresidential; yet numbers think still running ahead
 national numbers. Chicago purchasing managers report came
 day; June bit May. Production, new
 manufacturing sector
 orders, order backlogs lower.

 generally unchanged, areas better.
 steel business, example, year moving along,
 shipments level increased. started year
 thinking would 80 million ton year. Now, numbers
 high 84 million tons--a little lower last year,
 still comparatively good year. Operating levels, least

 high level, operating 98 percent.
 that, awful lot capacity come paper business and,
 therefore, pricing very, intense. Liner board, example,
 manufacturing

 sector, surprisingly, agricultural equipment strong;
 production levels 5 percent higher year last year.
 Sales agricultural equipment retailers moving good
 pace.
 Construction machinery, though, weak; response
 decrease construction activity, category down.
 auto sector continues very, uncertain;
 sales level May early June certainly weak
 consequence forecast year beginning pulled
 bit.
 One company's forecast little 14-1/2 million

 pricing side, outlook positive

 raw materials prices stable down. One large manufacturer
 talked says firm's raw materials costs

 Finally, regard
 hear good news raw materials side.
 credit crunch, banks talk saying
 certainly careful approach credit lending.
 lending very, carefully, everybody says
 enough credit good credits. And, course,
 would emphasize word "good."
 briefly, national context--and think view
 reflective District outlook--we little
 positive Board staff past continue
 so.

 So, total horizon forecast

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, start with,
 forecast continues very, similar Mike's forecast
 terms GNP inflation. minor differences around
 edges really quite small. insofar kind
 bias [unintelligible] around forecast concerned, associate
 comments Mr. Boehne made opening
 discussion. is, somebody put gun head said
 "You put forecast down," that's forecast would put
 down. don't think I'd quite confidence
 forecast would three four months ago--again,
 reasons Ed Boehne mentioned. Anecdotally,
 aspects consensus forecast look pretty good.
 Certainly, impression get export sector still
 quite strong, quite similar Ted's forecast even bit

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, something I'm looking
 mistake it. Governor Seger.
 MS. SEGER. Well, like everybody else here, think it's
 great long-range thinker strategist. I'm also looking
 backward 6 years first Humphrey-Hawkins meeting attended
 1984. remind folks, M2 range 6 9 percent
 brought 3 7 percent, quite
 significant change. actual M2 growth ran 7.7 percent 1984
 estimating around 3-1/2 percent year. think
 that's significant. Also, ranges moved
 consistently; haven't popping around like popcorn,
 think that's good also. M3 went 6 9 percent range
 now, 2-1/2 6-1/2 percent, actual
 growth went 10-1/2 percent estimated 1.1 percent
 year. I'm mentioning
 significant amount squeezing liquidity economy
 period. So, pointed looking ahead
 respect strategies, I'm baseline strategy supporter.
 due respect forecasters, I'm convinced, looking
 5 years additional inflation relief would get going
 tighter route, it's worth taking chance on. realize
 that's value judgment; it's way feel. I'm also
 convinced tightening policy generate greater growth
 1995. So, would go strategy I.
 terms ranges 1990, I've never supported
 changing ranges middle year; don't think it's

 good idea.
 believe ought set idea

 So, would

 instead dismissing
 [shortfall] technicality RTC activities, think big
 part credit crunch story here. Maybe ought look
 ask whether satisfied 1 percent
 increase M3 1990.
 many people Hill continuing
 get letters unhappy constituents, might asking
 question similar one.
 So, would support keeping
 ranges year established earlier. 1991,
 also would keep ranges main reason
 another crack February. lot uncertainties
 velocity economy general--the RTC activities
 whole lot things.
 Therefore, there's something said
 hanging existing ranges then, six
 months' additional information knowledge, we're
 adjust next Humphrey-Hawkins meeting. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let make general comment first,
 cannot quite shake feeling may
 something going that's little real. Even
 discussion RTC represents something real;
 represents prior period heck lot
 bad debt created financial system. So, it's kind
 accounting change. keep toying mind
 perhaps small possibility going phase
 retrenchment financial system, symbolized
 RTC slow growth bank credit slowdown overall
 debt, something quite real something need even
 transitory. look great bulk experience recent
 years, substantial disconnection, example,

 growth debt economy growth GNP.
 turns lot disconnection reflects fact
 lot debt bad debt.
 It's showing RTC bank
 write-offs junk bond write-offs, etc.
 So, may something
 goes beyond so-called transitory factors.
 tend take rather eclectic view Ms,
 struck even Mr. Kohn can't explain, matter hard
 tries, sizable part shortfall M2 second quarter.
 So, again, I'm quite sure fully grasp, least
 fully grasp, that's going relationships.

 reason think bit cautious
