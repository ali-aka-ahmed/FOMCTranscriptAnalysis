 MR. STERNLIGHT.

 MR. HOSKINS. one question, perennial one.
 Given changes gone consideration
 potentially reducing reserve requirements well, going
 collateral problem soon?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. dewarehousing Sam referred
 noted relieves immediate concern. think could still
 run problem early next year. came close days
 recent period--closer expected slow
 growth money and, hence, reserve requirements.
 dewarehousing gave us breathing space. don't really look
 tight squeeze maybe February.
 MR. KOHN. projections, President Hoskins, actually
 us squeezing February little breathing room; I'm
 sure Peter's. case dewarehousing--and
 obviously depending happens dollar reserve
 requirements not--that reserve requirements reduced
 policy move, something would done using
 foreign currency holdings. don't enough space move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Si.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Bluebook comment
 Japanese banks borrowing overnight fact [such
 borrowing] apparently doesn't impact domestic rate.
 I'm quite clear works.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. think comment

 MR. STERNLIGHT. various reasons it;

 That's even bizarre.
 
 MR. KOHN. used pay more, even before,

 difference interest rates, effect fed funds rate,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Peter, lot discussion
 concerning Japanese foreign investors pulling back
 investments, particularly indirect investments, United

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think pulling back

 That's another sensitive question, think

 Governor Kelley.
 
 11/13/90
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, agree two options
 mentioned two best ones: either
 nothing delete sentence. anachronism now;
 anachronism long time.
 don't see compulsion

 intensely aware discussing given fact
 Fed many ways center scrutiny concern
 fragilities.
 I've heard hue cry part

 MR. BLACK. Mike, absence objections might

 MR. KEEHN. sentence really longer

 it's

 signs would suggest recession relatively mild
 don't imbalances inventories haven't
 spike interest rates.
 also suggests maybe make
 
 progress inflation. staff mentioned, number
 pieces good news there. think it's instructive commodity
 prices still show real signs taking off. indices
 follow lower last week, last month, even last
 year take energy prices. So, given increasing
 slack economy, maybe we're making progress there, although
 probably would take quite months convince us
 really made progress. It's better going
 opposite direction.
 tend agree sentiment number people
 real problem credit markets. I'm concerned
 investment grade companies get credit. We've seen widening
 spreads; default rates corporate bonds think
 they're going continue rise, especially big bulk junk
 bonds ages gets age default rates typically go up.
 true, Tom Melzer mentioned, see people going

 wonder, though, whether channels sufficient meet

 Another thing Peter mentioned what's going happen

 So, look across broad range

 terms monetary aggregates see
 seven months M2 grown little less 3 percent.
 So,
 tend believe monetary policy remained reasonably tight
 full [1990] period. Going fourth quarter 1989
 it's still 4 percent; M2 growth 7 percent fourth
 quarter 1989 6-1/2 percent first quarter 1990.
 average together last six seven months--maybe that's still
 long enough--even take components M2 together,
 aggregate growing rapidly. So, look
 it, agree projection mild downturn; also agree
 there's great risk downturn could become much severe
