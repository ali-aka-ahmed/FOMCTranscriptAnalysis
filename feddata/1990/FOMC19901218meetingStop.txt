 Committee last meeting.
 MS. SEGER. Gretchen, I've always wanted know much
 activity foreign exchange market involves corporate
 positioning opposed traders work money center banks.

 know many multinational corporations get involved

 sense proportion would fall out?
 MS. GREENE. That's difficult question answer,
 partly don't good statistics partly
 concept hard define. last conducted turnover
 survey, 1989, ask banks tell us proportion
 total foreign exchange turnover customers.
 I've forgotten

 corporate customer. Nonbank financial institutions could customers
 also.
 rest business bank does, although it's
 reported interbank business, may support customer's
 business.

 Yes.
 
 actually determining number?
 It's monetary policy matter.
 

 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, banks make individual
 decisions this; it's question levels feel
 comfortable with. We've spoken money center banks
 reviewing reduction reserve

 Several considering establishing

 MR. SYRON.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. PARRY. I'm wondering funds rate going

 MR. KOHN. indicated Bluebook, think would
 produce little uncertainty.
 agree completely Peter
 technical perspective could execute policy either way,
 particularly pay lot attention funds rate
 lot less attention borrowing used to.
 think
 putting funds rate discount rate would raise question
 
 12/18/90
 
 minds whether gone penalty discount rate.
 also would raise questions newspapers reported
 preferences within Fed that. So, think
 see that, would waiting discount rate
 change. would raise bit uncertainty it's certainly
 completely doable technical perspective. would perhaps lead
 small increase federal funds rate volatility, small.
 MR. KEEHN. Peter, think maybe answered
 question, let go back again. year-end
 issue, keep hearing capital level constraints
 year year-end pressures going particularly tough.
 saying case [unintelligible] bit?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Certainly, concern still there.
 seemed reach peak end November came off.
 last couple days we've seen move back
 near panicky feeling seemed November. awful
 lot preparation undertaken year-end cases we're
 hearing institutions prepared able, within
 limits, take credits year-end think
 find good business opportunities that. So,
 point anyway, I'm looking terrible looming problem,
 it's certainly something we're going keep close watch
 right year-end.
 MR. GUFFEY. Peter, don't think understand Japanese

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think provided mainly

 Gretchen would want comment too--there greater
 reluctance among U.S. banks extend lines Japanese banks
 extent before, even though U.S. banks
 downgraded regarded less favor, Japanese banks.

 say, smaller U.S. banks would funds provide

 MR. HOSKINS. Peter, think alluded somewhat--maybe
 misread you--to idea day-to-day operations it's
 little difficult signal are, given reserve
 requirement change. I'm wondering view
 opportunity get little variability funds rate
 get back toward reserve borrowing approach. course,
 would require discount rate moved choose
 operate way. opportunity?
 
 12/18/90
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. don't really see way
 think low level borrowing.
 don't really good substitute put place focus
 funds rate. anything, go transition
 period reserve requirements, think we're going
 lean even funds rate. really don't see good
 alternative that.
 MR. HOSKINS. Maybe ought signal explicitly
 tell market funds rate [objective] is.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Well, it's coming darn close that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Peter? not,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Comments?
 
 MR. PARRY. Ted, I'd like follow bit comments
 net exports. decline GNP fourth quarter
 staff Greenbook $32 - $33 billion
 improvement net exports $30 billion. improvement
 look highly unlikely, given October number. usually don't
 reversals, though could something aberration.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, could be. may noticed
 last year similar aberration October, think
 misplaced seasonal factors work data. Obviously,
 go back forecast given data
 morning, might somewhat smaller swing. However, much
 swing coming oil phenomenon pretty
 good data going early part December that. might
 note oil number that's table higher
 projected quantity value, largely
 found oil New York harbor hadn't included
 previous months. strip out, sharp drop-off
 
 12/18/90
 
 quantity oil, stripped GNP account,
 sharp drop-off volume oil imports, get valued
 1982 prices.
 So, that's going big statistical impact
 current quarter.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Let add: oil ships!
 
 MR. PARRY.
 improvement order maybe
 half forecast here, could talking decline
 1 2 percent annual rate forecast.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. PRELL. time sort data
 detail try match various expenditure
 categories, think one needs emphasize GNP measures
 domestic production.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL.
 Indeed, last Wednesday went
 press Greenbook, didn't even retail sales data, etc.
 depending considerable extent labor market data
 get sense input domestic production
 trying make reasonable guesses, effect,
 productivity forth. think one leap
 conclusion dollar-for-dollar surprise net exports would
 track GNP.
 may find stronger expenditures capital
 goods, example, match imports adjustment.
 may luxury cars imported, part
 bulge consumption fourth quarter.

 case, rather coming inventories, might
 implications first quarter.
 So, think it's complex
 process one needs go data.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, assume since PCE
 October higher originally estimated imports higher
 may seeing nothing higher level imports
 consumer goods?
 MR. TRUMAN. Every category actually up; one
 particular thing point to. Automobiles substantially
 may luxury car phenomenon. consumer goods also
 substantially, capital goods too.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 said PCE October, right?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Yes.
 
 I'm sorry;
 
 meant November.
 
 [Unintelligible.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions gentlemen?
 not, think we'll start around table.
 MR. BLACK. Mr.

 think
 
 Chairman, obviously uncertain

 One big

 revision staff made net exports goods services

 we've gotten merchandise trade balance October--though
 lot may wash Ted suggested. Despite things,

 magnitude revision looks little big us.
 second reason persistent weakness M2, don't think
 anybody really explain satisfactorily. continues worry us
 great deal. finally, we've impressed continued
 strong negative tone anecdotal information we've
 getting sorts sources. One piece information
 struck particularly impressive came

 MR. BLACK. happened last month. Now, feel
 somewhat comfortable staff's inflation forecast

 earlier, really think monetary restraint put

 mild projecting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, best

 say Dallas District it's pretty flat.
 statistical evidence saying confirmed
 board directors meeting last Thursday anecdotal
 information we've getting lately. increasingly
 difficult find segment District economy

 slight gains. Manufacturing activity weak, particularly
 electronics defense-related industries. Construction activity
 picked slightly, pickup represents completion

 retailers telling us Christmas season slow,
 merchandise moving except post-Christmas-type discounts.
 Overall, outlook District economy little
 growth next months.

 take issue Mike's forecast, particularly since added somewhere
 along line risks certainly side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, economy Twelfth District

 region. California economy, accounts twothirds District's employment, slowed along nation.
 look employment, happened since August

 growth remains 1/2 point national average.
 surprisingly, slowdown pronounced trade,
 construction, manufacturing, year-over-year declines

 remainder District, however, rather interesting
 developments. effects national slowdown,
 District's manufacturing employment outside California

 trade employment 4.3 3.6 percent, respectively.
 Residential real estate sales volumes certainly
 California, Hawaii, Washington fairly sizable way-believe not--in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Nevada. Home prices
 continue rise except Seattle coastal California areas,
 which, course, represent substantial part
 District. agricultural outlook, important us
 measures single largest industry
 District, quite bright. USDA points particularly strong
 production export performance region's fruits, vegetables,
 specialty crops.
 may turn briefly national outlook:
 current quarter see real GNP declining rate 4 5
 percent, bit stronger falloff projected
 Greenbook. must admit can't point particular
 quantifiable factor would causing degree weakness.
 It's obvious, example, oil shock enough produce
 kind falloff. best guess we'll see small rate
 decline first quarter, similar Greenbook,
 followed pickup second half year much along

 lines Greenbook, including improved exports.
 appear us underlying inflation rate may peaked
 unemployment rate rise we're likely see
 moderate progress area next year so.

 projections inflation, however, somewhat higher

 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, far national
 economy concerned, think Dick Syron made point earlier.

 put forecast piece paper, I'd probably put one
 looks lot like one Mike put Greenbook.
 said that, reasons cited
 earlier, think risks second quarter 1991 beyond
 probably south side forecast. Indeed, looking
 Mike's forecast, economy behaving growth terms like
 forecast next seven quarters--while may cyclically
 less we've seen past--I'd consider terrific.
 Basically, 2-1/2 percent growth throughout balance 1991
 1992.
 Let say brief word local economy, New York
 metropolitan area particularly. Keeping mind manufacturing
 terms nowhere near important was, fact
 matter still something like 10 12 percent
 nation's population industries real estate it's
 disproportionately important even population would indicate.
 metropolitan area whole, clear white

 headlines see cutbacks financial firms. it's
 that.
 Indeed, white collar profile recessionary

 me. silver lining behind cloud credit crunch
 would describe pervasive evidence

 I'm sure we're yet, may getting
 closer suspect, especially rebuilding spreads
 margins proves somewhat durable.
 lot uncertainties. combination,
 Gary Dick several others said earlier, real estate
 sector vulnerabilities impact financial sector
 probably biggest single source uncertainty see
 right now.
 I've said let emphasize again:
 natural tendency focus commentary financial concerns
 banking system; see problems every bit acute
 cyclical structural terms nonbank sectors
 financial system banking system. Indeed,
 yesterday looking broad cross section data
 insurance industry, top bottom. tell you,
 pretty grim stuff, put mildly.
 anecdotally real estate situation, spent
 morning last week Bob Boykin Dallas directors
 tending convince Texas turned
 corner. Maybe Houston has, one

 construction business telling thought 10
 20 million square feet newly constructed office space Dallas
 area would better bulldozed. say $100 square
 foot take midpoint estimate 10 20 million,
 that's $1-1/2 billion worth new construction place go.
 So, again, wild cards think real estate-as reflects directly economy, along lines Gary's
 comments, also reflects problems financial
 side--is biggest single wild card.

 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. you'll know, I'm crying
 outlook virus eye. Last night
 reviewing staff forecast one time reminded
 something childhood. Although long time ago
 remember things it! mother always read every
 night strong preference stories "they lived

 forecast. really love ones positive, optimistic,
 that's
 happy. So, problem [with forecast].
 would remind beginning year,
 soft landing scenario marvelous accomplished
 goals pain, strain, sweat, terrific.
 sounded good true discovered
 things sound good true often problem.
 forecast isn't [unintelligible] scenario, still isn't dismal
 forecast. hope Greenbook turns right.
 I'll mention questions numbers,
 even though, said, hope Mike's staff's assumptions
 target rather mine.
 First all, really sense whatever we're
 now--I call recession--it's going longer serious
 Greenbook suggests. One thing I'm concerned
 consumption. know, I've taking dismal view
 auto industry months now, think
 concerns [now] rather evident public large. don't
 see going turn around really quickly. Also,
 consumption arena concerned nature layoffs
 we're seeing around country; it's Joe line

 people still working.
 Also, deterioration confidence. I'm
 state confidence usually negative state's economy
 cyclical, I'm used lack confidence nervousness
 that. I've never seen anything like I'm seeing now.
 I'm confining remarks Michigan all; it's widespread
 impacting ordinary individuals feeling
 something isn't right. don't necessarily know that's
 wrong, feel uncomfortable. know it's nice
 assume that's fallout Saddam Hussein higher
 gasoline prices worries availability oil, sense

 afternoon whatever takes solve problem done,
 would go away completely. Also, don't hear much it,
 real problem consumer debt load. used nag
 researchers looking consumer debt load told
 two sides balance sheet okay--that assets
 building time debt load was, forget it.
 problem now, least lot individual consumers.
 think delinquency loan write-off data suggest
 that. fact Sunday night happened TV one

 PB evangelists came wife announcing January

 Now, says something me:

 Also, hit much higher taxes

 substantially higher tax hikes pike. saw lot tax
 hikes 1990 believe we're going see still 1991

 budgetary problems.
 So, feel concerned
 consumption side going weaker we're assuming.
 Housing gone rapidly. We're
 back 1981-82 recession--depression part
 world. That's already.
 seems socalled credit crunch especially tough arena;
 centered home builder, Mrs. Jones needs get
 mortgage buy house.
 It's financing person wants
 build darn thing. Again, hope I'm negative
 don't see what's that's going turn credit
 availability problem around really soon kinds folks.

 I'm right that's big constraint, don't know what's going
 turn around.
 exports, would repeat Jerry said.

 think opportunities 1991 look little less robust.

 think shape economies major trading
 partners Canada, already serious recession,
 makes agree folks business. Also,
 realize we're running sort war Middle East, think
 still defense cuts coming through,
 impact places like sunny California already

 think really unique time, though--to borrow term

 throughout land.
 It's hitting individuals consumers also
 businessmen women. Personally, life time, never

 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, one advantages waiting

 everything pretty much said. can't resist
 opportunity make comment two Greenbook forecast.
 seems oil major wild card forecast. I'm
 uncomfortable assumptions either situation going
 stabilize Middle East get better, would bring oil
 prices keep down. seems important part
 recovery [forecast].
 might useful special
 case alternative forecast might suggest would
 happen hostilities Middle East Saudi
 production capacity damaged fashion would
 create, example, oil price $40 barrel keep
 while. think would significantly prolong timing
 recovery. wild card, seems me, credit
 crunch, think except comments around table
 dismissed rather casually. yet least one part
 country credit paralysis affecting whole economy
 shows signs reversal. think serious impairment
 spreading East coast. Bankers clearly worried
 scared certainly unwilling lend major parts
 country. consumers worried. Messrs. Littan, Brumbaugh,
 Seidman media best raise worry
 level sheer terror. think terror relates consumer
 attitudes toward banks toward investment spending getting
 debt. since consumer-driven economy,
 it's hard see rapid upturn consumer attitudes
 changed. best guess would consumer attitudes
 change significantly Middle East situation

 think underlying

 factors addressed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Finally, Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, guess I'm last leaf
 bush there's certainly little left said
 current conditions, Governor LaWare remarked. would
 like try resurrect perspective first offered, probably
 little prematurely, year ago underlying longerterm thrust what's going here.
 seems may
 seeing first downturn may rather powerful
 long-lived deflationary era--a sea change, will.
 think
 there's considerable evidence underlying that.
 worldwide basis
 almost commodities abundant: food, materials, heaven knows
 country built space, labor.
 Capital seek low cost
 labor mobile enough get put production place

 seems monetary policy tight
 control time; there's much problem sight
 there. Hopefully, fiscal policy turning around. Maybe
 important thing economy-wide basis country
 think we've gone era creating debt, inflationary,

 don't think done

 lot things--monetary, economic, political,

 true, implications view everything.

 true, may stickier short-term situation--a little slower in.
 near term come recession, far positive
 longer-term outlook time goes along come out.
 converse would we're another episode we've
 seen postwar era.
 turns true,
 could wind quick, weak recovery fall back rather

 MR. KOHN. 50 basis point decrease funds rate--now
 quarterly average, won't show way would

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 It's four times quarterly rate.
 
 MR. KOHN. Dave handed note: elasticity after,
 say, four five months .08 .09.
 MR. MULLINS. empirically works well.
 impression theoretical models much lower elasticity.
 MR. KOHN. Well, think case lot depends
 offering rates adjust market interest rates.
 adjustment drives lot; elasticities lower time
 offering rates adjust market rates.
 time--after couple years--you get low elasticities.
 assumption offering rates, adjusting
 perhaps faster would thought couple years ago
 market rate moving presume banks don't want [to
 attract deposits], would still adjust sluggishly.
 well.
 
 MR. MULLINS. past model fit data pretty
 stop fitting data pretty well?
 
 MR. KOHN. second quarter year. Well,
 that's quite fair response. We've large errors

 Okay.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. Don, surprise, I'm going ask
 alternative C today. question.
 MS. SEGER.

 MR. HOSKINS. started early, Martha. want followup couple questions already raised.
 pretty rapid growth--accelerating growth--in January, February,
 March. quarter finishes 7.6 percent. guess that's
 really David [raising].
 press on: happens
 next quarter? expect us go back 6 percent growth rate
 5 percent lower?
 MR. KOHN.
 
 terms alternative A?
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Yes, adopted alternative A.
 
 MR. KOHN. 6 7 percent range, think. would
 still increment would otherwise.
 guess would would like 7 percent.
 MR. HOSKINS. So, we'd pretty strong first half, 6
 percent something like that? seems we'd giving
 gains--
 
 MR. KOHN. think could kind growth. I'll
 try little clearer here. assuming upward
 shift velocity continues--a downward shift money demand--so
 we're sort going base. alternative A, say,
 give us 125 150 basis points [since] past summer.
 Before, would expected much rapid growth second
 quarter next year weren't shift. models,
 fact, projecting growth around 6-1/2 percent first
 quarter; instead 2-3/4 percent growth. So,
 increment, that's relative fourth quarter
 already coming down. So, still get trajectory going up.
 couple percentage points shaved would
 expected second quarter.
 MR. HOSKINS. instead, alternative
 6 percent money growth first half year,
 somewhere range. 5 percent first quarter
 7 percent second.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. couple weeks away
 evidence started yet. So, careful
 forecast.
 MR. HOSKINS. Well, we've concerned model

 MR. KOHN. We're trying number experiments using yield

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black, first.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, looking P* model
 shown Chart 9 and, read that, provides pretty
 good comfort level. Don, take much comfort that?
 MR. KOHN. problem, President Black, rests
 assumption equilibrium velocity level is.
 think discussion had-MR. HOSKINS.
 
 Clarifies it.
 
 MR. KOHN. Occasionally, doubts whether
 return V* that-MR. BLACK.
 
 Well, long run pretty darn
 
 stable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't know anything contradicts
 
 it.
 
 MR. BLACK.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. KOHN. We're beginning accumulate quarters
 tend move away, far certainly don't long-run
 evidence moved away. velocity return
 old pattern get M2 growth--so
 Committee didn't compensate M2 growth velocity
 shifted back--then you'd get pattern prices.
 MR. BOEHNE. discount rate go 1/2
 point Committee wanted funds rate go 25 basis
 points, difficult would communicate market,
 given fact haven't done much past given
 normal churning goes year-end? might take
 occur may find situation
 to--.
 guess miscommunication risk I'm driving at.
 MR. KOHN. Peter may want answer well,
 thought really two instruments that. One
 press release.
 
 decision Committee
 
 12/18/90
 
 -31-
 
 Board separately arrived [a decision cut discount rate]
 somehow coordinated that, could hint--without necessarily saying
 funds rate drop 1/4 point--that it's partly catch
 previous decreases market interest rates.
 would
 broad hint could play wording give best
 possible clue press release. think would take
 couple operations Mr. Sternlight thereafter make clear.
 dropped funds rate Committee wanted
 to, bring reserves pretty aggressive
 way. Now, think you're right churning around year-end
 problem; view we're going something,
 probably ought next couple days get
 done pretty well even keel
 potentially difficult period around year-end. don't see
 can't done next days.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. would agree conveyed.

 think something like move number people
 market expect. would also help able convey [an
 intention] like that.
 MR. BLACK.
 this, don't think would provide
 undue degree surprise, you?
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 MR. BLACK.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 surprise?
 
 No.
 
 That's way read it.
 didn't anything?
 
 Would
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. think people looking action
 necessarily immediately. nothing done going well
 January, let's say, think would element disappointment
 market.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Wayne, first.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Yes, Don, wanted comment. course,
 problem occurs Federal Open Market Committee moving
 away borrowing targeting thereby take away
 separation discount rate decision, Board
 Governors decision recommendations Reserve Bank boards
 factor.
 Federal Open Market Committee really
 choose fed funds target precisely--if said want 7
 percent, say--then circumstances monetary
 power left Board Governors Reserve Bank District
 boards we'd normally see.
 long maintain charade
 borrowing targeting separation function still
 there, seems me. is, long write FOMC minutes
 based upon charade borrowing old practice still
 there.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 
 recommending that?
 
 MR. ANGELL. Well, don't want get discussion
 discount rate.
 argue sides that.
 
 -32-
 
 12/18/90
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 You'd to!
 
 [Laughter.]
 
 think discussion ought
 
 recognize might desirable--that is, Committee
 Board may wish consider maintaining policy wipe
 distinction we've historically used. would
 kind change [unintelligible].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Peter, made point thought
 market might expecting something like 1/2 point discount
 rate 25 basis points initially funds rate. find
 overall approach fairly attractive. I'd like ask Gretchen:
 generally neighborhood what's expected exchange
 markets well?
 MS. GREENE. think it's fair say exchange
 markets distinction discount rate federal
 funds rate may quite widely appreciated. symbolic
 influence discount rate probably carries greater weight
 exchange markets domestically simply exchange
 market looks lots central banks discount rate
 many central banks important policy instrument. So, might
 take little exchange markets come
 interpretation domestic market action.
 MR. SYRON. Would comfort, use
 term, exchange markets would conveyed sort
 press release talked about?
 MS. GREENE. look press release and, sure,
 anything could comforting press release would help.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Don, think would take get
 prime rate come down?
 MR. KOHN. don't know. grand debate
 writing Bluebook whether something like would take
 prime rate down. us felt come hell high water banks
 probably wouldn't first January. think
 another easing something symbolic discount rate might
 pry people loose even year-end. easing
 mind would raise odds very, high level prime
 rate come year-end. issue whether might
 reduce sometime next two weeks. discount rate change
 might [the trick] focusing attention it. think
 almost certainly--he says hesitatingly!--would happen point
 first year. would still leave unusually wide
 spread funding costs, assuming CD rates came pari passu
 funds rate. margins would still wide.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Roger.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. remember earlier comment, Peter,
 year-end positioning almost run course, right?
 
 12/18/90
 
 -33-
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT. think intensity pressures reached
 peak end November subsided. We've seen
 increase rates last couple days but--as see
 anyway--without sense stringency near panic seemed
 late November. wouldn't want say run
 course. think could still pressures you'd
 want monitor maybe deal way.
 MR. GUFFEY. Well, given that, question is: soon
 first year would see unwinding completed?
 I'm really driving whether delay discount rate action
 reduction funds rate first year,
 two weeks, roughly, given several days
 market would [not] operate event holidays.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, terms market looks for,
 think one critical things next employment report.
 believe comes January 3rd quite early January.
 looks weak haven't seen [easing] then,
 look quite disappointed don't see it.
 Normally, you'd expect year-end pressures unwind week
 turn year. added complication
 reserve requirement reduction banks respond
 respond response.
 MR. GUFFEY. guess suggesting since activity
 intense year past years might unwind
 quickly first year--in shorter period time.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 don't particular sense that.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? not, let
 get started fairly brief think we've covered
 lot ground morning put table major
 issues.
 think it's fairly clear stage type
 economic phenomenon we're looking something without parallel
 post-World War II period. sense balance sheet
 suppression, type we've mentioning. It's really quite
 interesting see process, essentially one
 values continue significant pressure. example, we're
 beginning see weakening residential real estate prices
 work way CPI owners' equivalent rent numbers,
 finally flattened out. Earlier data suggested
 numbers moved parallel; went line bit earlier
 year, probably statistical fluke. it's fairly clear
 we're beginning see disinflationary process going on,
 starting largely balance sheet structure businesses
 well financial system. think that's major element
 feeding basic price structure. looking
 assets side also assets affect prices prices
 affect wages, reversing usual type pattern. We're obviously
 also seeing significant weakening retail markets
 consequence fairly dramatic decline realized capital gains
 sale existing residences, started weak
 second quarter. And, although data fragmentary,
 move fourth quarter level existing home sales
 awfully low. think goodly part weakness consumer
 markets consumer psychology also reduction
 
 12/18/90
 
 -34-
 
 purchasing power--quite similar President Syron talking

 respect New England, much broader basis.
 psychology issue obviously becoming really quite pronounced.
 one argue substantial part balance sheet related
 asset related, coincidence decline Persian Gulf
 crisis clearly considerable part that. it's fairly
 apparent, irrespective one looking pattern
 economic activity works way back psychology
 action, seeing seizing forms credit
 availability. intermediation taken
 system large part savings loan shrinkage
 So, overall occurring,
 insubstantial stage.
 number said one sense it, fear [felt
 by] banks fear getting involved intermediation
 would
 process really putting big suppression things.
 suspect 2 percentage point difference getting
 growth M2 model may fact reflect something
 don't measure--namely, inclination individuals hold
 liquid deposits previous calculations presumed
 risk free.
 substantial [volume of] noncompetitive tenders
 [in Treasury auctions] obviously train year mere
 suggestion particular phenomenon.
 said that, severe recessionary
 basic
 pressures. recessions always end.
 requirement far policy concerned make certain
 maintain adequate liquidity system, especially conditions
 experiencing, also obviously look
 side this. point going come
 want make reasonably certain we're
 looking degree liquidity system brings
 [higher] inflation rates next downturn much quickly
 usual.
 So, think it's apparent fairly
 difficult next six months ahead.
 don't think there's particular
 short-term policy uncertainty. judgment hear
 general consensus around here, read correctly,
 money supply become extraordinarily restricted we're
 looking major credit contraction. fact
 prime rate hasn't moved indication extent that.
 think inclination ease bit here.
 I'm
 becoming convinced days go that, optimum
 policy would somehow bring funds rate [to generate]
 associated credit get economy somewhat
 balanced growth position point [short-term rates] could
 stay down, chances able implement becoming
 increasingly small.
 It's credible central bank can't
 print money; try print it, figurative terms,
 likely point we'll succeed beyond wildest
 dreams. would argue strongly get
 downside policy cushion here, namely make certain supply
 adequate credit system, think also prepared
 fact may, probably will, overdo it.
 point
 equations come right going required
 start pulling back, probably earlier might desirous
 so.
 So, would particular stage leave
 possibility may overdo it, would overly concerned
 provided aware sufficiently advance that's
 what's happening. difference credit aggregates,
 
 12/18/90
 
 -35-
 
 money supply, monetary base--all various financial
 elements interface--are moment
 inflationary concerns think rather substantial.
 long way go, I'm particularly concerned it.

 bottom line come is: think implied,
 discount rate table [for Board consideration] tomorrow.
 Board decide reduce rate line vast
 majority recommendations Reserve Banks, strikes
 perhaps partial accommodation 1/2 point reduction
 discount rate 1/4 point funds rate, bringing
 7-1/4 percent 7 percent, probably stage
 sensible policy option.
 Board chooses reduce
 discount rate, would still argue favor moving funds rate
 another 1/4 point 7 percent appropriate open market
 policies. would suggest done that,
 remain asymmetric toward ease.
 Comments?
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, I'm sympathetic you're
 saying, want sure we're maintaining best
 fine line.
 wonder could accommodate mean
 would voting alternative B symmetric toward ease,
 Chairman Committee would discretion
 intermeeting period, particularly sat Board
 Governors regard discount rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 could done way. I'm
 actually recommending FOMC act independently move.
 noted, it's technical question.
 MR. ANGELL. again, I'm thinking way policy
 runs run last several years period
 time Federal Open Market Committee balance power.
 is, periods interest rates increasing, ordinarily
 fed funds rate moves pressures put fed funds
 rate.
 sense Reserve Bank directors Board
 Governors standby policy. even [when rate is]
 way that's also case.
 Now, way point reached
 distance fed funds rate discount rate
 gets wide one willing allow kind subsidy,
 balance swings Reserve Bank directors Board
 Governors. someone convinces otherwise, would favor
 maintaining [balance].
 would favor FOMC saying
 point time direction interest rates downward
 largely rests boards directors Reserve Banks
 Board Governors.
 sense it's kind flip-flop.

 think ought hear debate question see there's
 better way it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, don't quickly put
 table let people comment. Bob Black first.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, formulated exactly would
 done. want express hope Board Governors
 wisdom suggested might tomorrow
 net effect would 1/4 point change federal funds rate.

 Board act, 1/4 point would want
 point.
 think 1/2-point move would things bond
 market foreign exchange market wouldn't like
 
 -36-
 
 12/18/90
 
 much. would seen throwing towel
 point.
 So, I'm 100 percent that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 [on inflation]
 

 
 President Parry.
 
 [Unintelligible], guess mainly
 MR. PARRY.
 would like
 Greenbook bit optimistic would be.
 seems process we've
 make two points, though.
 going recent months suggest high
 feel though
 likelihood overshoot point.
 view future confidence in.
 realize rather substantial lags terms
 policy changes effect. don't that,
 react primarily conditions see appear statistics,
 Secondly,
 think high likelihood overshoot.
 occur maybe even doesn't--and point
 certainly alluded to--I think need prepared
 reverse actions point rather promptly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 views Wayne Angell's
 
 comments?
 MR. PARRY.
 
 want think it.
 
 wanted get clarification Governor
 MR. HOSKINS.
 Angell. suggesting stay 7-1/4 percent asymmetric
 toward ease and, prejudge Board do, suppose
 lowers discount rate 50 basis points,
 passed through?
 signalling device?
 MR. ANGELL. No, suggesting asymmetry
 toward ease delegate Chairman decision whether
 full 50 points show 25 show through.
 I'm
 trying keep technical FOMC talking
 so-called pressure [existing] pressure fed funds rate
 discount rate. intermeeting period, given
 uncertainty FOMC Board do, Chairman
 would discretionary authority. Board chose
 move discount rate, Chairman could go ahead
 immediately move fed funds rate 25 basis points.
 So, I'm
 talking difference outcome terms Chairman
 suggesting; I'm talking technical manner.
 MR. SYRON.
 Board voted accept
 recommendation majority Reserve Banks, would
 expectation, use phrase, Chairman would do?
 MR. ANGELL. Well, think Chairman made clear
 would expect move fed funds rate.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 25 basis points maintain asymmetry toward
 
 MR. BLACK.
 
 might might used.
 
 MR. SYRON.
 
 Oh,
 
 ease?
 
 yes.
 
 12/18/90
 
 MR. ANGELL. I'm talking change outcome
 Chairman proposing.
 MR. HOSKINS. Let finish then. preference would
 change; could live asymmetric language. would
 agree Governor Angell's proposal: is, Board going
 change discount rate, first see happens.
 would opportunity, foreign exchange markets reacted
 badly that, sit move forward. seems
 give degrees freedom. overall preference-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. press release
 discount rate action, bind hands respect
 issue.
 MR. HOSKINS. No, I'm saying [unintelligible] you've
 lowered discount rate, say, 50 basis points, don't
 anything respect funds rate reaction-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. that, problem
 normal market expectation would 50 basis point decline
 funds rate, think want suggest. So,
 press release we're going say something effect
 expectation show partially funds
 rate.
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, think FOMC ought talk
 distance fed funds rate discount rate,
 ought advising us along boards directors.
 think Board Governors decide question.
 MR. LAWARE. I'm clear think must move
 lock step. disparate relationship long
 remember discount rate fed funds rate. We've
 operating two weeks least 1/4 point [spread
 two rates]. operated 300 basis points while. would
 assumption would drop amount?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 that's fact we've
 
 doing.
 MR. ANGELL. time we've moved discount rate, except
 September 3 1987, we've moved fed funds rate amount
 discount rate.
 MR. LAWARE. Well, don't know feel hands
 tied that.
 MR. BLACK. think could put news release
 decided sort thing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let put way. Let's
 first get policy seems little
 difference. we'll worry means implementation.
 viewed differently market affect
 minutes read implementation directive reads.
 won't affect anything else, let's make certain get
 
 -38-
 
 12/18/90
 
 agreement we're actually going hold minute
 question technically implemented. Bob Forrestal.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, respect
 policy issue start proposition we're contraction,
 contraction going continue, risk
 
 serious downturn present. risk kind downturn
 one would like take point. think it's
 undue downward risk, would prefer policy contracyclical
 think put finger
 point rather procyclical.
 important aspect downturn: psychology.
 psychology universally bad. Although monetary policy can't cure
 ills economy certainly can't deal
 Middle East on, think it's thing point-unless solution Middle East situation--that
 really going bolster psychology. So, risk
 overdoing it, would prepared run risk point.
 preference would move 50 basis points immediately; however,
 wanted two steps asymmetric directive,
 wouldn't great problem that. 50 basis points
 immediately, think extent technically solves
 discount rate problem funds rate would
 discount rate market would expecting symmetry
 two. preference terms policy implementation would
 move 50 basis points [on funds rate] drop discount
 rate well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. First all, support precisely
 recommendation put table. is, hope
 Board move discount rate 1/2 point, Committee trying
 settle funds rate around 7 percent--I question
 Mr. Sternlight friends engineer even
 year-end environment--and maintain asymmetry directive.
 know it's late, let make couple quick comments
 terms policy setting. think Martha made good point
 spoke soft landing. Everyone knew going
 difficult exercise. economy seems tipped
 recession. think it's important others keep
 mind indeed recession, causes seem
 [primarily] autonomous shift expectations growing part
 excesses past, credit crunch symptom,
 part Saddam Hussein. raise vestiges past,
 Per Jacobsson lecture Paul Volcker made point
 recession, it's going monetary policy's fault.
 think that's right. Moreover, achieve outcome like
 Mike's forecast, don't think it's end world long
 shot. addition, say couldn't say six months
 ago: there's least strong [hint] two suggests
 inflation outcome could better thought six short months
 ago. all, one likes recession, don't consider
 outcome terrible long shot long get something like
 Mike's forecast. that's worry bit, lot,
 money supply. one ever going accuse
 monetarist, see money supply, total reserves,
 whatever, kind red zone. circumstances
 think policy you're suggesting exactly right. Even
 
 12/18/90
 
 -39-
 
 policy I'm means convinced inevitably
 irreversibly destined overdo it.
 think squeeze through.
 quickly point Governor Angell raised,
 think goes well beyond communicate particular change:
 think Governor Angell raising difficult question
 whole matter relationships Board Governors
 boards directors one hand Open Market Committee

 must say, Wayne, looked long
 period time sides interest rate cycle, one

 reluctant change them. might add, risk seeming prod

 logical extension one crazy penalty

 MR. ANGELL.

 there's another side issue.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, might bad idea
 point sort fleshing [unintelligible] issue
 you're raising. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. accept recommendation funds

 think it's probably appropriate.

 expressed earlier use phrase heard elsewhere--that we're

 Unfortunately, don't confidence we'll

 12/18/90
 
 show open market operations tomorrow I'd inclined
 cut discount rate Friday. point I'd make
 clear it's simply technical adjustment move discount
 rate line rates. think communication
 scheme could get little confusing. think could establish
 7 percent funds rate Friday technical
 adjustment [in discount rate] use appropriate language
 that. I'm concerned Wayne's concern here. could left
 position Board decided move rate
 Wednesday would situation where, authority
 proposing delegate Chairman, would still
 funds rate coming close possibly discount rate.
 So, I'm troubled that. I'd go ahead open market
 operations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, would enthusiastically support
 recommendation, think absolutely right thing
 given current circumstances. Specifically, terms
 decision today, would reduce fed funds rate 25 basis
 points, asymmetric language, hope discount rate
 would reduced concurrently shortly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. STERN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. would support recommendation, Mr.
 Chairman. would also hope discount rate cut.
 comment would make hope would exercise
 considerable discretion going intermeeting
 period unless something unusual happens.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS. wanted finish policy statement
 separate discount rate issue. think ought
 asymmetric language. I'd rather 25 basis point move
 hands Chairman discretion. made
 significant moves terms interest rates recent past
 haven't seen fully show yet. Don's projections
 presumably could err sides, one side, may well
 get faster growth rate money. even projection
 have, 50 basis point move puts us top tentative
 target range next year June. seems
 patience needed careful watching aggregates.
 I'm averse moving aggregates pan
 26-week fluke. maybe ought see what's aggregate box
 move ahead.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, like suggestion exactly
 put. disagree Lee sense think
 FOMC ought do--I'm voting member--is vote make 25 basis

 true
 policy-induced recession. think that's important
 point.
 also responsibility take consideration
 world exists, think suggested without

 think it's important move
 ahead, must say feel Tom Melzer's concerns
 quickly we'll adjust, confessed asymmetric monetarist. may
 react quickly side.
 It's important FOMC

 getting things many conditions.

 many things permutations combinations--that

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. enthusiastically support move toward ease,
 tomorrow vote favor discount rate cut
 think one reasons lack confidence business
 communities feeling somehow lot people
 Washington don't know what's going on.
 think would kind

 wouldn't discreet one would know
 it, would something would fit front page

 I'm

 announcements starting 9:42 a.m.
 MR. SYRON.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 That's pretty precise!
 want bet?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 think Federal Open Market Committee ought vote 1/4 point
 reduction rate today asymmetrical directive,
 think colleagues ought tomorrow.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Governor LaWare.
 
 long it's right thing!
 
 MR. LAWARE.
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 thing I'd add feel quite strongly
 circumstances little chance particular policy
 directive would lead us overshoot mark.
 
 right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 regretfully suspect may
 
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 -42-
 
 12/18/90
 
 MR. MULLINS. support recommendation. think
 allowed fed funds rate come gradually fall
 rapidly recently market rates also fallen rapidly. We've
 yet see full impact M2. Still, M2 seems decelerating
 bit. think there's ample room continue least
 marginal decline. true I've seen Don's forecast
 errors one side, there's always possibility
 turn around.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 has.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 
 So, support recommendation.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Roger, remarks?
 
 MR. GUFFEY. would support recommendation, Mr.
 Chairman. would go one step further, however, given background
 reduced fed funds rate roughly 3/4 percentage
 point six-week period starting October 29 hasn't
 shown yet. Another 1/4 point doesn't bother me,
 continue concern overshooting also
 concern moving fed funds rate level discount
 rate making discount rate penalty rate. would feel lot
 comfortable recommendation indeed assured
 Board would act rather promptly reduce discount rate
 half it, 1/4 point, would show through.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 might say technically--
 
 MR. GUFFEY. don't see standing ceremonies,
 think Wayne Angell brought forth distinction
 Board FOMC. time set policy I'd like see
 established here.
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, would like comment
 monetary policy question rather technical one spoke
 earlier. position exactly identical Tom
 Melzer's. quite months rather unpleasant news
 ahead us. anyone illusion
 going pressures reduce fed funds rate discount
 rate January, February, March--.
 seems
 least three months rather bad news spite
