 Mr. Prell.
 
 [Statement--see
 
 must questions!
 
 MR. BOEHNE. couple questions. page 4
 Greenbook, laid monetary policy assumptions
 bringing inflation next couple years.
 environment much support--certainly
 national support--for kind firming monetary policy, best
 tell. even besides that, going way end
 1991 6-1/4 percent unemployment rate slack
 continues 1992. don't indicate unemployment rate
 1992. presume goes another half point three-quarters
 point?
 MR. PRELL.
 6-1/4 percent.
 
 No, we're thinking it's within small fraction
 
 MR. BOEHNE. even done
 [firming], done much keep inflation
 accelerating, least terms numbers have.
 deceleration, inflation still largely 4 5
 percent area talking about. Now, presumably,
 carry [forecast] '93, '94, '95, begin get
 results. calls question whole logic behind
 approach gradually squeeze inflation out,
 desirable goal is. Somehow paragraph brought home (1)
 difficulty it, (2) unreasonable may even think
 pursue something like kind world
 live in. don't know that's question comment, guess
 I'd like disagree me.
 
 5/15/90
 
 second question credit crunch
 phenomenon. We've looked it; we've put together
 anecdotal reports, every report suggests there's less
 credit crunch talked popularly general press.
 I'm wondering insights

 doesn't seem problem
 zero extent it.
 often reported.
 MR. PRELL. Well, latter question, I'll offer little
 I'll repeat one conversation
 anecdotal information anecdotes.
 Bill Dunkelberg, conducts survey National
 Federation Independent Business. survey shown mild,
 any, changes credit picture constituency.
 related contacted Wall Street Journal
 published lead story credit crunch
 told that.
 look story, wasn't quoted.
 reporter obviously thought would better discuss negative
 news Dunkelberg's survey suggested.
 isn't say
 Dunkelberg survey absolutely reliable. think one finds
 sort bad news orientation press reports. One also needs
 look carefully geographic detail sectoral detail
 addressed. Everything seen suggests real
 estate area, particularly construction side market
 opposed permanent financing residential real estate,

 substantial change tenor credit conditions.
 don't see conflict anecdotal information area.
 small businesses, senior loan officers opinion survey

 it's affecting small medium size businesses, particularly

 consistent that.
 fact, I'd say could regarded

 getting lot disinflation perceive gap

 presume history telling

 sense, get sharp absolute declines activity

 time. don't think historical episodes go back
 say "Yes, periods economy moved slowly,

 evidence exists suggests ought able get

 like people perceive it's headed direction
 Fed persisting--accepting whatever slack is, presumably

 Frankly, people thought looking pretty good coming
 were. Maybe get see developing
 tradeoff look better.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. recent numbers change outlook any?
 gather put lot together recent
 numbers.
 MR. PRELL. employment numbers led us show weaker
 second quarter might otherwise. didn't feel
 comfortable pushing numbers much this.
 must say
 certainly arguments--looking what's going
 automobile sector--for larger second-quarter number.
 something feel comfortable with.
 MR. JOHNSON. question budget.
 implied strong action budget would restrict economy.
 assuming goes drop real interest
 rates? wonder: Wouldn't source stimulus
 degree too? coming restraint view?
 MR. PRELL. Well, complicated question, obviously.
 Part issue would whether one-shot effort
 hit Gramm-Rudman target coming fiscal year whether
 something would dramatically change outlook next
 series years greatly change expectations. open
 latter door you're somewhat sea terms econometric
 model. One come rather interesting results that,
 long-term rates going appreciably anticipation less
 pressure credit markets throughout coming years.
 opened door great deal investment activity happened
 quickly, could even extreme get net increase
 aggregate demand short run; short rates might even
 rise response keep things desirable path.
 Falling short that, Federal Reserve accommodative
 terms trying hold real GNP close path would otherwise

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mike, pursued gradual reduction
 rate inflation, it's quite likely, isn't it, noise may
 times obscure trend progress? That's apt happen
 gradual reduction approach significant recession.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Well, addition that--
 
 MR. ANGELL. So, even though ways may give
 Committee sense lot achievement, think would
 different pursue course?
 
 5/15/90
 
 MR. PRELL.
 Correct. suspicion hold
 current money market conditions, economic activity gradually
 pick up.
 see unemployment rate rise much, all,
 coming year so.
 since believe right
 pressures tendencies inflation point up,
 would make new course head direction. So, instead
 heading south 4 percent couple years now, feel
 risk inflation would heading north 5 percent.
 That's
 significant difference I'd hate make precise that.
 we've said, felt noise affecting reading
 trends [unintelligible] variety special factors:
 surprising strength dollar earlier year on.
 It's
 always difficult read [unintelligible].
 So, that's basic
 thrust assessment point.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Well, appreciate much laying
 
 policy options us have.
 MR. PARRY. point somewhat similar Governor
 Angell's. sentence page I-3 [of Greenbook] says: "The
 recent data reinforced view long embodied staff forecast
 
 restoration disinflationary trend unlikely current
 implication stay
 levels resource utilization."
 long time, small chance
 restoring disinflationary trend and, fact, might even
 produce increase inflationary pressures. That's
 implication.
 MR. PRELL. That's saying. Now, there's second
 part is: Federal Reserve obviously let
 financial conditions go, maintaining historic growth path
 resource utilization numbers are? that's second
 projection. One implication resource utilization level;
 second financial conditions compatible
 resource utilization levels. guess I'd say I'm little less sure
 second first there's good deal
 uncertainty first.
 MR. PARRY. One get's general feeling, though,
 public feels stay would
 continuation growth rates around 2 percent gradual
 [reduction inflation]. you're basically saying
 stay are, growth rates likely pick
 able restore [unintelligible].
 MR. PRELL. sense consensus business economists
 economy probably going run 2, 2-1/2 percent
 growth going next year 18 months inflation going
 remain roughly 4-1/2, 4-3/4, 5 percent zone.
 MR. PARRY. would assuming much way
 interest rate pressures?
 MR. PRELL. No. sense probably expecting
 little [change in] inflation, maybe slowdown-MR. PARRY.
 
 That's point.
 
 5/15/90
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoskins.
 
 MR. HOSKINS.
 two questions, Mike.
 One
 earlier period--1988 early 1989--when raised funds rate
 300 basis points, think. I'd like contrast view
 tradeoff now. raised interest rates lot lot happened.
 built forecast increase 125 basis points
 expecting get bang end 1991.
 I'd like compare two periods can.
 MR. PRELL. Let go back factual matter.
 built rise funds rate 200 basis
 points coming [some] latter half
 next year pressures begin abate.
 MR. HOSKINS.
 Okay, narrows tradeoff little.
 point I'm making acted fairly aggressively one
 point time get much, viewed people, terms
 [lower inflation] rates. necessarily get disastrous
 results either terms slowing growth, also didn't gain
 lot. kept inflation rate roughly was.
 guess
 could gotten lot worse done something.
 don't know
 see difference two periods would
 enlighten us now--perhaps not.
 second question
 deficit issue.
 argue could get benefit
 lower deficit future, you've revised 1990 deficit
 up, couldn't argue might need tighten take
 account instead future?
 MR. PRELL. Well, large part revision RTCrelated don't think that's real-MR. HOSKINS.
 
 It's real debt!
 
 MR. PRELL. measure shows shade less restraint
 current fiscal year previously that's mainly
 reflection reading information occurs tax
 side.
 look like tax revenues running bit weaker
 anticipated. seems come tax reform, reading
 lot 1989 experience, revenue falls bit relative
 previously anticipated forecast. So,
 little less restraint it's marginal difference, although that's
 [unintelligible] factor. Looking back 1988-1989 experience,
 many things different; one make
 difficult judgments timing various effects.
 point coming dollar depreciation causing
 considerable improvement export growth. Exports growing
 much strongly now. probably worked
 restraint. didn't have, perhaps, quite debacle think
 construction side, though office building
 going significantly wasn't point.
 Perhaps closer demographic requirements housing
 construction [unintelligible] cushion interest rate
 effects.
 levels somewhat different.
 think
 parallels two periods, differences;
 hard time drawing particular lesson. sense is,
 said, contain rate inflation. Whether slowing
 economy leveling unemployment rate occurred
 
 5/15/90
 
 attributable rise interest rates interest rates
 factors difficult say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. hate sound like Ginny Dimwit today,
 would walk one time sectors next
 two four quarters would taking off, would much stronger,
 status quo monetary policy? words, exactly
 sectors ones restrain? I'm problem
 finding sectors there.
 MR. PRELL. wasn't trying characterize current money
 market conditions alternative one led take off,
 merely gravitation back recent trend potential output--a
 sort natural tendency economy event unless
 countervailing forces. short run think could
 little better due pickup inventory accumulation relative
 significant swing seen negative direction
 inventories. without that, final demands economy
 show ultimately output growth. didn't get
 rise interest rates, would forecast stronger
 housing sector have. didn't restraint,
 would expect investment stronger. So, start removing
 restraint, interest sensitive sectors would look bit stronger
 across board we'd probably add top leaning
 toward moderate, higher have, level inventory
 accumulation. dollar weaker
 there--
 
 MS. SEGER. would soon see us export more,
 that's personal bias.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Then, I'd begin looking fiscal policy--
 
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 That's [unintelligible]
 
 shift.
 
 MS. SEGER. amount attention paying, then,
 availability credit housing situation?
 hear
 often it's price money price credit much
 strictly unavailability.
 MR. PRELL. Well, suggested, commercial real estate
 market may affected this. built

 it's large; it's hundreds thousands starts forecast,
 mild effect. think would abate time
 builders make connections new lenders lenders find ways

 think probably see abatement problems.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 hope you're right.
 
 questions Mr. Prell?
 
 5/15/90
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, technical question: inventory
 situation seems depending one looks it.
 going
 sort structural change time?
 much weight
 would put structural change toward just-in-time inventories
 sort thing?
 thinking it's still pretty accurate
 reflector [unintelligible]? view inventories
 we're likely see bounceback. think there's
 argument [businesses moving to] permanently
 lower levels inventories?
 MR. PRELL. judgment time don't see
 inventories impediment growth production.
 I'm
 inclined read really strong bullish factor, part
 reason suggested.
 think there's still effort,
 particularly manufacturing sectors too, decrease
 inventories relation order/shipment ratios. view
 still way go.
 industry economist meeting
 attended recently said: "Boy, numbers look great; boss
 thinks inventories still high."
 So, think target,
 effect, continuing drift downward. one
 reasons past year saw manufacturing inventory/sales
 ratios essentially level didn't move [our forecast]
 much. thought concern would likely lead
 effort restrain inventories. think [it turns out] that's
 pattern we've seen.
 think we're much better shape now;
 still, enthusiasm thinking we're verge boom
 [unintelligible].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Actually, leaner think
 numbers show conventional measure inventories

 [unintelligible]
 proportion inventories imported goods. one can't say
 excess inventories imported goods effect
 domestic production effect production foreign

 So, already pretty far down. But, Mike
 says, speak purchasing managers still way

 sales large tractors combines running significantly ahead

 inflation side, outlook certainly less clear;
 it's difficult tell first-quarter aberrations going
 work go along here. still, think, bit
 optimistic Mike see improving trends inflation
 get toward end year. Market pricing
 manufactured products continues very, competitive. There's
 lot pressure [to hold down] price increases, given capacity
 additions well foreign competition, [but] think we're going
 continue see price pressures. services sector, though,
 increases disturbing; would
 particularly true regard health care. wage side,
 basically increases seem continuing okay. One unusual
 example: talked somebody negotiated six-year contract
 machinists union day, provides annual cost
 increase 2 percent unusual features. think that's
 indication wage pressures continue pretty tight.
 national basis, think outlook growth
 continues positive. certainly we're going need see
 improvement inflation rate. continue optimistic,
 say, pretty soon we're going see evidenced

 Looking gross
 national product, best guess growth running
 around 2 percent two preceding quarters 1.1

 talk around table 2 percent growth rate
 could make slow progress, nevertheless progress, inflation.
 look inflation measured CPI, appalling

 we're beginning see flattening profit margins

 anything, would say evidence [that economic
 growth is] probably mildly accelerating.
 trouble, however, side
 something merely minor financial disturbance. think
 
 may well credit crunch we're looking at;

 put exactly, don't think we're yet.
 concurrent data pick place suggest
 been, stated, mild pulling back.
 evidence stopped. example, evidence
 
 forward commitments, specifically real estate projects loans,

 don't know stage extent spilled

 Jerry pointed out--mildly disturbing say

 something constraining financial capacity even though
 underlying orders patterns suggest there's something

 [in data] gets worse. we're this,
 stabilize turn around--or worst stabilize, even
 stabilizes pretty low levels--because
 fairly significant contractionary effect distance

 substantial part goods markets.
 So, leads type dilemma
 found last meeting, clearly
 dangers sides. look ahead, probability
 next move side think one
 presume credit crunch limited. trouble, however,
 point still growing; move tighten
 stage evidence credit crunch still occurring
 think would mistake. Also, despite fact think
 probably required move move down, wouldn't
 inclined stage asymmetric side. might
 seem odd way put it, although odds suggest that's
 direction going in, I'm sure
 position manner credit crunch matter
 stabilized. Nonetheless, think inflation problem
 troublesome. would feel comfortable "B" either
 symmetric asymmetric, must say would prefer symmetric would
 policy record relate concerns expressed
 around table issues inflation instabilities
 create. But, like last time, think it's tough call;
 suspect may less easy get
 year. So, bottom line moment "B" symmetric,
 extensive language policy record issue inflation.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, could support position
 somewhat different reasons. seems uncertainties

 So, would

 don't think condition economy clear. Also, I'm
 concerned fragility financial system. I'm

 we're talking credibility sending signals,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. preference "B" asymmetric.
 certainly wouldn't make big deal that, given preference
 statements policy record showing concerns. It's
 splitting hairs make point. However, like Dick Syron, I'm
 little worried intermeeting period get
 stronger numbers, credibility could slip rapidly.
 concerned weeks meeting right
 edge totally losing credibility got CPI
 purchasing managers' survey results; data coming
 strong. course, recent numbers extent bailed
 us out. Maybe that's indication illusion

 intermeeting move. think we're situation if, say,
 credit crunch concerns start dissipate sudden get
 one two strong numbers, may make next meeting
 credibility intact. ought flexible enough able
 react that.

 MR. ANGELL.
 I'm somewhat tempted, Mr. Chairman,
 counterbalance governor vote tightness offset Mr.
 Hoskins' dissent don't continue issue presidents
 versus governors tightening side. guess really
 wouldn't logical basis cast vote.
 would note
 presidents voting two five could
 muster tightness [policy stance].
 ones
 voting, four five muster tightness, think
 probably gives presidents reputation hawks.
 presidents really hawks don't vote!
 MR. SYRON. want tighten won't
 tighten later vote!
 MR. ANGELL.
 seems me, Mr. Chairman,
 correct uncertainty right now.
 uncertainty that, even though I'm mood tighten
 hoping would tightening, believe would much
 better us wait couple weeks see happens
 time. could act point time rather run risk
 tightening conditions go direction
 credibility lost side would able
 need it.
 So, sense, I'm
 sympathetic position, Mr. Chairman.
 certainly
 understand prudence direction. would prefer
 directive would read tighten now, vote affirmative
 understanding we're close together
 consensus says: deem attack inflation
 high priority; think following priority
 gives economic expansion opportunity develop
 strengthen lengthen it; steeled
 ready done time future;
 deterred there's little bit pain
 [involved].
 hoping could get painless way
 but, frankly, learned 4-1/4 years tells it's tougher

 likes ease.
