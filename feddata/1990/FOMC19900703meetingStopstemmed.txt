 someth like actual budget deficit exclud-mr. prell.
 give you, exampl, cbo's rule
 thumb. on percent chang real growth start begin

 first year.
 vice chairman corrigan.
 mr. prell.
 second year.
 
 much?
 
 it's $7 billion first year $26 billion
 real output primari focu?
 
 vice chairman corrigan. try ask thi:
 look earlier chart page 3 differ 1991
 staff number administr number gnp,
 unemploy, etc., make rough ballpark guess,
 translat term budget deficit?
 mr. prell. 1991, would take fairli sizabl
 differ on build differ interest rate
 assumpt. exampl, treasuri bill rate 1991--these
 
 7/2-3/90
 
 publish number yet--is averag 6.8 percent.
 that's
 littl lower forecast entail.
 look across board
 that's probabl worth somewher $5 $10 billion; don't
 know particular phase. add output path
 differ, would think we're run differ someth
 $10 $20 billion area term econom assumpt.
 inflat differ small; project aren't

 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. somewhat relat jerri's question: like
 it, congress goe expenditur cut budget higher
 tax, actual would produc larger deficit
 impact fiscal restraint would slow growth even further?
 mr. prell. well, simul suggest it's within
 power monetari polici offset [expect] drag.
 might
 take aggress action, believ model, it's doabl.
 guess that's most-ms.
 
 seger.
 
 think time would work
 
 that?
 mr. prell. mechan, model sai thi.

 guess sai, follow earlier question 1991
 budget deficit, wasn't realli build differ
 1990 forecast, would start thing littl wors
 widen gap.
