 Europeans. September 5th Chancellor Schroeder prepared

 Second, even so, think operation recognized

 expected earlier year. given deceleration output growth, productivity gains probably
 moderate some. given continued pace capital deepening reports get

 transition demand pressure results upward trend core inflation unless supply shocks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank much. Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, last two meetings, Committee kept
 stance policy unchanged, expressed concern risks going forward

 72
 
 Indeed, Committee might see developments last

 macroeconomic objectives balance foreseeable future.
 financial markets adopted view risks balanced time ago.
 Indeed, recently, market participants would appear placing greater
 odds Committee need lower interest rates cushion softening

 important reason Committee’s perception inflation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Tom? Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Tom, Exhibit 2--and let stick fiscal policy B sake

 MR. SIMPSON. Right.
 MR. GRAMLICH. bottom two panels put together

 89
 
 MR. SIMPSON. Yes. Actually, middle panel mirror image upper

 MR. GRAMLICH. Okay. Anyway, two things going on: declining
 Treasury debt, taking share, rising currency demand.
 alternative assets get huge years. take you're telling us
 don't yet know alternative assets are. parts study?
 question. kept looking [laughter] assume that's next installment.
 MR. SIMPSON. Right. project broken several pieces. thought
 first step get idea Treasury market going look like kinds
 constraints going face choose continue rely market coming years.
 tough stuff yet come!
 MR. GRAMLICH. fun stuff still come!
 MR. FISHER. tells big animal behind door No. 2 is. doesn't tell
 animal is!
 MR. GRAMLICH. know! think know it's big animal. wondered
 whether stripes spots.
 MR. SIMPSON. We're saying yet!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think information helpful certainly
 provides good grounding come. sure going extremely
 interesting also challenging. First, wondering know anything lead times
 would terms able look material prior discussing it. Secondly,

 wondered whether time would set aside discuss environment may
 slightly leisurely than, say, FOMC meeting lunch.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, replicate Bill McDonough

 SPEAKER(?). We’re okay, thanks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. don't think people working alternative assets part
 study quite taken account baseball teams!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. going start run alternatives.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, think right. takes real point wanted
 raise, cash driving this. cash impact balance sheet,
 impact fiscal infrastructure well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. mean currency?
 MS. MINEHAN. Currency needs, forth. anything--and maybe
 answer question--to look whether ways future diminish supply

 MR. PARRY. growth overseas.
 MR. SIMPSON. That's right.
 MS. MINEHAN. That’s right. know it's mostly overseas.
 MR. KOHN. don't anything part project look ways diminish
 growth currency. wonder policy issue, want diminish growth
 noninterest-earning debt there?
 MS. MINEHAN. It's least worth looking at.
 MR. JORDAN. Why?
 MR. KOHN. always responded passively demands currency.
 MR. MCTEER. seigniorage good!
 MR. PARRY. beats taxes.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. It's low interest rate.
 MR. FERGUSON. spend $2 billion year less get back $28 billion

 MS. MINEHAN. Well, that's right.
 MR. FERGUSON. I'd rather profit sharing! [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. Okay.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think tells us whole issue much
 closer front think us intuitively suspected. difficult get around
 fact off-budget items stay budget actually acts unified budget surplus,
 arithmetic awesome.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, is, way time consider
 right decision, particularly willing change 25 percent. agree sense
