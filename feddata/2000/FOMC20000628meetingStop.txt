 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.

 MR. JORDAN. don't know going helpful not! [Laughter] Instead
 talking unemployment rate, highly visible, highly politicized figure,

 5-1/2 million people. lot churning inventory, lot ins outs.
 get sorts information look number 5-1/2 million--and total

 information communication--has moved inventory many items needed
 building cars. implying inventory people getting paycheck
 needs around 7-1/4 million, otherwise prices goods rise, rise faster rate.
 Without repeating already said, draw connection tells inventory
 unemployed individuals needs 7-1/4 million instead 5-1/2 million people.
 MR. STOCKTON. recast question, involves gross correlation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Dave, Greenbook mentions core consumer inflation

 according Greenbook forecast, core consumer inflation would reduced. Could
 give idea size precise effects core consumer inflation rate?
 MR. STOCKTON. Roughly speaking, depending particular model

 indirect effects accelerating energy prices. Then, 2001 prices retrace,
 get back, part reason forecast see pronounced
 acceleration core inflation year much acceleration next year, despite
 fact unemployment rate moves up.
 MR. PARRY. try understand happening core inflation, think it’s
 important make adjustments because, effects energy prices factored in,
 looks really significant acceleration begins 2001.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. best way summarize sentiment executives
 older manufacturing industries region “hostile.” Following surprisingly strong

 probably inevitable inflection that, came, would catch least
 manufacturers surprise. embarrassed, one might say, extrapolated

 anecdotal stories I’m hearing part country suggest second half

 Let make couple comments oil prices. Even though oil overall

 it’s still significant factor. oil prices importing country go up, go
 sharply, wealth lost us terms trade changed wealth redistributional
 effects internationally. probably importantly, redistributional effects within

 inflation trends, suppose I’m worried commentators
 I’ve heard today seem inflation definitely rising trend. may
 couple years ago never believed core inflation rate low indicated

 opportunistic way, domestic international situation simply didn’t allow that.
 Nevertheless, movement may simply return kind trend actually

 accelerating is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like many others
 commented morning, looking regional information we’ve received since last

 56
 
 order get closer look residential construction activity, contacted last
 week fairly sizable number real estate people builders see could tell us.
 appear residential sales building activity may peaked sometime earlier
 year District. Several builders told us, people talk to, Jack,
 projected big drop firms’ activity remainder year. others told
 us date experienced substantial softening demand. couple said
 still work could handle. though don’t good hard data this,
 anecdotal information get sales existing homes consistent national number
 released yesterday. Sales still seem fairly strong prices rising.
 nonresidential sector, one directors

 project bids received much, much higher anticipated, mainly
 general contractors talking can’t find adequate subcontractors.
 So, that’s housing construction part it. Again, reports mixed give
 us clear picture all.
 Probably strongest evidence diminished activity District
 sales cars, furniture, consumer durables. number car dealers talk
 directors reports weaker car sales--and one two cases,
 significantly weaker sales. But, others mentioned, it’s hard point get
 clear sense whether likely persistent decline something temporary,
 following extraordinarily robust sales increases first quarter. Labor markets
 still tight District. Reported unemployment rates state level drifted
 slightly District states, may mean situation getting
 tighter. overall don’t sense real sea change labor markets area.
 
 57
 
 final comment region we’ve lot reports business people generally
 much less optimistic near-term prospects earlier year, due
 things one would expect--rising interest rates, real estate prices, forth.
 sense sentiment could turn back pretty quickly got break fuel prices.
 think rise prices playing large role attitudes currently.
 views similar national outlook. signs demand may
 finally moderating somewhat, point think regard signs
 essentially preliminary. It’s clear me--and others said this--whether
 moderation going persist see decline underlying trend growth
 domestic demand whether it’s temporary deceleration. regard, think it’s
 important remember 10 percent annual rate increase domestic final private
 purchases first quarter; series like that, offset next quarter would
 expected. So, think Greenbook projection real GDP growth close potential
 remainder year makes lot sense. recent data may indicate
 risks projections real growth may little better balanced two three
 months ago, believe still probably skewed side. contrast Jerry Jordan,
 though, see price data somewhat longer-term context emerging trend
 higher core inflation deteriorating prospects inflation find worrisome. certainly
 would acknowledge we’re confronted kind breakout inflation yet.
 see it, core PCE core CPI appear moved higher underlying
 pace recent months. baseline scenarios discussing bit earlier show
 fair number different scenarios--and couple cases even significant
 tightening monetary policy--we get continued increase core inflation.

 risks inflation front higher we’ve seen time. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. far Ninth District economy
 concerned, objective measures economic activity remain positive. Let give
 one fairly familiar example this. past year employment gains continued
 substantial; unemployment rates virtually District states levels
 lower year ago--and quite low year ago. Furthermore,
 occurred sizable gains labor force. objective measures, whether look
 manufacturing, construction, consumer spending, remain quite positive. anecdotal
 evidence bit mixed, think, doubts concerns coming principally
 business community. would characterize consumers way, number
 business people I’ve talked recently expressed concern financial market
 developments. obviously know interest rates higher. know course

 think injected note caution parts business community least

 far national economy concerned, seems outlook real

 61
 
 Let go back discussion NAIRU make comments.
 Obviously, macroeconomic model, everything simultaneously determined. want
 start saying understand that. think two different conceptions
 NAIRU less causation running opposite directions. traditional
 NAIRU formulation views wage/price process running gap--a gap measured
 somehow GDP gap labor market gap. direction causation goes pretty
 much something happens change gap feeds alter course
 wage price changes. think alternative model views process
 angle 180 degrees around. says earlier conception, either
 determination monetary aggregate federal funds rate policy, monetary policy
 pins price level rate inflation and, therefore, expectations rate
 inflation. labor market settles, must, equilibrium rate unemployment.
 labor market settles Milton Friedman called natural rate
 unemployment. causation goes fundamentally monetary policy price
 determination back labor market rather labor market forward
 price determination. certainly view causation second sense. think
 willingness Federal Reserve stamp signs rising inflation ultimately pins
 expectations price level inflation rate. Now, labor market
 clearing level us found surprising. don’t think necessarily
 particular implication rate inflation, provided make sure willing act
 necessary. long inflation expectations remain well control willing
 move, think pins rate inflation adequate way. understand
 everything determined simultaneously, think two rather different directions
 
 62
 
 causation people mind. macroeconomic model used here, count
 way arbitrarily pin expected rate inflation, solve model
 quite satisfactorily. Again, that’s assumption one puts model, think flows
 monetary policy pursued. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let begin noting economic
 activity Tenth District still solid. said that, also true seeing
 mounting evidence slowing trends within region. starts manufacturing,
 certainly slowed, firms clearly reporting smaller usage capacity. latest surveys
 purchasing managers region--in front range Colorado--suggest
 manufacturing activity slowing fairly substantially, least national average.
 Also, conversations we’ve had, business executives indicated
 projects deferred. also seeing evidence retail sales softened.
 addition, housing activity, weakened April May, reported weakened
 June well. Nonresidential construction activity remains relatively strong, many
 executives industry telling cautionary attitude emerged
 expecting slowing recent interest rate moves begin greater effect
 them. energy sector benefiting current level prices, especially gas drilling
 area, fairly active. industry, course, downsizing
 earlier periods, harder get skilled labor drilling operations and, therefore, activity
 coming rather slowly. One
 
 involved gas drilling
 
 fairly significant way says inventories low now. Consequently, demand
 
 63
 
 strong go year, feels surge prices natural gas
 move winter.
 District labor markets still tight. don’t hear quite sense urgency
 situation labor conditions clearly tight. price pressures
 similar we’ve reported past: efforts raise prices still lot
 competitive pressure holding down. farm industry, especially commodity side,
 remains weak. recent additions government payments, farm incomes steady
 overall.
 Turning national scene, recent indicators, conjunction various
 developments District I’ve mentioned here, leave clear impression
 economy slow recent inflationary pressures ease time.
 Specifically, revised outlook growth year next
 projecting 3-3/4 percent GDP growth forecast horizon. slightly
 estimates trend growth. However, unlike Greenbook, get projections
 fed funds rate remains current level. number reasons
 likely slowing, view. One moderation stock market gains; another increase
 real interest rates. Certainly, elevated oil gas energy prices factor.
 importantly perspective recent increases funds rate restrictive
 monetary policy. evidence seeing still mixed, think hard
 statistical evidence slowdown. Also, hearing views business people,
 examples cited earlier, higher interest rates led slowdown economic
 activity change business sentiment think important.
 
 64
 
 Regarding inflation outlook, aware effects previously
 accommodative monetary policy passthrough oil prices non-energy sectors
 continuing put upward pressure core inflation near term. also
 convinced necessarily see acceleration core inflation
 moved restrictive policy past year tightening full
 impact economy yet. long remain restrictive period time,
 increase inflation temporary, think, rather permanent. I’m looking
 inflation year 2 percent, measured core PCE, rise somewhat,
 course, go next year. don’t see acceleration inflation. think

 71
 
 MR. MEYER. know, love talking macro modeling love talking
 NAIRU, like talking outlook too. first things first. Let start
 responding President Poole's comments whether might two different models
 causal process determines inflation. think one model; may
 convince that, let try explain reasoning. Phillips curve model
 determines inflation. vertical Phillips curve tells us inflation indeterminate
 model. Phillips curve tells us inflation constant, rising,
 falling. It's model dynamics inflation process, it's incomplete
 full model.
 causality money prices? Well, that's important. That's
 equilibrium relationship, helps pin along vertical Phillips curve
 inflation really be. gets one inflation rate another money
 growth changes? dynamic model. Phillips curve does.
 need parts. problem even skepticism
 NAIRU, understand throw concept away, don't another model
 point, think President Stern suggested. That's problem. still
 question value NAIRU is, let's think minute would situation
 really believed NAIRU 4 percent. would asking myself:
 come inflation high? core CPI inflation rate 2.4 percent methodologically
 consistent basis would 1995. Now, period since 1995,
 unemployment rate NAIRU. kinds relative price shocks
 lowering inflation. got productivity shock lowering inflation. So, come
 
 72
 
 inflation high? One thing keep mind don't believe framework it’s
 clear would bother tighten wanted slow inflation.
 Let’s move outlook. think slowdown that's clear second quarter
 raises two important questions Committee. first whether pause
 sustainable slowdown. sustainable, question whether sufficient
 achieve objective containing risks higher inflation. Now, describe May
 employment report incredible--meaning literally believable. believable
 private payrolls effect fell cliff May, cliff elevated sharp
 increases previous two months. That's say isn't information content
 report, makes sense least smooth data get better sense underlying
 reality. Granted, don't know whether smooth backward forward. Usually
 smoothing directions norm. think plenty reason smooth
 going backward economy soared previous three quarters degree
 unanticipated forecasters models. part slowdown could simply
 smoothing growth average line fundamentals, process taking
 underlying rate while.
 Now, private sector forecaster, admit frequently confronted
 unexpected data, data contradicted forecast. case decide
 much respond altering forecast changing story. developed two rules
 believe served well. Now, certainly, one could change current-quarter forecast.
 question forecast next year two. Rule number one
 data disconfirm forecast, initially ignore new data defend old
 forecast. simply stubbornness. Well, it's stubbornness degree, [Laughter]
 
 73
 
 it's stubbornness. also involves recognition volatility high frequency
 data, difficulties associated seasonal adjustment, potential revisions
 reversals data. Rule number two know say when. is, data
 continue contradict forecast, time change forecast. Otherwise, clients tend
 change forecasters! course, really good forecasters know shift rule
 one rule two.
 forecaster, I'm still operating rule number one, think staff
 appears following strategy. noted, slowdown expected,
 whether beginning second third quarter, unexpected indeed
 inexplicable surge previous three quarters. Now, part slowdown could also
 cumulative effect monetary policy tightening. think Chart 2 staff's outlook
 packet suggests tighter financial conditions cannot explain much second-quarter
 slowdown.
 Presumably, good rules thumb policymaking respond
 unexpected economic developments. case, don't believe rule number one would
 ignore new data continue set policy based old forecast. new data
 least raise degree uncertainty forecast. high order uncertainty
 may reasonably justify cautious policy response old forecast. difference
 reflects fact forecast mode probability distribution associated

 expected rapid growth first quarter, whether reflects residual
 seasonality, whether something else going on. One things recent
 intermeeting period ask staff give least sense evidence residual
 seasonality. They've done that. they've shown me, least looking
 longer periods, doesn't seem systematic trend second quarter much
 slower quarters course year. think probably
 
 76
 
 rule systematic seasonality here. think still possible saw
 second quarter may bit result weather-related changes special
 factors can't pick econometrically. said that, I'd still put little weight,
 perhaps others well, fact see early signs slowing.
 place would look evidence slowing yield curve private sector
 where--again using normal mode interpretation--those private sector seem
 telling us behavior seeing slowing well.
 final thing one might look evidence slowing interaction
 high gas prices one might expect consumer behavior. Again, working
 FRB/US model, seems though increases we've seen oil prices amount
 somewhere $40 $50 billion less money available consumers spend going
 forward. effects might start show soon next quarter. think
 two three reasons feel perhaps beginning slowing actually
 sight here.
 said that, others indicated, also clearly signs
 slowing certain one might like. Obviously recent signals we've seen
 respect housing data suggest uncertainty this. Another factor might
 give rise uncertainty financial market conditions previous
 meeting become, anything, little accommodative. Net corporate borrowings,
 driven bond issuance, seem picked intermeeting period. Finally,
 others noted, doesn't seem much let-up resource utilization, particularly
 respect labor market. signs sides think need
 mindful deliberate.
 
 77
 
 two points make here. One seem, Governor Gramlich
 said, bit good news indicators long-term inflation
 expectations haven't moved much period. think gives us sign
 little time side. finally, staff presentation pointed
 Governor Meyer also noted, unlikely we've seen thus far reflects full impact
 tightening undertaken. is, believe, certain amount tightening
 impact still left pipeline.
 sum, sense slowing train. might well continue one
 believes market indicators. appear, Governor Meyer indicated,
 pickup inflation, doesn't seem though break imminent
 inflation expectations gone us. Nevertheless, since worked hard
 last year respect interest rates, may tightening.
 stage think could comfortably take bit pause, look incoming data bit
 closely, judge whether slowing one comfortable.
 careful signal we're done, fact don't know sure
 we're done. Nevertheless, think take bit cautious attitude toward possible
 tightening stage. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 especially true one agrees view first 75 basis points involved correction

 June 28, 2000--Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. arrived
 agenda topic relating long-term ranges monetary aggregates. know,
 topic stems Humphrey-Hawkins legislation--a term longer use except
 historical context. proposed putting long-run ranges monetary aggregates
 agenda placeholder. intention, right everyone, forgo
 discussion vote ranges. longer legally required that.
 Committee, know, using ranges aggregates guide policy
 many years. Indeed, recent years ranges become even questionable
 benchmarks money growth price stability uncertainties long-run
 productivity growth exactly mean price stability. ranges
 reporting accountability mechanism part Federal Reserve Act
 expired. seems likely outcome proposal renew legislation
 require provide semi-annual reports monetary policy Congress
 include requirement annual ranges.
 So, unless hear objections, propose take advantage opportunity
 stop something sense us become uncomfortable years-establishing money ranges questionable usefulness one takes seriously,
 least recently taken seriously. quite conceivable ranges may

 So, unless somebody comments objections, way believe ought

 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, could make quick comment? don't disagree

 83
 
 though used significant operational way recently, provided
 occasion us take longer-term, strategic view policy objectives least
 twice year meetings. provided least whiff quantitative

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Actually, agree that. think resolve
 issue without going formal process required statute. don't
 see reason can't something agenda, essentially involves
 discussion long-term inflation imbalances whatever want call it. Don, let ask
 question this. formally went two-day FOMC meetings meetings
 preceding Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. contemplated future still
 two-day meetings? still need two days? additional
 time meetings? reason, example, can't put agenda
 instead long-term monetary aggregates something covers area generic
 way could presentation staff Committee discussion?
 MR. KOHN. No, reason couldn't that. actually thought
 wouldn’t change format meetings significantly since Committee
 spending half-hour monetary aggregates. terms preparation

 MR. KOHN. Yes, there’s absolutely reason.
 MR. BROADDUS. would certainly help lot. think would

 MR. BROADDUS. certainly respect point view, Mr. Chairman. would

 86
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. fully agree. think way statute written

 could square. got statute designed things
 people long good. would first go Hill try get something
 done thought even remotely feasible. Right bill specifically
 exclusively restricted us inflation target would get Senate Banking
 Committee probably would even get House Banking Committee discussion.
 That’s view state play. going need evidence move
 forward that.
 MR. BROADDUS. build case.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, going make comment similar one
 Al Broaddus made. think discussion monetary targets highly imperfect
 way nevertheless getting important point ought agreement
 around table--namely, inflation target Committee mind.
 believe divergent views around table inflation target ought be.
 would rather see discussion focused inflation target itself. Whatever attitude
 Congress, need working assumption. present time different
 working assumptions around table would like go, say, medium
 term, direction would like work. people around table
 would like inflation rate lower likely be. would count
 camp. think others quite satisfied current rate
 would willing see go somewhat higher come hard, policy terms,
 
 87
 
 try something it. So, although highly imperfect, think discussion
 monetary aggregates implicitly background focus Committee's long-run
 objectives inflation, think would desirable clarify.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Actually, I’d characterize nuances
 involved slightly different way. took vote whether, things equal,
 around table would like see inflation rate lower today, bet would get
 unanimity. differences show cost tradeoffs. That’s
 differences arise. don't think issue lack commitment part us
 getting close stable prices possible. would presume pretty much
 agreement stable prices, things equal, get maximum long-term sustainable
 growth. issue, however, differing views Committee regarding
 actual mechanism involved tradeoffs respect various aspects
 economy, different rates inflation, employment, interest rates, like. agree
 doubtless differences around table cost/benefit tradeoff

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. enjoyed discussion, too. Let cut slightly
 different way. inflation targeting issue think three levels

 quite useful. often thought terms statements described

 think good idea us issues agenda discussion twice year

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. would like
 add hope statement release public quite strongly worded. think
 recommended action exactly market consensus expects would hate see
 overly euphoric reaction it, believe quite possible. may indeed need tighten
 more--perhaps quite soon perhaps considerable amount. hope put market
 clearly notice effect.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one two ways--either
 statement, presumably would merely reiteration previous remarks,
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, surely fine-tune it.
 
 111
 
 MR. KELLEY. However, would like see statement today little
 stronger words used past.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m sure would agree lots
 reasons, let's hold see rest Committee members say.
 MR. KELLEY. Fine. want put table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. don't see reason deviate pattern! [Laughter]
 support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation, too. note
 position felt comfortable went home weekend.
 Bluebook came opened it, found sort arguing questioning
 whether feel comfortable decision, given views. noted, example,
 position would appropriate wasn't sure inflation would intensify going
 forward. guess depends mean “sure.” word forecasters
 loathe use circumstances. think inflation likely rise.
 next thing Bluebook said position would appropriate less convinced
 staff output beyond potential. Well, least convinced staff
 output beyond potential. certainly struggling this.
 
 112
 
 Then, wasn’t enough, Bluebook went say want take
 view interest rates go hold following views: First,
 indications slower expansion still tentative. Okay, believe that. Second, resource
 utilization still quite high. Well, believe that, too. Third, earlier financial
 restraint unwound recent rally bond equity markets. factually
 true. fourth, favor tightening especially believe growth may
 slow trend unwind prevailing excess labor market. Well, believe
 things, struggle decision.
 don't put extraordinary weight goes one meeting. think getting
 direction overall response right really important. So, feel comfortable
 holding pat today moved decisively since last June also
 believe data likely show wisdom moving perhaps early
 next meeting. given done past, confident
 needs done time get done timely fashion insure favorable outcome.
 So, support recommendation confidence taken steps
 mitigate risks higher inflation, also belief work yet done.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. agree recommendation, Mr. Chairman, particularly
 part keeps Committee record press statement HumphreyHawkins testimony risks still side. agree Governor Kelley's point
 this, although would little concerned changing wording statement

 113
 
 think probably better stay stable set words allow fine-tune
 message Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
 happen believe recent data regard slowing economy
 perhaps little less definitive around table may believe. also level
 concern employment data. agree totally impossible discern
 two models accurately reflects going don't think
 know conclusively whether unemployment rate going down. Everything see
 markets based real-life experience would suggest labor markets tight
 unemployment rate, anything, going down, up.
 event, concerned coming meeting thought inflation
 likely rise future, would better acting sooner rather later
 appropriate early action tends ameliorate longer-run effects. don't see
 difference moving moving August meeting, August
 lot data. So, agree proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, could take bit time here, would like
 look closely Bluebook's baseline forecast. found helpful trying think
 longer-run implications today. think it's important that.
 baseline scenario, plausible scenario implications
 think important terribly comforting. baseline takes starting point
 economy currently operating potential assumes NAIRU 5 percent.
 Obviously, questionable. questioned yesterday, perfectly reasonable.
 certainly good chance NAIRU thinking
 
 114
 
 analytically making decisions is, fact, 5 percent. believe need
 consider carefully economic outcome assumption might be. also
 need consider cost outcome, even likelihood lower may
 before. accept provisionally follow baseline, idea
 able operate NAIRU rising productivity growth
 made possible firms increase wages without pushing unit labor costs.
 Now, productivity growth could, course, keep rising would tend bail us
 out, could put way. mature economy like this, think would clearly
 unwise make assumption. baseline scenario make assumption.
 assumes trend productivity growth continues current rate rest decade,
 would mean point fairly soon increase wages presumably unit labor
 costs would emerge. baseline case then, implies unemployment rate
 move toward assumed 5-1/4 percent NAIRU keep core PCE rising
 3 percent. happen, turn real funds rate go percentage point.
 summarize: baseline, think plausible scenario, us
 raising nominal funds rate almost 2 percentage points time unemployment rate
 rising sharply. even doesn't really hold line inflation inflation moves
 close 3 percent obviously could go higher. baseline scenario, carefully
 worked analysis, certainly plausible possible outcome, comforting.
 difficult pull off, think, requires us raise funds rate
 significantly time unemployment rising. bad news view
 dealing situation assumed scenario, really run risk finding
 behind curve respect actual inflation respect inflation
 
 115
 
 expectations. could point force us take strong action, could put end
 expansion. lot stake.
 Quickly, options? One could wait maybe meeting
 even longer hope get rescued, certainly possible. Productivity growth
 could continue rise. Also, higher credibility NAIRU may well
 5 percent. things possible also plausible. view
 accept hypothesis follow option, perhaps ought supplement
 word prayer time time! [Laughter]
 option, see it, preemptive raise funds rate
 aggressively unemployment begins rise. Markets appear expect funds rate
 approaching 7 percent end year. Early next year could move closer to, say,
 7-1/2 percent, degree begin process now. way might shore
 credibility, keep inflation expectations rising, limit amount would
 actually increase nominal funds rate course whole cycle. Obviously,
 without risk. approach could cause economy weaker really
 assumptions scenario accurate. labor markets tight
 are, seems risk worth taking. That’s because--and really key
 point me--if fall behind curve inflation breaks out, likely
 point situation create recession order restore price
 stability credibility. means go back stop/go monetary policy
 years past, think worst possible outcome.
 So, guess that’s long way saying think solid case could made
 move today. certainly accept proposal understand reasons it.
 
 116
 
 would say primary support proposal evidence
 slowdown. lot data suggesting slowdown, think evidence still
 quite preliminary careful much weight give it. certainly think
 need asymmetric directive. would make point too: There’s long period time
 next scheduled meeting, month July getting lot
 additional information behavior economy June, either confirm
 earlier data not. question arises, think would particularly appropriate
 intermeeting period call, maybe end July early August take another look
 situation. would hate wait late August, couple months election,
 find real bind. make suggestion. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, support proposal. don't know
 moved far need to, suspect right still lot monetary policy
 effects pipeline actions taken recently yet fully play.
 ought let work observe taking us. others said, lot
 data coming next several weeks think provide us useful
 information make judgment effects earlier tightening
 moves. One side benefits press statement last time indicated balance
 risks side today acting it, believe healthy thing
 well. So, think recommendation good one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let note briefly--I
 added yesterday, perhaps--that discussion different models various ways
 
 117
 
 looking economy working time, would joined yesterday
 expressed uneasiness NAIRU construct. Like colleagues Minneapolis,
 believe Reserve Banks, using VAR model try gauge
 different inflation paths given different fed funds assumptions. modeling work suggests
 restraint already put place going deliver inflation path close
 100 basis points lower would without tightening. also ran
 experiment last week getting Greenbook used amount substantial
 additional tightening assumed Greenbook. VAR model suggested
 aggressive degree tightening would involve considerable risks real economy.
 risks side well, seems me.
 would join underscored importance maintaining bias
 balance risks statement time. heard say, seeing
 direct effects higher rates maybe even importantly sense caution
 prudence among people talk to, result tightening put place.
 think absolutely essential keep place lose point.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First Vice President Stone.
 MR. STONE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. Particularly light
 action taken last meeting also forecast long-run expected
 inflation remained stable, think time take look whether economy
 truly slowing point. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.

 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. meeting support
 recommendation action. line Vice Chairman's remarks yesterday,
 recommendation raise federal funds rate--whether meeting subsequent
 meeting--had underlying objective raising unemployment rate opening gap
 potential output actual output, would oppose that. think easy
 kinds exercises scenarios derived models become objectives,
 Committee least minds observers. cannot imagine Chart 3 Bluebook
 appearing monetary policy report Congress. simply cannot picture reaction
 chart included document. Like Governor Meyer, reading Bluebook
 tried find telling regarding position take. regard
 inflation objectives, Bluebook tells meeting support 50 basis point
 increase funds rate announcement--in line President Poole’s remarks
 previous meetings nice surprise markets--that increase funds rate
 another 50 basis points subsequent four meetings year plan
 raise funds rate 9 percent December. Now, reaction would chaos
 financial markets. would produce results indicated that, course.
 model would tell us results would get can’t forecast would happen
 announce market 250 basis points additional tightening
 December. So, don't know use exercise guiding position ought
 taking support price stability objective.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. agree recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would Secretary read appropriate language?
 
 119
 
 MR. BERNARD. language comes page 19 Bluebook: “The Federal
 Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability
 promote sustainable growth output. long-run objectives, Committee
 immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent maintaining federal
 funds rate average around 6-1/2 percent.” sentence going press release
 would read: “Against background long run-goals price stability sustainable

 risks weighted mainly toward conditions may generate heightened inflation pressures
