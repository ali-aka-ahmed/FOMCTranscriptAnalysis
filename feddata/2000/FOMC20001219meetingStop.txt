 view, would appear three principal questions
 surrounding changes made Greenbook forecast.
 First, staff overreacted accumulating signs slowing
 economy, many anecdotal, marking substantially near-term
 forecast? regard, revised outlook significantly
 1995 1998 signs slowing emerged, discover
 months later expansion lost little momentum. Second-and conversely--is staff ignoring powerful signals

 contraction activity may already way? all, noted
 July chart show, staff--and matter virtually economic
 forecasters--fail reliably predict recessions. finally, possible
 staff’s projection slowing growth attendant easing
 resource pressures--without recession--could correct?
 Let begin answering final question,
 simplest answer provides implicit response
 first two questions. think safely say, probability
 approaching one, staff forecast correct. Exactly
 wrong, course, clear. think reasonable
 case made currently experiencing sharp
 slowing aggregate production, rather either temporary dip

 little doubt signs significant
 widespread slowing real output continued multiply since

 vehicles declined recent months, expecting
 noticeable drop-off pace sales first quarter. Faced

 burgeoning inventories. Rather prop sales
 sweetening incentives, manufacturers cutting production
 schedules. Moreover, expecting already-reduced plans

 likely cleared spring.
 Neither sales production light vehicles yet exhibited
 fall cyclical dimensions. cannot said heavy trucks-a sector term “recession” applied fairly. first

 backlogs severely depressed, expecting perceptible
 recovery time soon.

 beyond motor vehicle manufacturers. sure,

 MR. PARRY. Dave, forecast, estimate potential growth next two

 MR. STOCKTON. think that's interesting question. It's one we’ve
 kicking around, I'm sure complete answer it. It's obvious sense
 
 23
 
 higher underlying potential output growth, 2 percent shortfall would still give us growth
 around 2 2-1/4 percent whereas potential output 2-1/4 percent growth could near 0.
 However, whether thinking entirely differently, one caution

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. two key questions highlight,

 next time meet? current Greenbook forecast turns mark,

 unemployment, production cutbacks areas demand weakened most, profit

 outcome.
 However, economy slowed trend, downside risks forecast

 significant decline equity prices response additional profit disappointments.
 second key issue face today relates possibility--and mind strong
 probability--that economy operating beyond sustainable capacity loss

 perhaps real issue level output relative potential confidence reading.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair, top can!
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. way top that! Mr. Chairman,
 Second District’s economy continues expand, though subdued pace time.
 Cost wage pressures persist, signs increases passed along
 consumers. Private sector employment grew brisk 1-1/2 percent annual rate October, bit
 third-quarter pace, despite declines manufacturing. Unemployment rates continue
 hold steady near cyclical lows. New York State retailers report same-store sales slowed
 somewhat early December running 2 4 percent ahead year ago, led book,
 record, specialty apparel stores.
 Available official private sector data make clear expansion slowing
 pace trend growth. Inflation seems quiescent, decreasing. Anecdotal evidence,
 however, overwhelming economy slowing considerably faster available data
 
 59
 
 indicate, anecdotal information forward-looking. economy view highly
 likely grow slower pace hoped achieve policy tightening.
 clear view balance risks shifted points concern
 economic weakness. Committee note realities world live
 would source instability. choice today, seems me, one two
 options. One reduction fed funds rate, probably 25 basis points, statement
 risks balanced concern inflation economic weakness. Alternatively,
 could leave rate go language expressing view risks weighted
 mainly toward concern economic weakness. prefer latter option two reasons.
 First all, it’s closer view. Secondly, gives us maximum flexibility

 therefore, something might deemed bit dramatic, sure

 market fully expects easing beginning next year, one question ask
 difference make ease rather wait. put question way
 around, difference make wait six weeks? It's hard imagine six weeks
 makes real difference. extent may make difference something
 expectations public attitudes. view, terms public attitudes expectations
 policy moves, ample data hand justify easing. is, don't think

 anyone would say making mistake acting point. hand, probably
 single prominent piece information we’re going get bears policy issue
 December employment report come beginning January. shows
 weakness--very low employment growth decline employment--I think great
 deal pressure, probably within Committee public large, us respond. Quite
 frankly, believe would better us anticipate development rather wait
 piece negative news. said before, think there's ample space rates move
 much space move down. So, would prefer see us position
 middle, indicated earlier.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, would prefer moving now. think funds rate
 high effect slow economy intended. view quarter point reduction
 rate would still leave us tight policy, one continues slow economy,
 yet would recognize risks we've talked around table. believe likely
 conference call lower rates point. certainly wait
 then.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, certainly accept recommendation.
 thinking possibility end last week, concerned markets might find
 bit confusing terms trying communicate. Ironically, turns out, article
 appeared Wall Street Journal may make less problem. addition, seems
 press statement carefully worded concern markets
 might little confused weak think economy might raise issue
 
 76
 
 didn't change funds rate today. So, decision written could important
 element terms success recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. slight difference opinion
 colleague, Mr. Parry, Wall Street Journal article. consider article unfortunate
 leaks like occur think makes us look bad central bank. We’ve
 discussion before. So, don't see good side it.
 Getting back subject hand, clearly situation we're concerned
 slowing wanted see seeing going excessive.
 others pointed out, one knows certainty whether weakening occur
 complexity economy interaction financial markets, consumer confidence,
 factors discussed. agree anecdotes point much lower rate
 growth models time. anecdotes, think we’d like see
 evidence data information receive would help clarify situation.
 period uncertainty like this, incremental approach seems appropriate agree
 recommendation change rates asymmetric statement risks weighted
 toward economic weakness time.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, thought article abominable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree! I.
 MR. PARRY. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, would prefer ease today. don't know
 scored note pad, go-around trying convey came view
 
 77
 
 balanced risk statement would proper first move. staff would tell
 debating left airport whether slowdown broad beginning
 sense whether uneasiness great sensed and, therefore, whether
 recommendation made would appropriate move.
 Vice Chairman McDonough captured view easing today--although suspect
 that's headed--is much soon. extent part going
 people recalibrating expectations 5, 6, 7 percent GDP related housing autos
 cruise ships whatever, think that's something ought let play out. think
 recommendation right one. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. support proposal reasons stated, Mr. Chairman.
 President McDonough indicated, it’s also important recognize don't know
 communicate marketplace something didn't intend convey moving
 point.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. know, policy suggested
 first choice. Obviously, lot uncertainty there, share view
 others around table think we've seen enough ease fairly soon. hand,
 agree stand telephones, [Laughter] policy suggested "morphs"
 would prefer, support basis. think ought alert stand
 telephones.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 
 78
 
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. certainly don't want predictable
 suppose regard.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Sorry that! reporting statistician.
 MS. MINEHAN. say consistency hobgoblin something?
 I'm also favor retaining particular policy solely move unemployment rate up.
 don't know NAIRU is; don't know whether anyone really knows right now.
 continue see resource constraints labor markets, constraint
 growth industries. think current slowing could potentially lead resolution
 whole problem.
 Another issue people focused relates financial conditions--widening credit
 spreads level real interest rates. I'm harmony Jack Guynn idea credit
 markets right reflective last loans made spreads really narrow 1997
 early 1998. environment generally healthy banking conditions, don't view
 problem. think bankable credits getting banked. real interest rates be?
 That's tricky question we’re moving period rapid growth one slower
 growth environment strong underlying productivity. it's hard look level
 fed funds rate right see problem itself.
 agree wait see. would able vote balanced risk
 statement, also go statement growing sense uncertainty side.
 think ought let strength that's still economy forgotten face
 largely anecdotal expectations-related data. could turn market receives
 today favorably. think wait-and-see attitude right one. Hopefully
 won't stand telephones!
 
 79
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, stand by, don't answer!
 [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. No, intend answering.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. generally support recommendation. Let briefly make two
 comments. First, share Bob Parry’s concerns statement risks weighted
 toward economic weakness going raise question didn't act now. Hopefully,
 language announcement least give sense reasons.
 Secondly, point I’ve made before, think soon ought consider putting
 least one nail NAIRU coffin. economy failed perform according
 framework last five six years but, far I'm aware, going back 15 16 years
 evidence empirical relation labor market conditions inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, let say first accept proposal.
 definitely recognize downside risks getting kinds messages everyone
 else. preference would balanced risk statement. concern move
 yet fully priced markets. think seen fairly
 aggressive move toward ease context historically low unemployment rate labor
 market situation tight historical standards. could set series expectations,
 could put us box confidence yet breached, use phrase, economy
 begins show strength going forward. accept proposal. would recommend
 
 80
 
 would hope press statement accompanies announcement includes language
 making clear yet panicking--that it’s foregone conclusion we’re
 necessarily going ease further. guess comment predictable! [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. "We yet panicking!"
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. don't think make press secretary!
 MR. BROADDUS. I'm expressing preferences!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jack Guynn said still debating
 left airport yesterday. I'm still debating now! Clearly, based said earlier,
 reason lowering funds rate we're waiting unemployment rate go up,
 can't agree that. press statement going make reference continued
 tightness labor markets, would disagree that. guess won't know
 press statement going say vote this. may guess will-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. tell preliminary press statement
 include reference.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay. reason moving it's awkward go
 balance risks toward inflation balanced risks statement, would seem
 tune reality. would find troubling. I've always thought whenever reached
 point announce balance risks toward weakness didn't act,
 going problem us. puts burden us explain didn't anything
 saw balance risks weighted toward weakness. didn't act going
 explained, whether press statement remarks people make subsequently.
 
 81
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May ask question? don't
 problem, matter direction see risks, every time move asymmetric
 statement?
 MR. JORDAN. That's don't like asymmetric!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. Sorry! [Laughter]
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. consistent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know!
 SPEAKER(?). predictable. [Laughter]
 MR. JORDAN. final point, speaking predictability, apparently
 expected would change language time, everybody could read
 would change policy next time. don't like predictable. [Laughter]
 would like unpredictable thing--what fully anticipated market today--and
 lower rate. think would give us lot mileage waiting ease it's
 well anticipated ease next meeting meetings.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation
 reason put forward, sense tended forgotten we've gone around
 table. period, believe, great uncertainty. think it's illegitimate us
 recognize uncertainty saying tend think risks one direction.
 hand, it's inappropriate wait little confirmation. originally thought
 complex set issues language forth, knew might get
 position. abominable terrible article Wall Street Journal, think get
 concept, lo behold world fall apart.
 
 82
 
 I'm actually comfortable exactly are. reflects uncertainty
 reflects reality tough conversation. markets think us foolish jumping
 based anecdotal evidence, warning them--or sense maybe comforting
 them--that awake alive things work certain way, we’re prepared
 respond. quite comfortable proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation. continue
 believe period below-trend growth constructive, I'm mindful downside risks
 face today. think one reason cautious moving immediately markets
 already anticipate move early next year cumulative easing 100 basis points course
 next year. don't think say anything meeting would disconfirm
 unwind expectations, neither believe would particularly constructive
 escalate further. So, think right move now. period uncertainty
 time incoming data may revealing, intermeeting move could certainly
 possibility.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Predictably, let say quarter point much, really think
 need get started earlier rather later. agree Bill Poole said
 current situation. One thing said going learn much early January except
 employment-unemployment numbers. actually decline employment last month
 household measure. said, Mr. Chairman, always make one move many.
 lowered funds rate quarter point now, we’d remove half last increase.
 expect act telephone, I'm afraid look decided point made
 
 83
 
 mistake today. hand, came meeting expecting outcome balanced
 risk statement better that! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think majority favor change rates
 balance risks toward side. Read appropriate language.
 MR. BERNARD. wording page 14 Bluebook: "The Federal Open
 Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability
 promote sustainable growth output. long-run objectives, Committee
 immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent maintaining federal funds
 rate average around 6-1/2 percent." balance risks sentence press
 release: "Against background long-run goals price stability sustainable economic
 growth, information currently available, Committee believes risks
 weighted mainly toward conditions may generate economic weakness foreseeable future."

 MR. KOHN. announcement?
 
 84
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh, I'm sorry. tells hungry am! [Laughter]
 MR. GRAMLICH. Could suggest change one word?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Sure.
 MR. GRAMLICH. seventh line begins "financial markets suggest
 economic"--it says "growth" I’d like substitute "activity." reason are, believe,
 still arguing mainly view continue midst productivity shock.
 think activity growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What's opinion? anybody support that?
 MR. GRAMLICH. I'd rather redundant misleading.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think people, unlike experts, understand
 growth activity.
 MR. KOHN. don't know whether slowing activity actually means decline.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Slowing activity means level distinct from-MS. MINEHAN. Yes, opposed growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. basically would saying economy
 going down. don't view.
