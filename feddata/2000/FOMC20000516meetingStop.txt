 Secondly, unless misunderstand nature program, picking

 may taken good deal Committee's time, think quite worthwhile.

 point going negative one. said above, don't think
 real interest rate link good line reasoning us use present deliberations.
 Whatever case equilibrium closed economy models, Committee confronted
 earlier challenge: stabilizing inflation. tried justify action long-run
 terms, theorist would find us blow whistle, especially since
 already raised nominal interest rates would predicted theoretical
 conditions. think instead focus narrower short-term goal stabilizing
 inflation, letting nominal real interest rates eventually find proper long-term levels.
 line thinking leads back inflation targeting approach
 trumpeted past meetings one probably getting sick hearing

 whatever takes achieve that. regard, would note situation worsened

 MR. FERGUSON. Let step staff role here. we've worked hard

 people thought foreseeable future encompassed something like lag

 so, would unreasonable say statement think risks balanced

 longer three months probably somewhere order year eighteen

 MR. JORDAN. May ask whether intended interpreted

 MR. FERGUSON. intended possibility, yes. also quite
 possible, though, might say taken tightening action still see

 Let address concern "sweaty palms." remember

 appropriate sustainable economic growth price stability. demand
 economy simply sustainable. worsened significantly since last meeting and,
 therefore, seems absolutely essential pick pace tightening.
 way leads believe going end 7, 7-1/4, 7-1/2 percent
 funds rate. don't idea going end tightening. think
 cautious make judgments carefully don't overdo
 tightening. That’s especially case given concern, expressed earlier,
 state euphoria among general public United States could
 subject rather rapid quick change. circumstance likelihood overdoing
 tightening side something keep much mind.
 today 50 basis points balance risks language
 indicating greater concern inflation, think would feed euphoria believe
 present time rather dangerous. would inappropriate do. So, think
 "sweaty hands" period "cool heads" period, believe
 right action take.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 
 89
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, everything said convinced 1/4 point
 seems right. Inflation taking fact lot evidence suggests easing
 expansion. Moreover, don't think validating market necessarily. think
 looking front us, 1/4 point asymmetric language seems
 appropriate. year ago 4-3/4 percent funds rate, better
 case moving aggressively sense put lot stimulus. yet
 cautious moving up. seems pretty good track
 policy actions preference, would stay track. I'll put view
 table consideration.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. strongly support recommendation, Mr. Chairman. think
 right arguments already made. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. I'd also like
 speak issue Tom Hoenig raised. think want careful confuse
 gradualism predictability. goal predictability extremely important,
 can't always make policy predictable. Sometimes going surprise market.
 think extremely helpful able markets much
 wavelength are. increase 25 basis points, all, market
 quite time. extra 25 basis points, fact opt 50 basis points today,
 market since ECI release. So, recent reports reflect policy
 assumption marketplace includes 25 basis points putting place
 
 90
 today, saying put market believes
 additional restraint necessary.
 News meeting consist three pieces. One piece funds rate,
 matching market expects, it's really news. second
 balance risks language and, given fed funds futures market, think
 matching market anticipates. main news meeting
 statement accompanies policy announcement. taste, going important
 message somehow says that, given know today, believe rates
 going continue rise. don't know far process going go,
 whether it's less Greenbook forecasts. Jerry Jordan rightly
 emphasizes, important go far. terms know
 now, don't think want give impression see end process.
 people may read 50 basis points, despite federal funds futures market,
 saying believe end tightening. view, would
 mistake since don't think that's evidence suggests today.
 would also like comment briefly vulnerability stock market.
 think know stock market still elevated historical standards
 volatility market really unprecedented. NASDAQ volatile
 year entire history index. market shaky. going help us
 market cracks. would cause us lot trouble. don't mean political trouble;
 mean trouble carrying forward monetary policy need do. So,
 think policy well line market expects, certainly
 provides guarantee, runs much less risk surprise market major way.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support halves
 recommendation. Let take one minute explain why. think business
 trying find mini-max solution, will, minimize maximum regret
 terms effects actions society economy. One way
 support market market sending us clear signals. said
 earlier remarks, long-term inflation expectations gone up. think reason
 market expecting us react today way consistent way
 looking long term. fact worked hard intermeeting

 strongly support President Jordan President Poole said I, too,
 sure far tightening process going go. But, fortunately,
 position make decisions one meeting time. today's
 meeting think 50 basis points balance risks statement tilted toward inflation

 now, Jerry Jordan right risks begin tip toward overshooting.
 respond that, can. right now, don't see it. still think
 go 50 basis points, asymmetric language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, seems clear need tighten policy
 meeting, enthusiastically support recommendation 50 basis

 inflation, incorporating view press release important part

 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. fully support 50 basis point move meeting.
 preference would say move risks balanced. recognize

 concern surprising market disappoint market
 times expects. know that; we've done many times before. prefer
 think situation sometimes take action
 communicate way educate markets get adjust us rather us
 adjusting market. So, least among us, going say balance risks
 tilted toward inflation funds rate moved still higher, wouldn't want
 think terms old tilt language. is, don’t want presumption
 going come back predisposed another increase June. think would
 desirable take stronger action time willing give time
 desired effects.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First Vice President Stone.
 MR. STONE. Mr. Chairman, support parts recommendation.
 think larger action Committee today forestall rise longer-term
 
 94
 expectations inflation. view, moving funds rate 50 basis points
 probably would lead long-term expectations increase inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. admit
 got decision rather different route did, nevertheless good
 end conclusion. concerned challenge much demanding
 slowing expansion trend. increase utilization rates signs
 building inflation pressures suggest ultimately going slow economic
 growth trend while. process much along, there's
 threat continued upward pressure inflation. think gradual approach we've
 taking far motivated possibility task might limited one-just slowing economy trend--and also fact recently hasn't
 sign rising inflation. Moreover, we’ve concerns uncertainties sustainable
 utilization rates. think always clear risks gradual
 approach. risks time trying slow expansion,
 imbalance actual potential output would become still worse threat
 inflation would become reality.
 seems aggressive policy action 50 basis points today
 risk policy mistake much smaller gradual policy response.
 we're sense today moving forward rate increase event likely
 would implemented near term. So, don't larger cumulative
 increase interest rates otherwise would had, put position
 implement larger cumulative rise turns justified. Thank you.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman,
 reasons stated around table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. I, too, support recommendation. think may seeing
 incipient signs slowing economy don't think it's enough.

 50 basis point move, different moves making, consistent
 them. reached point time appropriate action
 developments market. disagree little President Poole volatility
 downward trends we've seen market. fact things
 demonstrably fallen bed time--maybe road--but
 don't get sense volatility market downturns major impact real

 market, whereas earlier favor gradual approach tightening

 things haven't happened, window opportunity move

 think limit statement usual language much possibly
 can, saying risks tilted toward inflation foreseeable future, give

 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm fully comfortable
