 MS. JOHNSON. I'll submit euro, guess I'll throw out. [Laughter]
 MR. JORDAN. You'll never convince me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Cuban peso! [Laughter]
 MS. JOHNSON. Think problem Japanese economy confronting.
 I’m personally quite pessimistic Japan, don't think anything positive going
 happen time soon. people buying Japanese equities clearly feel
 differently felt while. people putting upward pressure yen feel
 differently. Japanese economy might appear restructuring recovering might
 appear offer returns road quite attractive. Nonetheless, Japanese
 current account surplus means exchange rates interest rates

 MS. JOHNSON. information New York Times

 MR. PARRY. Right.
 MS. JOHNSON. So, one possibility way give banks bit

 MR. STERN. Thank you. question simulations well, Mike.
 Greenbook shows baseline simulation flat funds rate simulation. look

 MR. KOHN. different time period. sacrifice ratio Bluebook

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mike Dave, respect simulations, let ask
 something think hinted around edges two three previous questions.
 Greenbook prepared last time December meeting, assumed increase 75
 basis points funds rate works. Greenbook increase 125 basis
 points. one looks simulations, analysis suggests behind curve
 
 44
 
 unless scenario 1 occurs. let ask think odds scenario 1 materializing.
 Everything else suggests behind curve.
 MR. STOCKTON. sure would characterize scenario 1 quite
 way characterized it. fact, one could argue--and think may President
 Jordan arguing--that scenario 1 fall behind curve sense even
 though inflation picking up, unemployment rate falling even
 equilibrium. Indeed, real federal funds rate falling even long-run
 equilibrium. scenario enjoying another period sustained, strong economic
 growth low inflation. still fair amount work done scenario 1
 terms adjusting policy point road order bring funds rate back
 equilibrium. Now, inherit lower rate inflation going process,
 certainly something benefits you. good news two-year
 period, still policy tightening done road. That, fact,
 longer-run Bluebook simulations showing.
 Now, terms probabilities, one judge probability scenario 1
 staff forecast errors recent years, one might say entirely implausible.
 [Laughter] Obviously, think relatively balanced set risks forecast.
 seen Chart 14, recent observation shows productivity still accelerating. So,
 entirely clear probabilities split right middle scenario 1

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, Second District’s economy

 manufacturing, consumer price inflation actually decelerated slightly. Unemployment

 serious vein, end last meeting stated would review
 incoming data closely signs imbalances. data we’ve received date suggest

 recent ECI data, even though measurements flawed understand it, suggest
 vigilance important. Similarly, latest information regarding personal income outlays
 suggests consumers continue willing spend beyond incomes, giving
 credibility optimistic survey numbers also worries regarding
 imbalances. respect recent GDP numbers, think well educated
 staff done independent analysis discovered fact
 relatively agnostic numbers. ones suggest

 make two observations. One staff expect shortfall earnings
 widening corporate financing gap, implicitly high volatility equity markets,
 well noticeably higher interest rates. suggests inconceivable
 expected returns investment might weaken and, conjunction that, amount
 
 70
 
 investment might weaken. leads one small internal inconsistency perhaps
 Greenbook, though understand got it.
 Similarly, Greenbook suggested significant increase shortterm interest rates. also suggested, spite that, equity markets tread water

 growing concern placid surface may disguise underlying turmoil. think

 market subject volatility, including significant downside corrections.
 considerations meant way counter various recitations

 like inflation targeting; not. say, what's big deal, already it.
 Others say way ever it. fortified consensus, [Laughter]
 unlike Al Broaddus, cannot wait tomorrow talk Bluebook! [Laughter] find
 exciting I’m going try draw three lessons exercise.
 first lesson, think, fairly obvious one. Since unemployment rate
 well structural estimate NAIRU, incipient inflationary pressures there,
 pressures counteracted fairly sharp, early rise funds rate.
 something think we’ve less suspected now, staff exercise still
 valuable showing high funds rate required stabilize inflation--something like 7
 percent. course, assumes models literally correct may want
 assume that. think take note general point.
 second lesson preemption good. Again, suspected that,
 staff exercise shows inflation-targeting funds rate rise another full percentage
 point wait see actual acceleration, hence get behind curve. Waiting
 lead larger variations funds rate. ounce prevention worth pound cure.
 third point present circumstances reversals seem be, least me,
 relatively unlikely. staff exercise assuming NAIRU 4 percent. None
 professional forecasters Larry Meyer recently surveyed paper prepared go low,
 though 4 percent within normal statistical distribution estimates
 estimate recent paper Brainard Parry. sake argument, staff
 assumes 4 percent right number works back optimal monetary policy.
 
 72
 
 still get funds rate rising 6 percent near future. Hence, even make
 early tightening moves old-fashioned, date view NAIRU,
 probability seems relatively slight eat crow reverse moves.
 One could also inflation targeting I’ll call pipeline method, looking
 prices lead final goods prices. PPI one measure. rose rapidly third
 quarter pretty stable since then, actually decelerating late 1999
 impact oil removed. Much true import prices. think bound
 rise point, time seem relatively stable. Commodity prices
 reversed downward movements beginning trend even apart oil,
 commodity futures up.
 Chairman often told us single important number unit
 labor costs based combination wage costs productivity. evidence still
 reassuring. recent ECI number suggests non-wage labor costs may trending
 still less increase labor productivity. point unit labor costs rising
 less rapidly and, fact, nearly stable. Chairman's
 important number, think it's also reassuring number pile data
 gotten intermeeting period. out-and-out inflationary spiral, rabbit wage
 increases beats turtle productivity increases every time, far turtle ahead.
 Next, let's look forecasters saying. Blue Chip forecasters
 actually pretty mellow individuals. average predicting rise inflation either
 final goods producer goods. predicting increases interest rates,
 seems inflation prediction based assumed policy tightening. Presumably

 Philadelphia Fed surveys forecasts prices also rising slightly. case it's impossible
 tell monetary policy forecasts based it's hard read evidence.
 let’s look bond markets. evidence could, think, worthy
 attention. example, interest rates 10-year bonds, nominal real, recently
 changed noticeably. year ago TIP real yield slightly 4 percent
 nominal yield 4-1/2 percent. noticeably skittish bond market time
 building little inflation premium. real yield gone 4.3 percent,
 even latest drop, nominal yield way 6.6 percent 10-year bonds.
 bond market building pretty hefty inflation premium, presumably due current
 inflation 2.3 percent so--a major change last year. potential undoing flight
 quality around turn year may partially complicate analysis, would
 Treasury buyback program. rising expectations inflation must prominent factor.
 obvious implication inflation may returning key economic phenomenon motivating
 bond markets, something think none us would like happen watch.
 inflation-targeting perspective then, model bond market
 seem vote tightening. forecasters hard read think
 pipeline method signals abstention.
 Finally, would like look conditions I'll call equilibrium
 perspective. stable growth economy inflation rates settled staff’s target
 2 percent, term premium bonds close zero. real rate TIP bonds
 alluded 4.3 percent. financial people think roughly 40 basis
 point liquidity premium TIP bonds, given thin market compared comparable
 nominal bonds. Hence, adjusted real interest rate might 3.9 percent so. Even

 stable expectations 2 percent inflation--an inflation rate would lucky achieve
 according staff--the equilibrium level nominal short-term rates
 order 5.9 percent stable growth/stable inflation economy. Present rates bit south
 think us, view feeling balance risks, would like

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. want share observations outlook
 shape views appropriate policy action tomorrow strategy could guide
 us going forward. Given uncertainty face trend growth, NAIRU, inflation
 dynamics, we’ve balance risk might fail take full advantage higher
 
 75
 
 trend growth lower NAIRU risk overheating, higher inflation,
 increased economic instability. probed limits new possibilities, risk
 overheating increased.
 first observation risks become significantly tilted toward
 higher inflation. judgment based still robust growth already high
 labor utilization rate, dissipation reversal favorable relative price shocks
 restraining inflation, signs incipient pressure nominal
 compensation inflation. consistent upward revisions trend growth
 growing appreciation importance higher productivity growth explaining recent
 macroeconomic experience, key challenge monetary policy today derives
 persistent imbalance growth supply demand. perspective
 monetary policy, absolute value trend growth GDP--whether it's 3-1/2, 3-3/4,
 4 percent, whatever--is less important relative growth rates demand supply.
 higher trend productivity growth appears simultaneous effects demand

 growth assumed 3.0 percent rather 2.8 percent, real GDP growth boosted nearly
 0.5 percentage point 2000 0.4 percentage point 2001, holding nominal funds rate
 nominal exchange rate assumed values.” So, 0.2 percent higher productivity
 growth results 1/2 percentage point faster growth basic demand. That's problem think
 facing.
 
 76
 
 second observation focus relative growth rates
 absolute ones, notwithstanding uncertainties comparison. points need
 tighten despite optimism trend productivity growth. Inflation prospects ultimately relate
 balance levels actual output potential output, relative growth

 next observation rise interest rates necessary balance supply
 demand contain inflation risks may initially smaller usual ultimately may
 larger boom featuring increase trend productivity growth. temporary
 disinflationary effect supply shock may first limit increase interest rates, given
 productivity upturn carries increase equilibrium real rate, cyclical

 hand, Humphrey-Hawkins report last July noted
 adjustment monetary ranges might needed rapid
 recent pace productivity growth persisted. fact, exceptional
 strength second half 1999, nonfarm business productivity grew
 estimated 3-1/4 percent last four quarters. light analysis
 productivity behavior recent years, staff revised upward
 estimates expansion potential output. Committee shifted
 using price stability ranges mid-1990s, potential output growth
 thought around 2-1/4 percent. However, staff estimates
 potential GDP growth averaged 3-1/2 percent last four years.
 Adding perhaps 1/2 percentage point upward bias implicit
 deflator, would imply nominal GDP growth 4 percent rate
 conditions price stability. ranges alternative II adjusted
 upward better aligned faster steady-state growth nominal
 GDP, assuming historically typical velocity behavior. shown chart 2,
 M2 velocity stable history, M3 velocity

 forecasts year appears 3-1/2 3-3/4 percent

 unemployment rate. growth rate potential, plus estimated
 inflation measurement bias, would close midpoint

 projection potential output growth 4 percent year
 next. Though higher implied potential growth estimates
 outside forecasters, productivity surprises generally
 side late. uncertainties reflected idea price

 adjusted ranges given alternative II, Humphrey-Hawkins report
 testimony could clarify revision reflects faster expansion

 growth going forward. could also stated additional information
 suggests different pace potential GDP, Committee could alter
 benchmark ranges again. addition, report could affirm
 adjustment ranges reflect change long-run goal
 stable prices signify greater weight would placed
 monetary aggregates formulation policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Bill?
 MR. JORDAN. troubled idea--I know said last year repeated
 here--that faster productivity growth means raise money growth ranges.
 
 83
 
 suppose 19th century discovered faster productivity growth, would
 said go dig gold faster rate. nothing inherent
 objective price stability trying purchasing power money
 says favorable supply shock raise money growth
 objectives. There’s reason cut money growth targets
 adverse supply shock. wouldn’t that. I’m sure back 1970s 1980s
 didn’t argue lowering targets. want view transitory effects
 acceleration productivity growth lower reported rate inflation transitory decline
 price level increase purchasing power money. would one-time decline
 price level--I don’t want use “D” word. supply shock goes
 away, would return toward sort balanced equilibrium would in.
 Also, don’t see follows leaving money growth ranges alone communicates
 important reduced weight give them. need
 change say paying attention them? changing
 mean don’t pay attention them?
 MR. WHITESELL. Perhaps respond that. think absolutely right
 case temporary supply shock. would expect concept long-run steady
 state condition altered transitory supply shock temporary increases
 productivity. If, fact, believe productivity growth surge experienced
 last four years transitory going go away soon, would reason
 alter long-run price stability. However, believe permanent component
 increases productivity, think people do, presumably would
 altering expected steady state growth nominal GDP. believe need
 
 84
 
 comparable growth rates of, say, M2 expected steady state growth nominal
 GDP accommodate kind steady state expansion, presumably would want
 adjusting long-run range aggregate.
 MR. JORDAN. part questioning linkage saying adjust
 nominal growth GDP; it’s sort nominal spending effect. point
 getting yesterday regard Dave Stockton’s simulation. clear ought
 explicit rather implicitly saying want monetary policy going
 “accommodative” nominal demand increases real supply-side favorable
 development. going that, let’s also think implications
 symmetric matter. surprising adverse supply shock, would
 then? Would say “Let’s cut money growth targets”? Probably not.
 MR. KOHN. permanent nature, certainly. productivity growth shifted down,
 1973, order achieve Federal Reserve’s goals stable prices maximum
 employment, FOMC time--though goals set forth Federal
 Reserve Act time--should shifted targeted M2 growth rates down. question
 steady state nominal GDP growth? steady change rate
 growth productivity expected persist rather one-time change,
 consistent Bill said-MR. PRELL. sense logic applied logic got
 current targets. It’s recalibrating targets new, longer-term trend.
 MR. JORDAN. would agree said case
 ability distinguish adverse oil shock 1973-1974 something much later
 profession came view secular trend call productivity. don’t know
 
 85
 
 ability know experiencing given time allows us make judgment.
 Committee certainly 1970s.
 MR. KOHN. late, right. think certain extent observe
 going on. see things like oil shocks, dollar appreciation depreciation, excise
 taxes, whatever might change price level see ongoing change
 productivity, agree takes time recognize. Committee struggling
 last several years. four years since appears retrospect

 saying best guess is, Bill said, permanent component change

 MR. MEYER. think issue this: goal stable money growth stable

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. may okay.
 MR. MEYER. may okay. goal, understand it.
 operate mandate achieving price stability, think indicates necessarily zero
 inflation least stable inflation rate. make choice.
 MR. WHITESELL. Chairman mentioned, given midpoint existing
 range 3 percent, take estimate potential output plus measurement bias-implying nominal GDP 4 percent consistent price stability--that means aiming
 deflation 1 percent per year.
 MR. JORDAN. agree that’s arithmetic implication. start
 period price stability. started price stability later found
 acceleration productivity growth, would one thing. that.
 acceleration productivity growth we’ve started positive rate
 inflation, somehow measured, means deceleration inherited rate
 something moving toward price stability. juncture today concerns
 like registered yesterday staff others, would afraid
 message changing ranges would convey. Rather communicating
 going put emphasis achieving higher rate growth, would seem say
 willing accommodative acceleration inflation. could say
 accommodating faster productivity growth. might even persuaded
 
 87
 
 right thing do. think message would heard
 accommodating faster inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Suppose say explicitly issue?
 say trying find range price stability envisage potential
 growth risen. And, therefore, things equal, ranges go objective
 remains several years ago.
 MR. JORDAN. sure credibility say believed;
 not. know people wouldn’t believe said that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t believe that! seriousness, think--and
 may wrong this--that extent raise question, capacity
 minutes Humphrey-Hawkins report speeches make say essentially
 nothing changed--that fundamentally goal price stability. potential risen,
 necessity, unless change income velocity, money supply goals
 different. said, it’s arithmetical truism.
 MR. MEYER. think easy attribute adjustment range productivity
 nobody actually believes goal setting range pure price stability.
 Nobody believes goal price stability. So, view, people think
 accommodating higher inflation raise range.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. question related much discussion going
 on. alternative II, think said midpoint 4 percent M2 consistent
 shift productivity also goal price stability. So, potential output growth would
 4 percent area price stability would defined zero inflation. guess
 
 88
 
 troubling nominal GDP 4 percent, means goal zero GDP
 deflator. went around table, nobody would give number.
 MR. WHITESELL. I’m sure answers question,
 suggesting 3-1/2 percent potential growth observed-MR. PARRY. Oh, see.
 MR. WHITESELL. --that plus ½ percent measurement bias. words,
 measured GDP deflator would ½ percent, true inflation would zero.
 MR. PARRY. Well, group happy with, I’m really happy.
 MR. KOHN. That’s way ranges constructed last five years-that is, reasoning arithmetic mind. Committee might want think
 whether wants change that. consistent
 Committee doing.
 MR. PARRY. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. think explicit numbers involved would good
 thing us do. Suppose say long-term goal 1 percent deflator
 estimate 4 percent real growth potential, adds 5 percent.
 would right me. fear, however, without explicit
 inflation goal, people read 5 percent--given prices creeping bit
 pressures side--as indicating going accommodate
 somewhat higher inflation. message would giving. would fear
 explicit.
 
 89
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. clearly side. question
 people read accommodating inflation, argument moving up,
 think, unambiguous. point may case, problem.
 MR. POOLE. Well, said, willing explicit
 long-run inflation target estimate potential growth is, think make
 argument. believe should. I’ve said think much
 explicit inflation target. view, would constructive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. essentially saying price stability goal.
 want numerical judgment price stability. issue?
 MR. POOLE. Yes, given I’ll call “revealed preference” way
 actually behaving, think market believes perfectly satisfied
 inflation rate somewhere neighborhood right now. that’s little
 would regard zero inflation, properly measured, taking account biases
 indices. best guess something like 1-1/2 percent CPI 1 percent
 deflator, taking account measurement biases, pretty good estimate zero inflation
 really is. somewhat right think market believes
 quite happy somewhat above, evidenced revealed preference terms
 decisions made.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. bought changing ranges

 MR. GUYNN. would like join Bill Poole Al Broaddus comments

 not. particularly absence target, believe much smarter leave

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want go back question
 portion discussion. page 20 Bluebook, Don, talk 2-1/4 percent
 trend productivity growth opposed something high-MR. KOHN. trend potential output growth Committee first set
 targets.
 
 92
 
 MS. MINEHAN. Oh, yes, excuse me. 2-1/2 percent trend productivity
 growth?
 MR. WHITESELL. Currently it’s 3 percent.
 MS. MINEHAN. much upward revision result change
 NIPA numbers?
 MR. WHITESELL. much actually, part staff’s current
 estimate potential output growth mid-1990s--through second quarter 1995--is still
 2-1/4 percent. current estimate last four years, contrast, 3-1/2 percent;
 4 percent going forward. ratcheting potential output growth
 estimates structural productivity, second quarter 1995 moved
 2-1/4 3-1/4 percent. beginning 1998 potential output 3-3/4 percent
 beginning year we’ve predicted 4 percent.
 MS. MINEHAN. mid-1990s potential output growth
 somewhere around 2-1/4 2-1/2 percent full percentage point higher that?
 MR. WHITESELL. estimate still second quarter 1995
 potential output growth 2-1/4 percent. Starting year 1-3/4 percentage
 points higher 4 percent.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 MR. PRELL. case, we’ve done little extrapolate recent
 experience near-term period. thinking might want adjusted
 ranges, one question would assumption potential GDP growth. Would
 want rest assumption experience past years--where behavior
 unemployment rate relative GDP, example, would seem consistent potential output
 
 93
 
 growth somewhere 3-1/2 percent range little higher? would want look
 forward optimistic way assumption 4 percent?
 MS. MINEHAN. understand exactly want do. trying get
 handle effect NIPA revisions. knew effect--a tenths
 percentage point--from NIPA revisions themselves.
 MR. PRELL. tenths came change.
 MS. MINEHAN. I’m thinking communications issue.
 MR. PRELL. Sure.
 MS. MINEHAN. portion productivity change really fallout
 revising numbers better way, presumably result NIPA changes, something
 would help communicating reasons change.
 MR. POOLE. Cathy, could comment quickly that: doesn’t change
 nominal. NIPA revisions done change split real output
 prices. respect revisions really bear issue.
 MS. MINEHAN. change productivity.
 MR. POOLE. That’s right, offsetting change inflation number.
 Essentially changed split nominal.
 MS. MINEHAN. realize that. isn’t point.
 MR. PRELL. forward-looking, relevant thinking bias adjustment
 price measure, going on, switching one component
 nominal GDP, would wash.
 MR. WHITESELL. Back mid-1990s think perhaps bias closer
 percentage point, whereas it’s ½ percentage point.
 
 94
 
 MS. MINEHAN. it’s ½ percentage point, thinking terms
 looking forward, ranges supposed doing. different
 productivity number, part think different past--because change
 break price bias underlying real growth--then gives us non-policy
 oriented reason making change thinking growth rate money.
 said, think people commented communications difficulty
 point, particularly environment think outlook inflation
 biased side. evenly biased; upward bias. Whatever want
 say risks, everyone around table yesterday talked underlying pressures
 economy. don’t think anybody satisfied existing state. inflation number
 looks okay, direction likely moving not. difficulty
 communicating reasoning, change ranges, tend say something
 willingness accommodate conditions exist right now--unless,
 people said, want get lot precise.
 MR. WHITESELL. terms communications issue, President Minehan,
 inform public last July change ranges might coming
 adjustments assessment productivity.
 MS. MINEHAN. know did.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. walked really quite
 agnostic issue. know matter people feel strongly,
 interested hearing sides. come conclusion perhaps better course
 leave well enough alone--not make change stage--for variety reasons. Jack
 
 95
 
 Guynn raised one reason important. course year, suspect
 fair amount scrutiny core policy matters, would prefer
 go period explain monetary aggregate issues, frankly
 terribly important us right now.
 Secondly, whole issue, also come up, numerical inflation
 targeting. happen one think qualitative inflation target
 served us well. see reason open debate, think would
 course reaching decision change ranges.
 third thing worries me, listen conversation, also force
 us sense explicit Committee views productivity
 productivity trend. I’m sure hearing consistency among Committee
 members issues.
 Finally, believe lesson learned central bank
 colleagues around world position talk defend
 actions vis-à-vis happening growth monetary aggregates. particular,
 ECB, put weight money growth perhaps have,
 lambasted week week newspapers allowing M3 growth
 target. think much better position clearly said putting
 much weight aggregates, M3 growth may may targets.
 frankly prefer quite clear communications. enough issues
 need clear. leave one alone course year, think
 much better shape, given things likely doing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 
 96
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. associate Governor Ferguson’s
 wise remarks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Well, different perspective, suppose. must say
 interesting discussion far think identified two issues relevant
 target ranges. first whether revise reflect faster rate growth trend
 GDP. second implicit inflation target use set midpoint
 revised range.
 Alternative II deals first issue believe perpetuates possible
 misunderstanding inflation target pure price stability, adjusted estimate
 inflation bias. Now, say possible misunderstanding Committee fully
 discussed preferred inflation rate certainly hasn’t worked achieve consensus
 point. strict price stability target implicit target range today, might
 ask question: really make us look like central bank focused price
 stability around world like central bank least transparent inflation objective?
 think latter.
 offer alternative III set ranges incorporates view implicit
 inflation target, set midpoint M2 growth rate, reflect I’ve called price
 stability plus cushion. Although remains lot uncertainty precise value
 trend GDP growth might evolve next several years, think current
 monetary growth ranges outdated badly need revision. Now, comfortable
 judgment reflected alternative II ranges updated reflect assumption
 trend GDP growth currently 3-1/2 percent. Humphrey-Hawkins report testimony
 
 97
 
 emphasize FOMC reconsider setting monetary aggregate ranges
 incoming information leads us revise estimate trend real GDP growth. is,
 instead thinking monetary growth ranges carved stone, use
 digital--subject costless adjustments response flow new information.
 Let turn second issue, undoubtedly controversial one.
 think sending implicit message define price stability set
 ranges. try escape reality, doubt successful. change
 ranges, many people already indicated, may result probing implicit
 inflation target. Clearly, go exercise explicitly set ranges.
 question present public: blur logic, ignore issue entirely,
 transparent it? think main--and maybe only--purpose monetary
 aggregate ranges today means offer implicit inflation target. perhaps
 view today’s discussion ranges opportunity internal discussion
 set inflation target consistent interpretation price stability.
 might also look discussion decision today opportunity another step
 direction transparency.
 want point that, view, subtle real difference
 “explicit inflation target” “inflation targeting.” understand central bank
 conduct monetary policy achieve price stability without establishing inflation target
 consistent interpretation price stability. Given want markets help us
 achieve target, also value explicit it. believe accept
 explicit inflation target without sign specific strategy achieving that,
 interpret “inflation targeting” be.
 
 98
 
 countries price stability mandates explicit numerical targets
 uniformly set ranges centered I’ve referred price stability plus cushion. This,
 view, appropriate option, light concern deterioration cyclical
 performance near zero inflation zero nominal interest rate valve. Therefore, offer
 alternative III range centered preferred midpoint 5 percent. reflects sum
 3-1/2 percent rate trend growth GDP, ½ percentage point estimate bias chain
 measure price index GDP, 1 percentage point cushion. suggests 3
 percent 7 percent range. would small step take toward explicit inflation target
 enhanced transparency, would big step Committee take.
 give alternative strategy here, would set central range
 rather point, bottom point consistent pure price stability upper
 point consistent price stability plus cushion. case, central tendency might 4
 5 percent. Attaching symmetric range central tendency would yield range 2
 7 percent M2. analogous Australian approach setting “thick” point target
 2 3 percent. problems, particularly indecision M2 growth inside
 central range. would allow us defer precise setting midpoint
 consensus could reached Committee perhaps consultation
 Congress.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Don?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Don, I’d like hear thoughts Greenbook

 would suggest inflation premium maybe 1-1/2 percent one’s analysis backwardlooking 2 percent forward-looking. would suggest Bluebook

 stimulative mode. Bluebook saying?
 MR. KOHN. Bluebook extension Greenbook forecast, Chart 3,

 MR. KOHN. think fair message, illustrated Chart 4 certain

 Secondly, noted President Jordan, see inflation--these four quarter changes,
 it’s one quarter’s worth inflation--you need respond fairly robustly, twice
 robustly Taylor rule would respond. circumstances
 uncertain supply side economy you’re experiencing favorable supply
 shocks, outcomes bad. certainly better act incorrect

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 
 117
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Don, suppose half comment half question,
 premised idea simulations useful. think useful, especially
 making comparisons particular simulations. I’m Chart 3 want compare

 expected order get much difference would move
 strongly year order preempt inflation expectations. raises question mind
 whether structure model takes adequate account credibility issues effects,
 thought might want comment that.
 MR. KOHN. structure basically assumes credibility. is, unless Federal
 Reserve changes, structure assumes 2 percent target, public knows
 2 percent target. long following policy actions flow
 target--so confirming period period public’s perception
 target--then expectations firmly anchored. happens, partly follows
 
 118
 
 response President Stern yesterday sacrifice ratios, Fed
 deviates actions public expects with, say, 2 percent target, public begins
 change expectations. gives different sacrifice ratios short run. gives
 different effects short run. public would slowly learn 3 percent
 target instead 2 percent target 2001. think part difference
 nominal rates aren’t different, that’s case real rates. tightening
 2001 gets bit ahead rise inflation, real rates considerably higher 2001,
 large extent builds extra restraint.
 MR. BROADDUS. That’s good point, especially end year.
 MR. KOHN. Right. So, there’s almost percentage point extra restraint end
 2001 persists next year so. significant amount extra restraint.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. said yesterday, liked exercise. time, think
 humble. actually added dimension humility goes
 productivity debate. always thought whatever rate productivity,
 positive shock--that is, productivity went up--that would good news inflation.
 would make economy generally less inflationary. Larry Meyer made point yesterday
 think right. You’ve said past, too, Mr. Chairman. link supply
 demand, necessarily so. could get situation, illustration Larry gave
 yesterday indicated, productivity shock would actually inflationary or,
 suppose, could neutral. putting humility table here, think
 also ought humble that! Even change productivity, don’t
 necessarily know going price forecast.
 
 119
 
 MR. KOHN. see Chart 6 positive productivity shock
 tend lower inflation rates short run unless targeting inflation rate hard.
 think one needs differentiate short-run effects longer-run effects. Let’s say
 short run productivity shock, consistent Dave Stockton’s
 charts yesterday. Inflation would tend go profit margins swelled, competition
 would drive prices down. time, however, demand feeds back. lowers
 unemployment rate, wages begin catch higher productivity, end
 higher equilibrium interest rate approximately equal size productivity shock.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Don, two comments. One, you’re uncertain whether

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. “Balance risks.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. balance risks toward inflation. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, fully support
 recommendation, let make comments. issue clearly whether
 nothing, whether firm 25 basis points 50 basis points. agree
 either case would use balance risks language indicating
 concerned inflation. think look ourselves. reality
 perceived everywhere around world best central bank business. highly
 regarded, highly respected. commitment price stability, certainly defined
 speeches testimony, think unquestioned anywhere. style strong, silent
 leader, one moves incrementally. move 25 basis points time systematic
 way. move 50 basis points--to continue analogy, sudden strong,
 silent leader starts beating chest show tough guy is--what would
 
 128
 
 conclusion? believe would scared! frightened about?
 certainly go business normal way, continuing exhibit confidence
 earned performance. think thing contribute
 stabilizing economy. agree fully working hypothesis
 series tightening moves appropriate, believe
 background thinking. feel strongly 25 basis points combined
 balance risks statement toward inflation concerns far right package today. Thank
 you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, certainly also support recommendation.
 faced powerful, real forces want allow run extent
 terms increasing productivity, employment, real income without upsetting inflationary
 apple cart. would like relate comments morning discussion yesterday
 trade deficit. trade deficit also part real adjustment going
 economy fundamentally nominal phenomenon. trade deficit financing
 capital flows coming country rate return high. cannot
 object policy determined real forces unusual,
 certainly context postwar U.S. history perhaps much back that.
 think move 25 basis points statement balance risks toward

 anticipated move. saw interest rates rise. federal funds futures prediction
 market four weeks more, anything leaves market
 wondering to. go 50 basis points balanced risk
 
 129
 
 statement, markets would likely say concluded done.
 certainly conclusion. want make market much work
 possible, lead way, help us figure correct response incoming flow
 information. absolutely agree likely mean sequence 25 basis point
 increases meeting. wouldn’t correct say Dave Stockton's famous language “as
 far eye see” but, nevertheless, quite time. working cooperatively
 market think best chance coming without big upset.
 So, support recommendation 100 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would prefer 50 basis point increase funds rate
 also public statement focusing heightened inflation risk future.
 concern time period meeting next meeting March 21st quite
 long. might suggest something would make comfortable 25 basis point
 increase agree assess situation end month.
 considerably data, certainly data prices. could review data
 see feel time move appropriate. don't see
 constrained fixed calendar, case involves quite long interval
 meetings. 14 years Fed, found telephone meetings
 times like useful. perspective, though it’s certainly one shared
 everyone here, would reduce possibility get behind curve.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. option telephone conference always
 table. always been. It’s needed employ while.
 obviously there.
 
 130
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, think might case time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. markets tell us. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation
 entirety. seems me, given kind technology productivity shock had,
 real interest rates need rise. extent, occurred. judgment
 need go more. see way accomplish raising funds
 rate. So, ¼ point increase certainly acceptable me. would go beyond
 aggressive, principally considerations uncertainty. seems
 uncertain future path productivity uncertain NAIRU. personally
 uncertain whether latter useful concept all. uncertain
 implications increase real rates already occurred effects may turn
 be. So, think suggesting ought do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, support proposal completely. believe
 increased risk inflation there, think ought say it. Also, much favor
 25 basis points several reasons. First, models show direction, agree
 don’t show precision, think proceed gradually. Secondly,
 environment core inflation modest, need recognize
 begin pave way higher rates. thirdly, imbalances remain there,
 trying take account, don’t want shock system either. think
 continuing steady path appropriate approach. Therefore,
 support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 
 131
 
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation 25
 basis point increase funds rate continue call asymmetric posture.
 also agree likely implement series tightenings year;
 likely appropriate make move meeting period time. Given
 uncertainties trend growth, NAIRU, inflation dynamics, also given uncertainty
 impact policies financial conditions broadly, think strong
 case gradualist approach. hope able use bias announcement
 accompanies today’s action skillfully. mean hope don't undermine
 view sensible expectations rise funds rate built term
 structure futures markets.
 lot discussion today uncertainty, structure economy
 inflation dynamics, value humility. don’t want lead discussion
 opposed humility. [Laughter] However, think sometimes draw implication
 humility suggests inaction, though certainly arguing, Mr.
 Chairman. want bring us back discussion monetary growth targets
 seems monetary growth target regime danger inaction much less
 funds rate regime. that, think, consistent points President
 Jordan making. productivity growth little higher, end little lower
 inflation; somewhat limited won't much problem. interest rate
 regime inaction very, dangerous--and particularly dangerous expansion
 driven higher productivity, raises real equilibrium interest rates.
 also want comment bit discussion role wealth effect.
 clearly important. go productivity upturn, wealth effect
 
 132
 
 consumption, excess demand growth relative supply growth. we’ve lot
 discussion, number arenas, declining equity premium
 higher equilibrium growth rate raise value equity prices. lot partial
 equilibrium analysis. plug formula low equity premium voilà--higher
 equity prices. makes little sense general equilibrium model,
 model wealth effect ultimately generate increases real interest rates
 significantly cap diminish increase equity premiums.
 think danger facing recently monetary policy
 somewhat slow tighten allowed economy operate partial
 equilibrium world. think going see equity prices evolve general
 equilibrium world, think one reason bit cautious gradualist.
 want make comments perceive consensus strategy
 unfolding. seems talking preemptive
 slowing economy trend growth, reactive get trend
 growth stabilized unemployment rate. point prepared
 reactive respond evidence higher inflation. struggling
 issue whether appropriate strategy, perhaps even optimal strategy, given
 uncertainty output gap. sensible strategy, think gaps details
 fill in. Obviously, decide appropriate path funds rate
 slow economy trend. also keep mind unsuccessful
 slowing economy trend and, therefore, output gap rises even further, affect
 policy tighten otherwise would. is, tighten
 enough slow economy trend push output gap back down.
 
 133
 
 think consistent nonlinear rule discussed past. uncertain
 output gap, uncertainty whether beyond economy’s
 potential diminishes greatly output gap increases based best estimate
 potential.
 third issue think going focus strategy
 aggressively move higher inflation. extent
 weighted response increases output gap, inflation rises
 aggressive would otherwise be. way think get trend
 growth unemployment rate stabilizes, assumed policy setting
 strategy consistent stable inflation output gap basically zero. inflation
 begins rise, respond increase inflation way ordinarily
 would, also revise estimate output gap. requires aggressive
 response inflation would otherwise case.
 So, thoughts least shape views strategy going
 forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree halves
 recommendation. think reinforce markets right think
 right expectations. Secondly I, like others, moved uncertainties
 talked about, also recognize inflation appear stage verge
 virulent outbreak. move 25 basis points seems moderate appropriate. think
 you're absolutely right suggesting time continue look
 reaction markets generally, including asset markets think, said yesterday,
 
 134
 
 likely underlying turbulence. Finally, outlook sentence believe
 statement suggests risks balanced toward inflation obviously right one use
 take back things we're doing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. agree recommendation ¼ point think need
 convey view tightening ahead us. best guess
 significant amount tightening coming year. may well time series
 tightening moves move ½ point going appropriate. today think ¼
 right. basic product one confidence--confidence we're going
 appropriate keep economy right path. today's environment 25 basis point
 increase funds rate captures indicates that, yes, know tightening
 appropriate. We're going needs done. neither going underreact
 overreact. think important image strong, confident central bank
 public deserves put confidence in.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, pretty much Bob Parry is.
 tough call but, druthers, preference would go full ½ point. would
 decisive move would preempt inflation expectations might either building
 likely build near-term future. recognize would strong move, particularly
 context need asymmetry whatever do; agree fully point
 score. So, recognize risks. big risk might get market break
 could lead would refer disorderly plunge stock market. would
 complicate situation make difficult us take kind steps need
 
 135
 
 take. able accept ¼ point increase morning. would hope
 might call “asymmetry plus.” need language. Also, would hope--and
 expect you’d inclined testimony, far road--that
 underscore intensity watching developments readiness
 move aggressively fact need so. Also, hope line,
 would hope Board Governors might consider complementary discount rate increase
 near future. Furthermore, agree Bob Parry. know intermeeting conference
 call always table but, context remarks, hope watch market
 developments carefully signal call.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. First, data point: talked yesterday difference
 ten-year bonds nominal real spread. match developing
 synthetic yield!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. didn't it! colleagues
 end table.
 MR. GRAMLICH. using chart, Exhibit 18, staff sends around every
 Monday. rendering, certainly last month rise inflation
 premium. Kohn persuade way overstated yesterday. Nevertheless,
 gone up.
 second thing would like say tend agree Bluebook
 simulations inflation targeting, humble models. believe
 likely need lot tightening, real question deal today
 get here.
 
 136
 
 support recommendation 25 basis point move tilt implicit
 gradualism. recognize benefits strategy. I'm delighted thought strong
 silent leader! [Laughter] think make good point, Mr. Chairman, economy
 many ways fragile, things could change rather abruptly, past record
 good calling turns, that, therefore, chance could overreact.
 regard, thought tilt connection Roger Ferguson’s Working Group,
 one thing like tilt. easily reversible. raise rate 50 basis
 points, discovered much reduced 25 basis points, would look though
 didn’t know doing. 25 basis points tilt new data come
 indicating economy strong thought, take tilt. looks
 know we're we're looking data. That’s nice advantage
 tilt I’m glad using situation. So, number benefits
 gradualism strategy. recognize support recommendation.
 said that, costs gradualism strategy. could
 moving little late. historical precedent that, too, think ought
 keep mind.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. look financial markets
 tellingly me--or maybe importantly tellingly me--I see Treasury yield curve upward
 sloping bit two years five years. Beyond five years it’s downward sloping,
 corporate bond yields mortgage rates 8 percent. would hard pressed say
 wrong levels environment outlined Greenbook associated
 expectations. would feel much firmer ground saying something wrong
 
 137
 
 market levels if, given second-half experience 5-3/4 percent real growth and,
 depending inflation measure, nominal spending 7-1/2 8 percent, thought didn’t
 add up. says market building kind real growth plus
 inflation inherited second half last year year. So, don’t know
 nominal interest rates need go up. inflation turn adversely accelerate
 seems built marketplace right inflation expectations beginning
 rise, think would undesirable real rates go down. would think
 nominal rates would need increase.
 front end curve, though, look rise rates securities
 maturing two years, leave feeling 5-1/2 percent overnight
 interbank rate low consistent. closing gap somewhat would wisest
 thing do. taking step today, think, appropriate.
 comment, though, question 50 basis points versus 25 basis points,
 requires make reference discount rate. time, think
 still case, movement funds rate accompanying increase discount
 rate interpreted lasting move opposed move funds rate alone.
 Given that, would think 50 basis point increase funds rate discount rate change
 strong. since consider directors’ recommendations discount rate increase
 appropriate environment, would prefer ¼ point funds rate knowing
 accompanied discount rate move. fact, would oppose 50 basis point change
 funds rate either discount rate increase without it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Board Governors meeting later vote
 discount rate. President Guynn.
 
 138
 
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. came meeting intention
 inclination argue 50 basis point tightening, think staff presentations
 heard yesterday comments made around table would certainly support that. believe
 evidence mounting inflationary pressures. probability inflation moving
 clearly increased view. biggest worry consensus go 50
 basis point tightening, would inclination slide back balanced risk statement.
 eloquently pointed out, want be.
 support ¼ point tightening today balance risks side
 inflationary pressures. guess already answered question, let say I, too,
 would really like see Board consider discount rate increase. think gives
 directors ownership policy action reinforces action taking.
 view reasonably high probability step pace terms
 policy actions meetings come. support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. table today’s Wall Street
 Journal. don’t know many people saw it, listed series possible Fed actions
 today, gave odds likely market reaction. different scenarios
 we’ve talk about--an increase funds rate 25 50 basis points, tilt without,
 on. last line table rate cut Fed. odds “as likely
 Cubs winning World Series.” [Laughter] likely market reaction “holy cow!”
 [Laughter] found upsetting. Obviously, chance going lower
 rates today, Cubs fans always optimistic!
 
 139
 
 Mr. Chairman, support recommendation strongly. think strategy
 incremental moves excellent one, supporting markets right helping
 confirm inclinations. seems clear move today, would
 jeopardize expansion would also jeopardize credibility well, important.
 note outlook assumes fed funds path decidedly upward
 drift forecast horizon. even strong upward tilt, project deterioration
 inflation outlook. Regardless whether look core PCE core CPI
 measures mentioned yesterday, inflation still going up. judgment,
 increase 25 basis points going enough forecast horizon. believe,
 said, thinking series moves make sure correct imbalance
 aggregate demand aggregate supply. think it’s also important say
 balance risks tilted higher inflation exactly reasons explained
 articulately.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One thing came meeting
 determined end asymmetric directive, whether went
 25 50 basis point increase funds rate. I’m glad appears going
 that. imagine people, gave thought might recommend
 meeting, would thought would clearly side 50 basis point move.
 must admit I’m frequent debates myself, much demand side
 equation--I don’t think anybody doubts strength demand--but elements
 supply richly portrayed Kohn’s different graphs. I’m becoming much
 believer view potential productivity stay flat current high level
 
 140
 
 grow future better thought was. don’t know NAIRU is.
 forecast, forecasts we’ve Boston require great deal jiggering
 done try capture bit uncertainty know feel people
 apparently feel supply side. also think interaction markets presents us
 series risks talked about. tried incorporate discussion
 yesterday, respect buildup imbalances terms credit, related rising asset
 values. So, two things mind, sense risk sense uncertainty
 economy’s actual capacity, I’m comfortable move 25 basis points.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation reasons
 expressed. think it’s exactly right thing do. want say feel
 good deal identification remarks President Broaddus others around table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. support parts recommendation. far future
 concerned, hope keep looking data make decisions one step time
