 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions colleagues?
 MR. PARRY. Dave, past year core CPI 2-1/2 percent

 two indices almost exclusively due imputed prices non-price services like bank
 services. Given that, index think providing best indication core inflation?
 MR. STOCKTON. don’t know whether that’s leading question not! [Laughter]
 Actually, said past, believe would mistake rely single index.
 So, tried analyses present pros cons
 various indexes you, policymakers, consider order reach kind judgment.
 judgment would pickup underlying core inflation. core
 PCE probably understated pickup imputed prices,
 statistical constructions actual measurements. It’s quite conceivable CPI
 overstated acceleration part because, noted, doubts

 last year CPI showing much sharper acceleration medical
 services prices PCE, uses PPI measure rather measure used

 MR. MOSKOW. David, question productivity. know

 anticipating slowing going forward. wonder you’ve given thought to--or
 done analysis on--whether cyclical slowdown productivity different
 time, given we’re starting low unemployment rate. Also, thought
 whether going affect way separate structural productivity
 cyclical productivity?
 MR. STOCKTON. I’d say we’ve given thought hard-core analysis
 question. Obviously, one could imagine would see greater cyclical weakening
 productivity tight labor markets, firms perhaps would reluctant shed workers
 given hard get people payrolls. would one argument
 even sharper deceleration cyclical productivity, perhaps, showing
 forecast. could, then, consequences well corporate profits. hand,
 don’t know much cyclical behavior labor market might

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. two technical comments simulation occasioned
 last discussion. I’ve trouble since I’ve baseline assumption

 quite anything, hard know exactly mean. One thing Dave said,
 probably thought hadn’t, assumption may

 us understand could explanatory footnote--I’m necessarily going ask another
 simulation lot already--on baseline funds rate assumption compares

 second comment don’t know you’ve ever actually done funds rate

 Obviously, would show, taking baseline forecast, lot growth

 MR. GRAMLICH. again, maybe easier policy simulation,

 MR. REINHART. think trying sorts things, also

 MR. GRAMLICH. But, course, it’s market generating futures

 MR. REINHART. don’t clear road map for, say, exchange value

 private employment growth, still highest District, fallen considerably--from
 
 29
 4-1/2 percent rate mid-1999 2-1/2 percent now--and growth clearly exceeds
 rest District.
 Manufacturing activity flat October District, although capacity
 utilization remained relatively high. Looking forward, District manufacturers
 lowering expectations. manufacturing survey revealed second consecutive downward

 productivity gains sustained environment. may also help explain shift

 Residential construction activity continues cool District. Excluding
 Colorado, single-family housing permits fallen four consecutive quarters, leaving

 Energy activity, contrast, continues course benefit higher energy

 Labor markets overall remained tight, little change wage

 November, difficulties hiring--especially construction workers.
 Manufacturers seeing higher input prices able pass costs

 Let turn national economy. incoming data confirm, Dave already

 think consistent staff said briefing today--my view downside
 risks economic activity increased somewhat. believe growth slowing trend
 likely outcome. also believe greater downside risks stemming recent
 developments, I’d like tick would highlight. First, financial conditions
 tightened downturn economic activity softened corporate balance sheets.
 Also, higher interest rate spreads we've talked today, tighter lending terms

 increased aversion risks speculative investments. Junk bond default rates up,

 Turning national economy, recent developments encouraging

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. News Seventh District
 similar reported last time. We’re continuing get reports slower activity
 large number industries. Although list industries reporting slowing activity
 changed much since early October meeting, economic activity Seventh District still
 high levels. Tight labor markets led much pickup wage gains, although rising
 health care costs remain big concern competition still prevents firms passing along
 higher energy higher labor costs.
 Retailers reporting moderating sales gains several months, may
 one reason many apprehensive critical holiday shopping season ahead.
 latest survey Michigan retailers, example, showed merchants expect sales
 higher season number retailers projecting sales gains expected sales
 growth lowest since started survey six years ago. reports indicate
 promotional activity heavier start earlier holiday season last year.
 
 38
 Light vehicle sales slow October, particularly light trucks. auto
 industry contacts indicate early November sales relatively soft well. Big Three
 contacts note desire pull back somewhat costly incentive programs, although still
 used, particularly models inventories excessive. Recently means
 incentives offered light trucks, models unprecedented.
 High inventories also factor automakers’ decisions cut production schedules
 temporarily closing plants, cutting third shifts, and/or reducing overtime.
 Unemployment insurance claims risen lately Midwest, part due
 temporary layoffs auto industry discussed earlier well claims made
 workers indefinite layoffs Firestone plant Decatur, Illinois. Despite rising claims
 reports truck drivers easier find, labor markets still tight.
 anecdote Iowa, unemployment rate 2.3 percent, one example: Circuit City,
 retailer, decided stop selling appliances. Amana, one suppliers, announced
 layoff 260 workers. end day announcement made, however,
 human resources people found new jobs nearby firms 260 workers

 Turning national outlook, recent data consistent

 Now, focusing prices wages, moderation demand might seem

 case, especially one looks labor costs wage benefit figures. Wage growth
 October jumped annual rate 5 percent, well 3.6 percent average rate
 year date. persistent tightness labor markets, ECI 4.6 percent
 last four quarters. believe that’s biggest four-quarter increase ten years;
 compares 3.1 percent previous four quarters. Also, productivity growth
 nonfarm business sector slow 3.8 percent annual rate third quarter. agree
 Bob Parry could worse, drop 6.1 percent second
 quarter 5 percent average last year so. result, unit labor costs rose
 2-3/4 percent annual rate third quarter remaining roughly flat extended
 period--in fact, four previous quarters. think that’s worrisome, view unit
 labor costs could increase further. continuing labor market tightness could easily cause
 compensation growth rise productivity growth might slow further. regard,
 think it’s notable first time long time, Dave, revised downward
 structural productivity projections--not lot, it's change direction. think
 
 45
 could see slowing cyclical productivity growth along lines suggested Michael

 So, aggregate demand appears growing slowly--and think that's
 clearly constructive standpoint longer-run health economy--the bottom line

 take one granted. Oil prices high core measures inflation risen 1/2 percentage

 Turning nation, basic outline Greenbook’s GDP forecast next

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First Vice President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. one exception regional economic
 conditions Fourth District changed little since Beigebook report. Growth rates
 several industries, particularly manufacturing, appear moderating toward growth rates
 typical average growth rates seeing throughout expansion.
 one exception Beigebook report retail sales, outlook become notably
 bearish. Retail sales figures early November disappointing. Retailers tell us
 sales menswear leading indicator retail sales general, concerned
 recent weak selling pace category foreshadows softening consumer demand
 critical upcoming holiday season.
 Now, according Beigebook national summary, economic activity Fourth
 District slowing bit faster nation whole. little doubt
 firms District poorly. However, reasons poor performance seem
 peculiar industry firm rather economy-wide business slowing.
 example, heavy truck manufacturing industry experienced reduction output 40
 
 54
 percent last year's record high levels. lessening demand trucking
 services caused drop; fact, truck freight tonnage grown all-time high.
 Rather, conditions peculiar truck manufacturing industry responsible slowdown.
 First all, oil price shock hit trucking firms’ capital spending budgets especially
 hard. Second, trucking companies difficult time getting loans. fact,
 contact banks singled loans trucking firms dangerous ones past
 fixed price contracts made diesel prices skyrocketed. Finally,
 anticipated trade-in values dropped, it's harder truckers justify buying new trucks.
 truck production declined substantially, truck shipping not.
 District that’s characterized larger concentration manufacturing activity
 nation whole, tend hear group somewhat disproportionately.
 manufacturers continue tell us cannot raise prices matter hard try-and you've heard several others morning--and becoming increasingly
 concerned competitive environment. fact, cite intensifying cost
 pressures Greenbook notes: higher energy prices, higher health care costs, higher
 labor costs tight labor market, especially skilled labor.
 steel industry provides powerful example going on. Inventories
 steel quite high industry characterized excess capacity around world.
 Steel imports flooding United States. Conditions become bad
 integrated producers plant shutdowns and/or layoffs within year likely couple
 directors point outright bankruptcies question conditions don't
 change. Competition prevented prices manufacturers rising even situation
 
 55
 prices raw materials increasing. Chemical firms, example, report even
 though higher oil prices greatly increased costs, they’ve unable raise
 selling prices.
 Now, take reports manufacturers seriously, also want put
 perspective. ex food energy basis, goods prices measured CPI
 increasing annual rate 1/2 percent past three years. it's surprise
 manufacturers see inflation lurking around corner. Yet overall core CPI
 continues accelerate. culprit services sector, may less susceptible
 import competition, less prone productivity increases and, course, larger component
 labor inputs goods-producing industries.
 brings national situation. Greenbook says economy
 essentially balance--in sense level economic activity roughly line
 potential. think Greenbook good job expressing caution crept

 policy adjustment thought prudent, 50 basis point increase fed funds rate

 share concern, perhaps reasons different
 underlying Greenbook projection. I'm concerned confuse people
 
 56
 definition price stability willingness pursue it. year mark fifth
 consecutive year core PCE increased rate less 2 percent. Last
 year's rate 1-1/2 percent result led many people say achieved price
 stability. core inflation measures year last year Greenbook
 correct, we'll see creep next two years. statistical test
 run median CPI, core measure developed Bank, indicates
 inflation trend changed expansion. Similar analyses we’ve run
 core PCE lead us conclusion. we’ve added Greenbook projection

 one hand, many already said, continue high oil

 others already noted, labor markets obviously remain tight.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. pretty well beyond question
 economy slowdown, leaves us clearly facing new, quite different questions
 grappling recent years. fact new questions
 precisely ones would anticipated earlier year thought ahead
 dealing emerging slowing economy make easier answer
 hand. two fundamental questions see operative today first, deep
 long-lasting slowdown prove be? second, inflation flatten tight
 correlation slowing economy continue drift up, driven momentum
 earlier conditions and/or perhaps economy slow enough long enough?
 Concerning slowdown, evidence around us.
 examining morning quite possible weakness foster weakness.
 Governor Gramlich Presidents McTeer Hoenig listed factors could cause that.
 
 69
 believe may bit early get overly concerned downside potential. still
 substantial strength there.
 Let cite factors. openers, view Greenbook forecast hardly
 considered weak. Consumer confidence remains high perhaps rising again.
 consumer spending weaker third quarter considerably stronger robust
 second quarter. general seems holding well. Job creation continues--slower
 hardly anemic--and incomes continue rise. stock market stalled, except
 egregiously overvalued stocks months ago, still quite elevated historical
 standards holding well far despite plenty excuses crater. Business
 investment likely slowing earlier unsustainable pace shows sign collapse.
 Fiscal policy likely become stimulative new president, regardless
 may be. economies trading partners group projected continue grow--at
 around 4 percent--which cushion incipient decline here. Certainly potential exists
 situation weaken quickly perhaps even precipitously, I'm sure that's
 likely scenario today.
 Concerning inflation, see happening low base sluggishly
 clearly moving up. Perhaps today's high productivity environment might
 easily reversed prior eras. feel longer uptrend goes on, harder
 stop. economy reaccelerate soon, inflation may well accelerate it.
 interrelationship compensation costs productivity continue key,
 energy prices. watch closely, course. Fortunately time watch

 Finally, core inflation long-run target increase

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 
 88
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, first agree hold steady
 federal funds rate. would prefer balanced risks statement, let give
 logic argument.
 seems way monetary policy works today maintain
 firm medium-run long-run commitment low stable inflation,
 consistent that. time, tremendous amount short-run
 stabilization depends market changing interest rates response short-run
 developments. case, seems want market feel free
 move rates response current developments direction developments
 demand. concerned set expectation market,
 exists today, near-term easing prospect. That's expectation
 that's built federal funds rate futures. would like see statement that’s
 neutral respect possibility market could move readily
 either direction.
 think careful reading much TIPS spread.
 view TIPS spread measure credibility, extremely important.
 don't think necessarily means policy tuned right. could cite contrary
 case--namely 1982, policy changed dramatically markets didn't believe
 Fed going stay it. inflation expectations slow come
 took long time expectations catch reality
 policy was. thing could happen today. don’t think want assume
 TIPS spread shows we've got policy right.
 
 89
 would prefer statement make clear risks
 balanced, inflation risk gone away. Indeed think, anything,
 near-term inflation risk gone somewhat, could say. Rather, risks
 balanced outlook output employment side changed.
 agree critical issue combination statement balance
 risks clause statement. would like leave market message
 don't see reasonable prospect policy easing next meetings,
 think going tenor way market interpret message.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, would prefer balanced risks statement,
 reasons perhaps similar Bill Poole’s. think upside risks
 inflation, addressing. That's fed funds rate level

 MR. FERGUSON. I'm sorry got quickly! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. want pass?
 MR. FERGUSON. No, don’t want pass. reason said I’m
 actually sympathetic points Presidents Hoenig Poole made.
 think we've worked hard honest transparent market possible.
 really think risks balanced, say risks balanced.

 came meeting--the statement introduced strikes fair
 description are. sense it's quite am, believe
 fair description Committee think gets message across
 without creating uncertain risks. So, I'm supportive statement even though
 understand concerns others raised.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, certainly support recommendation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.

 MR. MCTEER. would strongly prefer statement balanced risks,
 think inflation risk diminished, risk side

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I'm comfortable proposition you’ve
 put table, subject whatever editing press statement decide do. I’ve
 scribbled whole page notes support change bias, thinking
 going level discussion. I’ll spare everyone else
 arguments.
 concluding thought, though, going believe long-term
 consequences deterioration inflation would far serious
 damaging economic outcome short-term loss output. response
 comments, hypothesized inflation expectations haven’t moved because, according
 surveys, people expecting us counting us cap inflation levels we’ve
 even move lower. would like reserve right come back make
 longer arguments if, course next minutes, weight opinion
 shifts toward side balanced statement. I'm comfortable
 proposal you've put table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'm sorry, say want make

 MR. GUYNN. I'd like come back give rest arguments
 favor retaining bias, fact comes that.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree completely
 recommendation keeping balance risks toward higher inflation
 language read. agree President McDonough central bankish type
 language, maybe I've long, thought well stated!
 [Laughter]
 Let make couple comments. think point can't act
 tilt without influencing financial markets time important one.
 
 94
 market obviously read statements carefully; we’ve seen
 interpreted last statements. changed verb, think, one sentence little,
 read very, carefully, saw gradual move. bit
 counter President Poole’s point, think market read proposed statement
 move toward easing, although obviously much removing tilt entirely.
 Also, want associate around table earlier
 expressed concern fiscal stimulus increased government spending
 result gridlock. happened fall clear indication could
 going road, would lead fiscal stimulus.
 finally, want say going recount, would like
 speak first us Chicago know handle recounts! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’ve heard rig numbers
 beginning, won't recount.
 MR. MOSKOW. many different ways accomplishing-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't want hear more! [Laughter]
 President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. support proposed statement. I, too, came prepared
 long list arguments remain terms

 behind it. recognize may seen long-term major changes
 inflation expectations, Fed must remain vigilant possibility focus
 markets continued concern inflation. Given tools Fed’s
 
 95
 disposal, best way us ensure maximum sustainable growth stay focused

 essential Fed maintain credibility, believe proposed statement
 that. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First Vice President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. also agree recommendation. Like others,

 reason concerned objective achieving price
 stability. like others, also spare statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also agree
 direction policy recommendation, i.e., change funds rate,
 tilt recommendation. think Gary Stern summed thoughts issues quite
 completely. shouldn't overreact fact expansion slowing. wanted
 slow. don’t know potential is. financial markets happen
 means slowing. It's important recognize statement, it’s
 also important keep focus still remaining inflationary risk fact
 need economy slow address risk.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. last thing want
 inspire bunch lectures side table, [Laughter] support
 statement. indeed close call me.
 
 96
 time, let make two points. think getting close
 point risks nearly balanced perfectly balanced. think
 Occam’s razor principle respect press statements. get
 thoroughly parsed everybody view lot said simpler
 better. come nice approach I'll call downside/upside
 approach, think work. think pretty careful
 point I'd like go back strategy risks really balanced,
 ought say so. four friends argument—Bill (Poole), Tom (Hoenig), Roger
 (Ferguson), Bob (McTeer)--and would join list, though supporting
 statement.
 point markets. I'm sure understand well
 market reaction be. certainly possible would spark rally
 don't think anybody wants see that. said, couple
 scenarios go way. One could factored in, case
 move balanced risk statement won't much markets. Another possibility
 markets may think see something don't, markets could
 actually go down. idea scenarios likely. think
 little careful locked irons, will, market
 reaction. point think right thing try
 explain it, think markets come around.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, strongly favor policy position you’re
 recommending, asymmetry. would underline Gary Stern said.
 
 97
 thought made interesting observation, namely would difficult
 point explain would change balanced statement. think would
 encourage markets expect beginning cycle easing,
 view would increase upside risk.
 Also, would go back something Governor Kelley said economic
 discussion, thought put quite well. It’s early get overly concerned
 downside risks. many quarters general
 consensus aggregate demand growing rapidly potential.
 one quarter may growing somewhat slowly potential. Frankly,
 think that's healthy. could follow Ned Gramlich’s medical analogies,
 wouldn't want anything point undercut therapy.
 far statement concerned, think one really gets exactly right.
 believe nuances exactly right. So, I’m “yes” counts.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation respects.
 Specifically, think retain statement unbalanced risks. thought
 statement read excellent.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Time vote.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. It’s time vote, indeed. Would
 read appropriate language?
 MR. BERNARD. wording comes page 12 Bluebook. “The
 Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster
 price stability promote sustainable growth output. long-run
 
 98
 objectives, Committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets
 consistent maintaining federal funds rate average around 6-1/2 percent."
 balance risks sentence, heard introductory words,
 rest would read shown here: “Against background long-run
 goals price stability sustainable economic growth, information currently
 available, Committee believes risks continue weighted mainly toward
 conditions may generate heightened inflation pressures foreseeable future."
