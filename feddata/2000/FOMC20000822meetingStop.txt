 Finally, might note couple points, Mr. Chairman.

 Finally, looking market data, based 10-year TIPS seems though

 Also, least compared June, composition borrowing shifted back banks,

 know Orphanides’ work policymakers analysts generally felt

 NAIRU concept invented--was around 4 percent. Basically, policymakers felt NAIRU
 4 percent; turned lot higher, policy proved excessively expansionary. One
 could make superficial comparison today. Today FOMC behaving NAIRU around

 table suggests following: earlier period core PCE, said
 reconstructed hindsight, went point year’s time. risen
 one-third that. discussed reasons recent rise, least point
 think agreement relatively little rise reflects true acceleration. Unit labor costs
 rose sharply earlier period largely sharp rise wages. Productivity actually went
 slightly time. recent period, know unit labor costs dropping,
 slight rise wages offset sharp rise productivity. Michigan survey 1-year
 inflation expectations rose two points earlier period one-fifth now. even
 1-year expectations could misleading recent period long-term 10-year
 inflation expectations stable, series available back then. Nominal 10year Treasury rates rose 8 basis points 20 basis points now. meaningful

 period. nominal-real spread could measured back mid-1960s.
 backward look shows many respects earlier period looked one would expect
 world inflation gradually increasing.
 
 60
 respects, recent period looks different. FOMC may
 making mistake now. obviously can’t yet claim contrary, risk inflation
 accelerating seems far less back 1966. policy advice follows

 long-run NAIRU, could still rapid increases inflation unless supply

 think keys understanding role productivity forecast
 two fundamental issues. One effect productivity aggregate demand well aggregate
 supply. know staff argued, think persuasively, last four years
 increase productivity actually increased demand supply, resulting decline

 moving balanced increases demand potential supply. That, think, supported
 modest tone economic indicators relatively subdued path equity prices
 recently. important element upside risk certainly could get
 repetition pattern last four years, acceleration productivity
 actually brought even sharper increases demand.
 second effect one particularly want focus on, temporary
 disinflationary impetus comes whenever acceleration productivity. Now,
 beginning learn complex dynamics associated increase productivity

 using here, though implicit staff forecast well. really don’t lot

 want focus on, then, power persistence temporary

 So, seems framework helps explain acceleration

 too, 3-month rates went up. Well, fed funds rate one-day rate. ask myself:

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Don? not, let get started. think
 fairly general consensus observing marked slowdown growth

 situation lot things could fairly significantly worse, not. conclude

 time, would highly risky judgment depart bias used call
 “asymmetric toward tightening.” still learned language using describe
 policy bias! event, cost-benefit analysis stage

 risks toward higher inflation. would like put table discussion. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.
 want talk bit balance risks sentence using press statement
 
 77
 opposed asymmetry language previously directive, much
 benefited change. think mainly accomplished convince
 marketplace--and slowly economists marketplace--that fact looking
 longer run meeting meeting. convinced Federal Reserve
 looking monetary policy affects economy longer period time. Therefore,
 balance risks statement toward either inflation one side toward weak economy
 other, believe, considerable positive effect ability carry policy.
 certainly change need us take action action appropriate.
 is, think, lingering debate within Committee need order
 high credibility. Basically, think need reputation good judgment
 courage--the judgment evaluate risks reasonable way decide right course
 action courage take action. easy make right decision perfectly
 obvious is. never case us. always looking dark glass,
 thinking best thing acting courageously it. view
 Committee very, high reputation regard something immense
 importance us.
 Today think clearly look economy way suggested.
 agree maintaining present stance policy appropriate and, certainly, continue
 reflect view balance risks toward rising inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. would say policy
 right tight issue whether ought tighter. certainly wait see whether
 case. One comment bias: suggestion, wonder consider
 
 78
 taking lone reference tight labor markets reason bias. don't know
 one-to-one mapping inflation time horizon talking about. Given
 comments, well others today, seems see risks
 important right leading us bias. think also ought considered, certainly
 tight labor markets given consideration statement
 risks.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. can’t speak everybody. think moving
 direction don't think yet. believe labor market still overwhelming
 problem clearly less proportionally was, certainly last meeting.
 MR. HOENIG. view something ought consider go forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think valid issue raise next meeting.
 President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, went airport yesterday morning Bozeman,
 Montana fly back meeting little concerned whether flights would
 running time. asked clerk whether would able get back Washington
 meeting. I’m sure know said: “Tell Alan Greenspan leave
 economy alone.” [Laughter] Apparently agree support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I’m comfortable support recommendation.
 Absent big surprise, think luxury letting play out. would underscore
 Bill McDonough's comments anything detract notion
 watch prepared move need to.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 
 79
 MR. SANTOMERO. support proposal change fed funds rate retain
 statement balance risks side higher inflation. think need time
 see happening real economy. Nonetheless, balance risks appears remain
 side higher inflation horizon. indicators inflation point consistently toward
 higher inflation, respond, think remind markets resolve
 regard.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation. think would
 good time leave funds rate unchanged see things unfold considering
 another tightening action. also believe important retain statement adopted June
 balance risks continues toward higher inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation change funds
 rate maintain assessment risks still unbalanced toward higher inflation.
 want give perspective unbalanced risks issue.
 Whenever acceleration productivity growth, following choices:
 take temporarily higher output take potentially permanently
 lower inflation. think far done take form higher output. Core
 CPI inflation today exactly end 1995 methodologically consistent
 basis. fine. would argue particularly vigilant upward creep
 inflation going forward productivity acceleration effect dissipates, inflation
 rise. better rise takes place level closer long-run inflation objective
 level already drifted it.
 
 80
 second reason acceleration productivity classic opportunity
 opportunistic disinflation. So, seem little strange allow extraordinary experience
 acceleration productivity accompanied upward creep inflation.
 reasons, think need stay statement unbalanced risks. think unbalanced
 even though inflation performance remains favorable, believe vigilant
 rising inflation going forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation, especially
 recommendation keep tilt place. think would premature remove it. Also, Tom
 Hoenig’s suggestion resonates hope look near future.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. I, too, support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, including bias
 toward concerns heightened inflation going forward. indicated earlier, think
 additional time assess situation, given current real interest rates believe
 far need even longer run.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Mr. Chairman, support parts recommendation. think
 Larry Meyer made useful cautioning remark given productivity shock, benefiting
 little good luck, will, inflation. different good luck 1998
 good luck. keep mind alert. always argued alert
 possibly be. luck comes shapes. don't want overdo nostalgia bit,
 remember times oil prices went much last couple years
 inflation situation far worse now. remember investment booms like
 
 81
 inflation situation far worse. So, really take situation apart,
 might see also forces working direction high inflation may
 appreciating. don't want push theme hard think remain vigilant.
 talk luck, easy count things one side fence things
 side fence.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. also agreement recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 think wait see data economy shaping up--slowing perhaps--and
 productivity trends seem developing latter part year. I, too, think balance
 risks statement vitally important. view would send difficult message
 markets deal retain existing balance risks statement. believe risks
 side. like way Governor Meyer put analysis terms questioning aren't
 seeing inflation moving productivity surprise aren't seeing
 look ahead productivity surprise. worrisome me. would like us
 associated fiddling Rome burns, don't think are. think time
 afford wait see.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree parts
 recommendation. think time pause take stock. seen slowdowns
 temporary expansion picked quite rapidly. question
 whether slowing growth sustainable would enough cap inflation whether
 economy really grow rates trend order relieve pressure
 built up. Obviously open question. inflation data deteriorate due energy
 
 82
 discussed, reasons, demand expands beyond potential output, think
 prepared act quickly. believe appropriate follow advice.
 certainly agree balance risks clearly tilted toward higher inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. agree leaving funds rate unchanged point
 right thing do. also sensitive communications issues involved; would
 desirable communicate expectation going raise funds rate
 foreseeable future imply next change might rather up.
 challenge avoid communicating that.
 Regarding language balance risks, part would like say
 statement always unavoidable, permanent feature fiat money system
 balance risks toward higher inflation. [Laughter] ain’t going it’s going up! since
 likely win one, think spend little time
 leads us believe balance risks toward higher inflation. say
 discussion today previous meetings sounded worry higher
 productivity various avenues--through demand increases, wealth effects, higher real interest
 rates, liquidity injected central bank--causes higher inflation. Governor Meyer
 suggested, worry lower productivity causes higher inflation. So, sort little
 better whether higher productivity causes inflation lower productivity raises risk inflation,
 quite ready explain think risks toward higher inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 
 83
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support parts
 recommendation. feel bit drawn discussion communication balance
 risks, spent nine months working number trying sort out. probably
 shouldn't act feeling, will. First, certainly commend always listened
 wise counsel Vice Chair, agree actually succeeded extent
 communicating something here. quite sympathetic Jerry Jordan said, though.
 Tom Hoenig said also relevant: view number things leading us
 communicate think risks foreseeable future toward greater inflation.
 reasons labor markets, one say without necessarily firm
 believer particular number respect NAIRU. So, comfortable keeping
 reference labor market. like Tom Hoenig, think hearing broader
 range concerns elements real economy--and case, maybe
 others, bit financial conditions. don't sense
 change communication tool meeting. view Jerry quite appropriately reminded
 us worked hard get language--not thought easy
 difficult problem thought going help public analysis
 policymaking. So, go forward course year--regardless
 interest rates--I think clear driving assessment risks. say
 give market chance look things looking at.
 we're looking past unemployment numbers factors, least ought signal
 market best can. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. support recommendation.
 
 84
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would Secretary read appropriate language
 directive statement balance risks toward inflation?

 Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability
 promote sustainable growth output. long-run objectives, Committee
 immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent maintaining federal funds
 rate average around 6-1/2 percent.” statement press release would read:
 “Against background long-run goals price stability sustainable economic growth

 toward conditions may generate heightened inflation pressures foreseeable future.”

 MR. GRAMLICH. Could raise one point? think statement fine. don’t want
 talk that. point increasingly TV programs seeing comparisons
 
 85
 said last meeting saying today. wonder it’s possible, since us
 don’t remember exactly press statement said last meeting, could little
 reminder changes made statement?
