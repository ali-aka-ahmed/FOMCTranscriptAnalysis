 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Peter? not, would someone like

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval domestic operations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, turning page 3 handout,

 credit spreads widened 1998 highs beyond; tenyear spread relationships among private credits become much less
 stable. bid-ask spreads Treasury securities widened.

 repo rates. included next three pages several charts
 use discuss points.
 top panel page 4 simply shows background yields
 5-year, 10-year, 30-year U. S. Treasuries since January 1992.

 process gets way, would expect see breakdown
 correlations within yield curve. However, certainly
 true, market benefit hindsight
 experiences this. abruptness changes rapidity
 breakdown really dramatic altering pricing
 relationships market relied many years. So, think
 suddenness breakdown needs understood partly
 reflecting fact market seeing breakdown
 relationships 30-year bond transient event, perhaps
 episodes volatility across page were. real
 question minds market participants whether relationships

 top panel next page three credit spreads
 10-year Treasuries. corporate spread, using Merrill Lynch A-2
 index, shown red; swap spread dark blue; agency
 spread, Bloomberg index noncallable debt--that is,
 straight 10-year debt--is light blue. see recently
 spreads widened beyond levels reached
 fall 1998. Looking whole eight years’ worth data,
 adjustment spreads since 1998 looks much less like onetime shock even series shocks little like resetting
 spreads higher levels. Indeed, since fall 1998, three
 spreads traded roughly double averages
 prevailed 1994 August 1998. It’s little that,
 rough approximation spreads almost doubled.
 Clearly, attributed directly decline

 point seeking votes two proposals, Mr. Chairman.
 First ask suspension paragraphs 3 6

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter, listened read
 materials, technically speaking requesting temporary extension?
 MR. FISHER. correct.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. practical matter, though, setting
 framework would make rescinding extension virtually impossible end
 day. exaggerate part. If, example, Committee decide behest

 MR. FISHER. tried structure proposal way allows exit

 pace? much time get point large block

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, merely asking point

 happen Treasury go specific path SOMA go specific

 involved difficult confrontation. want avoid that. want see issues resolved
 make major changes look exit strategy. said exit
 strategy, hear it. heard two particular problems.
 MR. FISHER. would create, Committee approves I'm suggesting,
 rolling book 30-, 60-, 90-day forward RPs rather modest size. Small amounts would
 mature every day, would ladder would accept case Treasury, agency
 debt, mortgage-backed collateral. would take relative pricing Street
 gives us avoid disturbing spreads. experience longer-term RPs get
 mainly agency debt mortgage-backed collateral little Treasury collateral. fact,
 ability get Treasury collateral currently decays overnight. is, get mostly
 overnight Treasury collateral. soon talking 3-day 4-day RPs, Street
 want give us Treasury collateral. involves rolling buildup could
 unwound, think, without causing shock one week even one-month period.
 would roll rather gracefully, Committee wanted.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suggesting really

 MR. FISHER. $20 billion underlying reserve need now. face
 significant reserve demands April tax season. would hope issue
 resolved hit tax season, frankly, give us flexibility.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think tax season begins?

 leave comfortable all.
 One way thinking conduct operations System
 Open Market Account monetizing government debt--the liability side
 balance sheet effect non-interest-bearing government debt. asset side hold
 interest-bearing government debt effectively canceled. Boy
 Scouts, Peter, Wright Patman used say could burn bonds hold nobody would
 know difference. true government debt effect
 canceled activity. broaden willing monetize,
 something quite different leaves uncomfortable. So,
 alternatives rather continuing operations agencies, really would like pursue
 them. Anything! would almost rather monetize state government debt, think, I'm
 sure either.
 MR. FISHER. That’s certainly one alternatives. would possible
 Committee today give Desk authority go full extent allowed statutorily.
 Federal Reserve Act would permit us foreign currency swaps; also allows us take
 state municipal debt anticipation revenues--so limit set state local debt.

 mine. care consequences. alternatives, want

 MR. GRAMLICH. favor thorough study, overseen consultative basis

 wise add this, question. understand it, problem getting
 repo market, gets us agency market, way want
 reinforce so-called federal subsidy. real risk. And, understand it, that’s
 Treasury's problem. municipal debt there, apparently part legal
 authority purchase. got market, either outright purchases using
 debt collateral repos, wouldn’t generate similar kind subsidy state
 local market? already tax subsidy area, doesn't make whole problem
 lot worse? missing something?
 MR. FISHER. No, don't think so. problem wherever sit
 displace lot water. doesn’t matter whose obligations are. problem
 
 - 21 -
 
 sit somewhere. present giving subsidy Treasury agency
 debt mortgage-backed bonds; spread around. settle municipal
 debt, would give market little kick well. cannot avoid consequences.
 MR. GRAMLICH. end amount subsidy give depends part,
 presume, size market, right? we're buying holding collateral tiny
 proportion given type obligation, subsidy much less.
 MR. FISHER. Yes.
 MR. GRAMLICH. So, whoever else get this, think
 relevant number determine consider might amount subsidies--if
 convert basis points--given cannot total purists we're going
 subsidize something. little sea exactly important subsidy is,
 given going subsidy. say, answers. think
 question unless somebody persuade otherwise.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. also favor study broader range assets

 MS. MINEHAN. No, know good idea either. one thinks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. certainly favor study think suggestion Tom
 Hoenig made constructive. deal somewhat issue Bill Poole raising,
 possible temporary suspension extended shorter period? words,
 study sufficient importance ought done much expeditiously perhaps
 decision could reached much quickly?
 
 - 23 -
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let suggest probably good idea.
 reason we’d report extension minutes involves formal
 change one Committee’s instruments, Authorization Domestic Open Market
 Operations. would create attention discussion issue suspect want.
 think important consideration formally conclude
 policy moving toward. officially handled far less important general sense
 going. So, would prefer truncate Peter's authority regard
 presumably Committee requests, meeting every six weeks.
 MR. HOENIG. May ask question little differently? Let ask Peter
 question. need extend temporary authority study completed?
 important effective conduct open market operations waiting study
 done address issue critical? basic question terms study.
 MR. FISHER. I’m sorry memo speak clearly enough point.
 temporary extension lapses, narrow issue. scheduled lapse April 30th
 thereafter would able take Ginnie Maes. could still take Freddie Mac
 Fannie Mae issues, straight debt mortgage-backed securities. Now, many years
 taken straight debt and, therefore, “favor” Freddie Fannie
 none Ginnie. current authority lapses, go back status
 taking straight debt Freddie Mac Fannie Mae minor agencies taking
 nothing Ginnie Mae. Given concerns, seems one perverse ways
 go. part avoid perverse outcome want extend authority.

 collapse tactical strategic decisions simultaneously. sense way
 least harm handle tactical issue, basically provide
 temporary extension Peter study goes on. Anything strikes me,
 Peter said this, highly risky perhaps sending wrong messages.
 time recognize study needs done broader implications,
 Chairman indicated. would little concerned broader strategic concerns
 forced us withdraw authority already there, could send confusing
 messages knows reaction. So, think least harmful action
 continue temporary authority study. sometime later year
 make broader strategic decision.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, think wise. Let suggest following.
 One, take upon see expedite Treasury’s decisions process

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. making lot major decisions,

 MR. PARRY. move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. second?

 earlier. Another productivity issue, dominant
 important role think economy going forward whether taking
 right action. third factor output gap model based--and cyclical
 factors NAIRU influencing it. Would discuss minute weight
 factors? I’m wondering one dominating thinking model
 affects rationalize position going forward.
 MR. PRELL. complex question, I'll try brief possible. Let
 cite basic premises. One real interest rates financial conditions general
 evidently tight restraining growth aggregate demand. think
 observing performance economy consistent that. Second,
 believe--more case years ago--that period
 productivity growth improved may well improve somewhat fundamental
 sustainable fashion. may giving us favorable short-term dynamics sense

 labor markets unsustainably tight. maintain labor markets taut
 now, think time--and fairly soon--we would begin see real wage pressures

 uncertainties these. simulations hopefully
 going help assess outcome might one optimistic
 assumptions. One might look, say, period since middle last year--when

 services sector, rapid expansion among providers Internet software
 services remains key component growth. recently providers services related
 population growth--health care one example--and tourism also added jobs brisk
 
 - 41 -
 
 pace. Strong job growth past twelve months tightened District labor
 markets. District unemployment rate fell 4-1/2 percent January, 0.6 percentage
 point average 1999. However, yet, tight labor markets resulted
 greater wage inflation District. fact, data ECI point slower wage growth
 District 1999 experienced 1998. pattern declining unemployment
 slower wage growth owes part, believe, three factors: First, increases use
 alternative uncounted forms employee compensation stock options hiring
 bonuses, also job reclassification workers receiving pay raises; second, decline wage
 growth high-tech manufacturing associated slower employment growth sector;
 third, rapid movement less-qualified workers existing job classifications lower
 wages.
 Looking forward, factors tempering wage growth 1999 may reversed
 coming year. example, improved demand within District high-tech manufacturing
 begun boost employment growth, making decelerations wage growth sector
 unlikely. Also, data California indicate number potential workers diminishing.
 flow new entrants unemployment slowing, unemployment rates among
 subgroups lower-than-average skill levels falling.
 Turning national economy, data released past month showed
 slackening domestic demand. Real final sales rose 5 percent annual rate
 second half last year forecast much pace growth first part
 year. rate sales growth likely unsustainable especially concern
 given current levels resource utilization. Therefore, forecast assumes significant
 tightening financial conditions next six months. tightening includes
 
 - 42 -
 
 rise corporate mortgage rates, flattening broad stock market valuations, and-underpinning developments--a gradual increase 75 basis points funds rate.
 financial restraints help slow real GDP growth 4 percent year 3-1/4 percent next
 year forecast.
 Still, even slowing real economic activity, inflation projection
 disappointing. past years, core PCE price index risen 1-1/2 percent
 year, somewhat view price stability. Unfortunately, forecast
 anticipates core PCE inflation rise almost 2 percent next year, giving gains
 made toward price stability since mid-1990s. know, many risks
 inflation forecast. particular, uncertain much fast energy prices
 pass prices, much demand increase economies
 abroad, whether stock prices productivity growth surge fall. However,
 despite possible scenarios could constructed, underlying tightness labor

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. judgment little changed
 outlook hence appropriate course monetary policy since last met. Let
 emphasize three features outlook that, judgment, support increase
 federal funds rate target today suggest increases warranted
 course next several months.
 First, growth aggregate demand continues outpace growth aggregate
 supply even allowing recent upward revisions productivity trend. Many apparently
 difficulty story productivity shock could generate increase
 demand outpaces increase supply. link provides possible explanation
 demand growth exceeding supply growth. believe link plausible.
 really matters monetary policy growth demand exceeding growth
 supply time labor markets already tight. Perhaps important point
 
 - 72 -
 
 whether demand grows faster supply following productivity shock depends
 critically monetary policy response productivity shock, point President Jordan
 made effectively earlier. find plausible holding nominal rates constant
 face productivity shock raises real equilibrium interest rate result excess
 demand relative supply. test whether demand growth fact exceeding supply
 growth happens resource utilization rates. unemployment rate declining
 average almost 0.4 percentage point year since end 1995 declined
 least 0.3 percentage point year, confirming demand growth exceeding supply
 growth. Greenbook projects decline 1/2 percentage point end next year
 3.6 percent absence increases federal funds rate.
 Second, core inflation remains well contained, agree Greenbook
 forecast soon begin rise, reflecting secondary effects recent rise oil
 prices, dissipation possible reversal various favorable price shocks restrained
 inflation earlier, effects tight labor markets. Monetary policy tightening today
 would clearly preemptive appropriately so.
 Third, slowing economy trend unlikely contain risk higher inflation.
 much doubt stable inflation compatible 4 percent unemployment rate.
 Slowing economy trend may, therefore, first step. important step,
 may be--indeed, unlikely be--enough. therefore especially determined
 slow economy least trend quickly aggressively reactive increases core
 inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.

 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. data moving around bit,
 always do, seems situation facing Committee today changed
 little since last meeting. case time, know, see

 pressures. Consequently, see little choice stay course following.

 important source disparity seems judgment

 Hence, oil price increases may adding risks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. think need leave

 put point way: Suppose knew ultimate end going terms

 MR. JORDAN. agree recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, would also like

 MR. HOENIG. Right. move moved 125 basis points since last

 clear sure thing. strategy isn’t move interest rates 1/4 point

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, virtually
 reasonable framework think implies current circumstances real interest rates
 go up.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. let
 make quick comment. feelings Ned Gramlich others
 expressed worry little may get bit comfortable incremental
 approach 1/4 point increases. may enough job, may well case-and good chance view--that forceful actions going required
 sooner later. think need keep mind going forward. said earlier
 meeting, long-term rates, least currently, supporting moves short end
 yield curve. Also, think worth pointing back 1994 tightened policy
 rather aggressively contained inflation soft landing without recession. So,
 
 - 90 -
 
 maybe change people's attitudes impact current policies. It’s almost
 though much credibility, sense. [Laughter]
 Also, issue rising productivity growth, agree second
 derivative may positive. understand it, economic implications
 direction even higher real rates; people going extrapolate acceleration
 productivity try bring attendant higher expected future earnings forward. way
 cut increase real rates, might argue even aggressive
 policy.
 case, again, agree basic recommendation. respect
 good friend Tom Hoenig’s comments, would put opposite spin asymmetry.
 think said last time wanted asymmetry plus. Maybe time say want
 asymmetry vengeance! [Laughter] think need make clear
 prepared turn heat quickly need to.
 MR. HOENIG. Al, anticipating comment--that’s all!
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. "Vengeance mine saith Lord!"
 MR. BROADDUS. need read Bible more.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. agree recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation. think good case
 made kind gradualist policy we've following. However, since
 obviously confessions today, say I, too, didn't come conclusion without
 internal debate own.
 
 - 91 -
 
 mentioned last meeting thought important, terms
 decisions made funds rate announcements tilt, make sure
 bond markets continue build appropriate assumptions future interest rate
 increases. fact, think decrease extent expected rise
 short-term interest rates bond markets. didn't read incoming data supporting
 conclusion. Greenbook didn't read data supporting conclusion. suggests
 time may come going surprise bond markets. Now,
 question is: would like that? Would like today performance
 economy sense unblemished inflation starts rise? would
 like midst rising inflation economic growth may already slowed
 somewhat? It's possible could improve performance economy lot
 reinforce credibility monetary policy decided move aggressively.
 Well, 40 percent case; I'm still 60 percent argues
 gradualist policy today. coming meetings Greenbook forecast correct
 see rise core inflation rate, think good reason move larger
 increment.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. support halves recommendation. since
 confessing, confess heart pure! [Laughter]
 MR. GRAMLICH. You're obviously Catholic! [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. also true. think 25 basis point move appropriate
 today. said earlier, 50 basis point move may appropriate later.
 
 - 92 -
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. know happens whose hearts
 pure? strength strength ten!
 MR. FERGUSON. turn collar around way! [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Secretary, would read appropriate language
 25 basis points balance risks toward inflation?
 MR. BERNARD. I'll reading page 14 Bluebook: "The Federal Open
 Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability
 promote sustainable growth output. long-run objectives, Committee
 immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent increasing federal funds
 rate average around 6 percent." balance risks sentence go press
 release reads: "Against background long-run goals prices stability sustainable

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. FOMC back session. Board Governors

 Banks increase discount rate 5½ percent. front draft statement,
 essentially replicates February statement. anybody comment it?
 MR. BOEHNE. think it's accurate statement Committee is, Mr.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Excellent!
 MR. BROADDUS. one question, Mr. Chairman. first sentence
 second paragraph makes statement conditions considerations essentially
 Committee met February. suppose one interprets word “essentially” quite
 broadly, may true. projections latest Greenbook much stronger. see
 change toward greater recent strength greater expected future strength real activity

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. grant point view; you've held
