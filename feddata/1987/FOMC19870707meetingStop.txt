 MR. TRUMAN. That's right.

 MR. CROSS. Well, think recognize volume terms

 nominal terms little improvement, any.
 that, course, finance. Sometimes market
 participants over-interpret figures sometimes respond
 kind knee jerk [reactions].
 So, think bad trade

 Comments?
 
 First, want say found

 purposes, might useful go exercise every
 

 often re-address issue feel comfortable it.
 think useful. don't major questions; study
 pretty much explains lot. couple things struck
 read wanted bring today. One
 noticed, least period looked at, appeared
 upward bias actual borrowings relative predicted.
 3-1/2 year period, think-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Relative intended?
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes--relative intended. wonder
 think Chairman
 good feel might causing that?
 mentioned yesterday plausible explanation certain periods:
 obviously, get low frictional levels borrowing-when you're targeting something like $300 million less--the bias
 going upside there's lot downside
 opportunity. there's positive bias appears occur
 long period. Chart 2 summarizes information, tend
 show targeted borrowing levels fairly low, that's
 lot positive bias occurred. wonder went back
 longer period you'd still see positive bias it's
 related also periods targeted borrowings high.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 I'm not--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. look chart 2 see positive
 bias there. wonder sense there.
 MR. KOHN. think lot bias occurs 1985,
 abstracting recent period, separate subject.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Right.
 
 borrowings averaging fairly
 
 low.
 MR. KOHN. findings low borrowings versus high
 borrowings didn't really affect funds rate relationship
 much. However, borrowings low, tendency come
 little high something unusual occurs--for example,
 computer breakdown bank doesn't receive wire
 little borrowing, particularly happens weekend--it
 give big boost relative low two-week average.
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes, agree. seems
 ought factored expected borrowings extent.
 MR. KOHN. often that. Peter Sternlight comment

 kept writing excess reserves numbers incorporated
 path; but, sense, lagging little behind
 happening. think period particular explanation.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, question remains--and may
 know answer now--but one period chart
 borrowings fairly high, 1984, bias didn't seem
 exist. typical, fact, periods target
 $900 million, $1 billion, $1-1/2 billion?
 MR. KOHN.
 
 don't know; find out.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. would interesting know that.
 two questions. One major issue this: realize there's
 standard error plus minus--I'm talking borrowings relative
 funds rate standard error mentioned 60
 basis points--that creates noise system. so, there's
 certain amount noise accept; that's plus
 minus. There's difference long-term issue
 detect sort shift. think question arises
 [unintelligible] policy shifts, we're making monetary
 policy adjustment whether anything not.
 question is: detect long-run shift borrowing function
 try offset way? Otherwise, really
 accept policy adjustment nonborrowed reserves going
 lower higher.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 equate policy interest rates.
 
 Well, yes, nonborrowed reserves would
 
 affected.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 [Unintelligible.]
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Maybe borrowings wouldn't, nonborrowed
 path would affected extent.
 don't know-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. question arose summer '84,
 instance. got much higher funds rate given level
 borrowings anticipated.
 MR. JOHNSON. question is:
 decide long-run shift function
 there's consensus developed?
 guess it's
 something ought brought FOMC, acknowledge
 there's shift then-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. sure [unintelligible]
 already while, that's-MR. JOHNSON.
 

 
 Sure has.
 
 MR. STERNLIGHT.

 Sometimes, though, don't enough
 
 information decide whether it's noise real-VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 Well, that's usually case.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. That's usually case, yes.
 last
 question seasonal borrowing.
 seems
 there's always bit question whether seasonal
 borrowing included and, so, extent.
 MR. KOHN.
 
 findings seasonal borrowing
 
 interest sensitive--sensitive spread. It's quite
 interest sensitive adjustment borrowing but, think pointed

 So, kind finding, would appear including

 There's seasonal
 
 MR. KOHN. Well, seasonal seasonal borrowing,
 it's large enough come overall--.
 look seasonal borrowing find significant seasonal;

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Even though seasonal total

 MR. KOHN. Yes. effect, we're saying seasonal

 Desk actually different view that. Frequently, see

 MR. JOHNSON. you're saying whether include not,
 it's really important--

 MR. KOHN. Clearly, works direction

 MR. KOHN. Yes, close it. would trough $100

 MR. JOHNSON. don't think taking would

 MR. KOHN. guess, consistent findings, wouldn't
 reduce much.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 think say-But problem is--

 Yes.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. certainly don't think makes much

 Well, that's was--
 
 MR. ANGELL. answer, would seem me, it's

 MR. JOHNSON. Well, maybe apply adjustment

 that's possible; possible, might able correct

 MR. ANGELL. words, you'd like seasonal

 seasonal target, might adjusted seasonally $540

 -11-
 
 7/7/87
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Something like that. don't know it's
 doable; I'm saying it's worth thinking about.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 would tend give you--
 
 MR. HELLER. Otherwise, always counter steering
 adjustment borrowing that's variable gets squeezed.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 It's worth thinking about.
 
 MR. KOHN. Okay. One option would include seasonal
 extended credit. could treat exogenous factor
 affecting "nonborrowed" reserves. would targeting
 adjustment credit. feeling seasonal sufficiently
 responsive interest rates and, think Chairman said,
 behavior somewhere adjustment extended
 credit, we've included adjustment credit. think
 respond interest rate spreads; it's truly seasonal, that's
 sure.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Yes.
 
 know.
 
 MR. ANGELL. think would better leave
 put seasonal factor would take treat
 like extended credit.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Governor Angell put finger
 saying need ask like adjustment credit
 like something want compensate totally, like
 extended credit. think elements both,
 probably closer adjustment credit.
 MR. JOHNSON. I'm saying might want leave
 in, still make adjustments number.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 
 Yes, possibly.
 
 MR. HELLER. question whether enough

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, think answer question

 Growth

 somewhat mixed picture.
 Germany, weak first quarter,

 Unfortunately, Germany shown strength

 Japan, hand, better first quarter things seem

 put place fiscal package announced

 So, real growth 2-1/4 2-1/2 percent

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. surprised forecast
 projection real consumption, consumer spending. It's really
 quite low level 1988.
 seems one hand, you're
 projecting increased industrial production, would thought
 would increased disposable income, yet you're showing
 increase saving rate.
 would thought would
 higher level consumer expenditures. missing
 equation?
 MR. PRELL. Well, modest growth manufacturing
 employment going stronger industrial production
 gains large means. see overall employment growth
 slowing pace last couple years. Layered top
 would moderate growth nominal personal income would
 sizable consumer price increases--not sizable we've seen
 first half year sizable far
 past year two. thus, that's eroding real income, labor
 income, substantial amount.
 So, pointed out, gains
 income expenditures similar magnitude. low
 growth consumption expenditures, particularly nonrecession
 period. consumption expenditures high relative
 economic activity. consumer durables growing
 strongly. There's probably much less pent-up demand consumer
 durables been. think financial situation

 pessimistic side. would expect tax reform taken
 place, clearly difficult model far econometric
 models concerned, would result considerable broadening
 tax base and, therefore, tax revenues would running higher
 projections indicate. would one factor
 would argue would relieve pressure financial
 markets thus would yield lower interest rates overall

 therefore, lower investment. commodity markets still

 inflation rate surge would accompany projections

 concerned, I'm roughly agreement Greenbook. far
 financial implications concerned, I'm pessimistic;
 therefore, unless something drive interest rates up,
 think see probably level prevails now,
 lower.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, forecast
 year basically agreement Greenbook depart
 somewhat [for 1988] real growth inflation side.
 think real GNP going neighborhood 2.8
 percent, number used wire Board's staff.
 That's basically belief personal consumption
 going stronger Greenbook indicates. also think
 investment forecast 1988 little sluggish side
 Board staff's forecast; think it's going little better
 that. Also, don't see quite improvement trade situation
 Greenbook implies translates forecast
 inflation rising somewhat faster Greenbook.
 fact, put GNP deflator 4.3 percent, half
 point higher staff expectations. Unlike Governor Heller,
 understood correctly, think Federal budget deficit
 projection little optimistic side; think it's perhaps
 going higher $167 billion staff

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Corrigan.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. New York Bank's Research
 Department forecast basically bottom line Board
 staff's forecast couple important differences
 assumptions. forecast New York Research
 Department--I distinguish forecast, sometimes
 they're same--they basically change
 exchange rate forecast period levels
 past month so. Vis-a-vis Board staff's forecast really
 constitutes large difference reflects 9
 10 percent [decline forecast] next year also
 happens balance year. So, net difference
 like 13 14 percent right now. Now,
 don't decline dollar get spurious
 feedbacks that. example, nominal terms, current
 account number next year actually better staff's
 number even though real terms opposite might case; it's
 hard tell precisely. getting 13
 14 percent J-curve effects actually end spurious
 result, least near term, better current account
 situation 1988.
 thing true assumption
 build interest rates don't think quite
 sharp, implication, maybe you're talking about, Mike.
 get different mix: pick little terms domestic
 spending little less perhaps real terms net export
 side. washes terms GNP although,
 said, current account--which financial purposes important-is actually better 1988. thing troublesome
 that, notwithstanding fact assumption change
 dollar, price numbers higher, anything, staff
 numbers--not whole heck lot, higher. Indeed,
 seems look price forecasts
 around, certainly overwhelming consensus forecasts, though
 them, situation 1988 deflator
 either bumps passes 4 percent consumer price index
 either bumps passes 5 percent. cases
 consumer price index gets 5-1/2 percent range. Without
 precise, thinking thresholds 4 percent
 5 percent. I'm hard pressed point see what, short
 recession major slowdown economic growth, prevent
 happening. words, given labor market conditions, import
 prices, rest, kind result seems almost
 baked already. extent developments either oil
 prices things work wrong way, much worse. So,
 find troubling that--and I'm referring personal forecast

 4 5 percent thresholds, despite different assumption

 comments brief, Mr. Chairman,
 primarily practical purposes we're right
 We're slightly less optimistic

 remainder year; rather 3 percent, see

 want pick Bob Parry's theme, using

 money-driven model extending debate money
 growing right now. extending present growth rate--which
 purpose assumed 8 10 percent M1--into 1988
 produced would consider unsatisfactory results,
 deflator getting 5-1/2 percent fourth quarter 1988.
 So, coming projections, assumed degree
 restraint 1988 vis-a-vis 1987, guess, Bob, would really
 translate another way looking interest rate
 assumption. net result that, basically, 1987 tend
 high end [Committee member's ranges] 7-1/4

 trade area growing one large degree
 slack. shifting service base trade-sensitive

 productivity high areas. Employment growth

 chance won't increase labor demand dramatically

 Mr. Black.
 MR. BLACK.
 Mr. Chairman, reading discussion

 way us used view ranges several years ago
 way approaching now, seems
 different.
 past, us thought aggregates
 intermediate targets selected ranges felt would
 consistent progress inflation context
 reasonable economic growth. And, course, one advantages
 fairly direct relationship made announcement
 ranges reasonably clear signal public
 Congress intentions were.
 present approach is,
 think, different that. now, think
 Bluebook makes clear, projecting broad path interest

 Thus, would reservations reducing 1987 range

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 Mr. Parry.
 
 get back M2 1988 time.
 
 MR. PARRY. Well, confine remarks 1987 M2.
 think compelling reason reduce range.
 Projections seen, including Board staff's, would
 indicate growth going 4-1/2 5 percent.

 indeed growth likely be, don't change
 range?
 4-1/2 7-1/2 percent makes lot sense me.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, think ought stay

 occur me: seems did, say, want go alternative

 precision; would rather wait make judgment. final

 little reluctant send strong signal--which alternative

 percent.
 MR. KEEHN. Could ask: record reducing
 ranges last years? tended move 1/2

 MR. KOHN. Yes. Committee reduced nearly every
 1984, M1 M2

 ranges reduced one full percentage point, usually
 one half point.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boehne.
