 presid boehn.
 
 mr. boehn.
 would like follow bob forrest's
 question. basic, u.s. strategi turn trade deficit
 around shrink valu dollar get trade
 partner grow faster grow. done fairli well
 dollar, haven't done well growth abroad.
 it's
 appeal strategi, strike somewhat novel
 look histori kind adjust. happen
 often countri deficit end
 recess.
 word, reduc domest demand
 happen abroad also get downward adjust
 currenc. would think longer take us make
 turnaround trade deficit--as get month month
 disappoint trade figur--that would put addit downward
 pressur dollar. might also begin rais expect
 that, well, nice sound try rather novel strategi,
 end, u.s. go go kind wringer,
 countri do. real question is: much novel
 experi realli run light happen
 countri happen histori?

 hard time think countri hasn't turn around kind
 trade deficit without fair amount suppress domest
 demand. question aim [critic]; like
 approach on. strike somewhat novel
 broader stage histori.
 would like see
 right lot compani experi.
 mr. truman. well, truth matter is, presid
 boehn, exampl success.

 1980s. move small deficit larg surplus.
 on featur forecast that, don't recess
 gnp sens built in, rel slow growth domest

 sens, peter sai earlier
 answer question, that's part process--the process
 make room extern adjust environ

 domest demand growth low.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid guffei.
 
 mr. guffei. mr. chairman, coupl question
 mike respect section caught ey forecast.
 mention declin dollar assum
 forecast. rememb, greenbook made refer
 declin much like project last greenbook. further,
 rememb, declin 10 percent annual basi,
 complet first half year. correct,
 declin assum?
 mr. prell. guess wasn't clear. assumpt
 dollar declin forecast period.

 purpos, put straight line path averag 10
 percent, annual rate.
 mr. guffei. second question
 assumpt rise interest rate fourth quarter.

 specif, level interest rate fourth
 quarter assum forecast?
 mr. prell. isn't necessari precis
 cours. put smooth trajectori move feder fund
 rate, exampl, 8 8-1/2 percent rang next spring.
 mr. guffei.
 
 first quarter?
 
 mr. prell. would approach end
 first quarter.
 don't want precis thi.

 flat next month increas later on,
 wouldn't abl distinguish econom effect forecast
 period whole. gradual rise here.
 mr. guffei. last question comment
 inflat pick up--i guess that's 1988, read
 greenbook number correctli, forecast actual
 declin last quarter year, measur fixedweight index deflat itself.
 
 9/22/87
 
 mr. prell. there's differ forecast
 fix-weight index,
 deflat fix-weight gnp measur.
 3-1/4 percent third quarter 3-1/2 percent
 fourth, wherea there's deceler 3-1/4 percent third
 quarter 2-1/2 percent deflat. differ
 peculiar weight shift occur gnp
 deflat; decreas oil import, rel low
 weight deflat, actual tend depress gnp deflat
 rel fix-weight measur. basic, fairli
 steadi second-half inflat, see it; it's lower
 first half, larg part lower food energi price
 inflat.
 mr. guffei. fair sai, mike, inflat
 second half, particularli last quarter mayb even
 first quarter 1988, reason stabl forecast?
 underli sens, fairli
 mr. prell.
 stabl pictur first second half, that's
 game strip awai food energi price, obvious
 affect special nonmacroeconom influenc short run.
 cours, peculiar thing affect sector, well.
 but, basic fairli stabil underli trend,
 increas next year rate price inflat.
 mr. parri. underli inflat must pick quit
 bit, mark acceler labor cost.
 mr. prell. peopl would take indic
 underli rate inflat. ye, do, compens
 sens, underli
 acceler significantli next year.
 trend pick up.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, comment
 feel last
 direct particular part forecast.
 time economi would somewhat stronger
 greenbook project, staff, inde, move
 forecast gener direct. so, littl quarrel
 done. think main drive forc go
 improv net export good servic; plant
 equip expenditur, particularli equip area, also
 guess, would sai
 provid pretti good push.
 realli
 risk might still forecast littl low.
 bother us, guess, feel might right
 sai that, i'm focus inflat rate
 forecast.
 project next year--when goe 4-1/2
 think ought abl better next
 percent.
 4-1/2
 year, ought target someth less that.
 percent inflat rate could easili becom 5 percent; 5 percent
 so, rather think
 realli reason price stabil.
 mai overestim, we're afraid might right
 come result littl strong
 price side.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor seger.

 ms. seger. ye, coupl question
 ti matter discuss yesterdai pre-fomc
 brief. involv whether complet factor
 rise interest rate alreadi seen, plu wholli
 factor increas think yet come.

 particular, hous start, last month 1.6
 million annual rate, know problem high vacanc
 rate multifamili area, least part countri.
 incent built kind hous shift
 greatli tax reform act. singl famili start, least
 peopl sai sensit interest rate chang.
 guess
 hard time believ 1988 start fall
 1-1/2 million.
 hope don't, sort skittish
 thi.
 mr. prell.
 it's pure conjectur point.
 variou
 econometr model would suggest that, relev horizon here,
 probabl deal interest rate elast 1.
 rise mortgag rate around 10-1/2 percent
 someth high 11's, [an increas of] roughli 10 percent.
 roughli 10 percent declin hous start, 1.6 million
 someth around 1.45 million area. sens, it's well
 line histor pattern. thing provid
 comfort-ms. seger.
 multifamili?
 
 true singl famili
 
 mr. prell. well, i'm look aggreg:
 clearli, affect chang interest rate.
 look anoth angl, mortgag rate back level
 saw 1985, consider higher hous start then--in
 1.7 million area. now, we've probabl gone catchup
 period home ownership, number seem fairli reason
 us, look respons we've seen far substanti
 increas mortgag rate.
 hasn't made market fall apart
 entir. mai quit right, stab
 think normal respons.
 ms. seger. mean lag longer?
 mayb haven't even seen full impact spike back
 april mai, quit dramat.
 mr. prell. well, clearli, felt would see
 much respons summer, even elev rate
 forecast beyond earlier. modest
 declin 1.6 million level previou forecast.
 taken mortgag rate more, lower hous
 start further.
 it's difficult sai. note,
 influenc work, mai still adjust
 tax law chang. still problem high vacanc
 rate home rental properti variou part countri.
 again, look hous price, too, evid suggest
 that, least mani market, there's still pretti robust demand
 interest rate. anecdot evid
 suggest us wai mark assess demand
 posit. even survei inform suggest pretti high number
 
 -11-
 
 9/22/87
 
 peopl whose attitud good time bui hous.
 mai surpris, seem pattern.
 ms. seger. question ti
 yesterdai's brief, relat heavi relianc trade
 turnaround produc good 1988. i'm read number right,
 half real gnp growth, fourth quarter 1987 fourth
 quarter 1988, expect come improv net export.
 again, think it's veri, difficult get $54 billion increas
 export on year--name, year--and tack $57
 billion next year. that's lot produc.
 mr. prell. on main comfort find
 number look us like trend real export
 quit strong thu far. base exchang rate project
 assumpt probabl still lag order
 deliveri process, mean improv export
 still fulli evid. think forecast,
 basic, continu pattern alreadi percept.
 respect, think greater concern, given outlook, would
 get improv net export somehow,
 also get greater domest demand growth. put still greater
 pressur resourc peopl would thought
 past. two year now, forecast, consumpt growth
 realli subpar histor. so, sens,
 thing put togeth wai give rather smooth adjust
 pictur.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid boehn.
 
 mr. boehn. don't question.

 get slow interest-sensit sector

 mr. prell. that's character outlook think
 comment around tabl suggest hope

 chairman greenspan.
 
 mr. melzer.
 
 mr. melzer. mike, linkag dollar weak

 exampl, achiev forecast period 10 percent annual

 word, dollar--i wasn't clear what--
 
 mr. melzer. i'm sai box right
 that, practic matter, toler dollar

 so, let's sai
 would affect
 assum dollar stabl.
 forecast?
 mr. truman.
 depend bit, think, els go
 time. much impetu net export
 dollar, least far forecast horizon goe,
 alreadi train. less half increas next year net
 export directli traceabl project dollar declin.
 but, presum, didn't dollar declin,

 wouldn't kind pressur interest rate.
 would less pressur interest-sensit sector
 economi.
 compens term economi's
 oper whole which, turn, would tend feed back
 net export, would less improv net export
 too.
 but, certain sens [unintellig]
 basic wai think thi.
 mr. heller. wait minut. sai interest rate
 wouldn't rise; also come scenario
 continu stabl dollar come rais
 interest rate countri. then, would answer
 differ?
 mr. truman. scenario, mayb instead $50
 billion chang net export would someth like $20-$25
 billion.
 would less 1 percent gnp
 forecast, that's well within error. mike put wai
 overal forecast.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor johnson.
 
 mr. johnson.
 guess sort go
 ask. on question mind: i'm big "aggreg
 person" but, line whole issu aggreg demand,
 strike recent uptick interest rate go
 damp effect aggreg.
 think fine,
 point, ask much aggreg demand plausibl
 scenario.
 think restrain it. come
 fairli implaus veloc growth number get
 aggreg demand outsid rang would present real breakout
 overal aggreg demand.
 seem pretti
 well corner here.
 long run, could coupl bad
 quarter scenario but, given recent move interest
 rate, project broader monetari aggreg?
 mr. kohn. saw bluebook, project
 rise interest rate, larg
 signific, would damp growth m2 come month.
 
 mr. johnson.

 next year, assumpt moder increas

 impli-mr. johnson.
 
 would pick higher interest
 
 rate?
 mr. kohn. well, first all, rate increas
 thing
 interest rate mai quit great.
 seem depress m2 growth realli couldn't
 account year assum won't quit
 activ next year. exampl, ira won't around,
 might boost m2 growth littl; so, assum pickup
 came about, gnp project
 growth next year.
 would impli 2 percent increas veloc. but, rememb,
 we're damp domest demand here; slower domest demand
 gnp, look veloc perspect,
 wouldn't quit big increas. that's larg
 increas-mr. johnson. that's sort i'm get at.
 corner littl, seem me.
 

 
 chairman greenspan. could rais question
 gnp demand number would realli look like recogn
 wai calcul number function fact
 look fix-weight gnp

 deflat versu gnp deflat, tend pick differ

 fix-weight index--which roughli, quit,
 equival move 1982 base 1987, current year--it
 seem though we're get good deal less wai real
 growth. let's take case point: fourth-quarter fourthquart chang year next, respect differ
 gnp deflat fix-weight deflat, .3 .4,
 respect. assum nomin same, would
 reduc real growth. problem that, howev,
 i'm sure whether model gener real first then,
 implic, nomin, vice versa. look
 issu?
 word, interpret that?
 mr. prell. well, it's difficult dissect precis,
 think deal mostli process look
 real first, infer pressur resourc,
 feed back short-run phillip curv relat wage
 price side. that's stylist character.
 1982, oil
 chairman greenspan. let's specif.
 price, overal import price, much higher now.
 therefor, rise oil import import side real gnp

 larger subtract 1982 base 1987 base.
 guess i'm realli ask restructur total system
 sai, 1987, equal 100 instead 1982, would real gnp

 9/22/87
