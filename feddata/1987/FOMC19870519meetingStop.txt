 MS. SEGER. Doesn't fiscal policy countries react

 maybe move fall, seems kind impact-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. think that's correct.
 You're
 talking anything relevant 1987 point without
 sudden massive change mind Germans, don't expect.
 Even law permitted act quite quickly taxes

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they're going

 Right.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. ongoing discussions
 Germans Japanese respect economies

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, don't know mean
 ongoing discussions. certain amount conversation

 ongoing conversations certainly going result

 Bundesbank quite split

 MR. GUFFEY. speak Germany, include
 Europe major players?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Well, could say Germany kind

 outside EMS. expansion pretty good relative
 countries; seems breakneck rate pretty good

 They're worried exchange rate forth. don't know

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, it's buoyant situation,

 Without it,

 MR. MELZER. Sam, reconcile negative
 sentiment dollar wide interest rate
 differentials mentioned?
 saying here?
 MR. CROSS.
 think interest rate differentials
 probably impact, makes costly recommend
 [the dollar].
 People think: dollar going lower next
 week week, we're better wait.
 pretty short focus long make investments

 days.
 dollar going down, it's better wait.
 lot people think it's going
 certainly many think it's going go up.
 So, there's
 much danger losing [by waiting].
 MR. PARRY. doesn't differential indicate
 people think it's going go down?
 MR. CROSS.

 markets done.
 Japanese long-term rates declined quite
 substantially, much money going back
 Japan.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. look monetary policy Japan

 It's either going we're going see

 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 questions?
 
 Without objection.
 
 Mr. Sternlight.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 say that's enough.
 
 Comments
 
 MR. MELZER. Peter, technical sense--and know
 extraordinary things going recent period--if
 spread 125 basis points discount rate
 prevailing federal funds rate, provide enough
 incentive borrow makes difficult hit
 particular borrowings target?
 that, therefore, perhaps
 introduce little volatility open market operations?
 know
 recent period, you've described,
 things going on.
 guess question really runs spread
 ongoing basis.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. hard day-to-day predict
 spread likely be. mixture
 expectational elements still there. high Treasury balance
 receded operational factor; it's entirely gone,
 receded some.
 think fairly substantial anticipation
 something may well happen discount rate--and
 
 5/19/87
 
 unhappy funds 6-1/2 6-3/4 percent even 6-7/8
 percent range--contributes funds rate staying there, even
 though pure theory sense, going back earlier model
 relationships funds rate we'd expect $400 million
 borrowing, would come something considerably lower
 would agree Bluebook
 recently prevailing rates.
 suggests tendency rate drift back to, below, 61/2 percent level. One could even make case something like 61/4 percent funds rate planned borrowings holding $400
 million.
 MR. BLACK. Peter, something said earlier suggested
 get drifting back funds rate would
 expect see dollar weaken right much. fair reading
 said?
 funds rate drifted back that,
 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 think would cause renewed pressure dollar, yes.
 Sam might want comment that, too.
 MR. PARRY. you've said market's reaction
 far, saying market probably assuming
 borrowing target higher is?
 people I've heard comment
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes.
 would thinking $500 $600 million range borrowing,
 though I've heard talk $400 $600 million, I've heard
 one thought $600 million. would put
 $500 $600 million range.
 MR. JOHNSON. think that's probably borrowings
 averaged $700 million?
 But, certainly, period
 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, yes.
 $1.1 billion realized extraordinary unusual;
 period that, nearly $700 million,
 tended think higher-than-intended side well.
 MR. JOHNSON. borrowing actually turns $600
 $700 million, think expect policy there.
 MR. BLACK.

 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Questions?
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 Jim, sense beyond we've
 seen autos, example, domestic producers responding
 higher import prices much trying grab bigger market
 share raising prices?
 I've sensed anecdotal
 wondering sense extent
 evidence that.
 that.
 MR. KICHLINE. know, auto case one
 point to.
 Beyond don't anything explicit.
 look
 producer price index April, fact, little
 happening taking away energy food cars.
 Basically,
 we're talking prices seem moving
 rate.
 It's something we've looking for. run across
 comments producers looking every opportunity increase
 margins but, point, don't really hard
 evidence hand.
 MR. BOEHNE.

 alone.
 MR. PARRY. Jim, forecast consumption quite weak,
 particularly nondurable services components
 comment question. regard services, I'm sure
 know, there's strong secular component growth services.
 growth rate probably kind growth rate
 one sees recession periods. me, that's bit surprising.

 think understand occurring terms forecast.

 guess decline value dollar causes PCE deflator
 go up, hits real income slows growth
 consumption. I'm sure see this: doesn't
 increase PCE deflator affect prices heavily?
 don't
 think see inflation rate.
 don't deflators,
 I'm trying to-MR. KICHLINE. look GNP deflator GNP
 fixed-weighted index persistent effect net exports
 subtracted, tends depress GNP measures.

 look private domestic final purchases prices, PCE fixed-weight
 measure deflator picks directly import prices
 we're talking rising double-digit rates.
 you're
 right: prices personal consumption expenditures rising
 even excess 4 percent--4-1/4 nearly 5 percent 1988.
 effect forecast depressing real income growth.
 right sense believe facing
 fairly weak picture domestic consumption. view part
 adjustment process rising import prices depressing
 [consumption].
 
 5/19/87
 
 MR. PARRY. Would say, looking risks
 consumption area, might high side? Well,
 durables.
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, given everything, I'd say
 consumption numbers outside durables really low growth
 rates. One might expect find rates happening recession
 environment. sense consumption might higher.
 hand, we're starting inflation picking
 depressing effects real income growth characteristics
 think would act damp demand. You're quite correct;
 low rates consumption.
 MR. STERN. Jim, regard domestic auto sales,
 especially next couple quarters, assuming anything
 particular incentive programs anything accounts
 strengthening here?
 MR. KICHLINE. Explicitly, we've assumed order
 reduce stocks hand, running something like 75
 days' supply, maintain incentives one fashion
 another. get third quarter, assumed
 cutback domestic auto production probably somewhat limited
 sales incentive programs continue sell cars. So, think
 it's combination incentives well cuts
 production.
 MR. MELZER. Jim, assessment inventory
 situation autos?
 MR. KICHLINE. Autos area sense
 there's problem lurking. data lag, times they're hard
 interpret. manufacturing sector, certainly, long period
 time manufacturers running low inventories.
 fact, forecast inventory/sales ratios flat drifting
 down. haven't spotted sectors unusual things
 going outside autos.
 MS. SEGER. Jim, really think producers
 durable equipment snap back one quarter weakness?
 Isn't tax reform impact going to, unfortunately, last longer?
 MR. KICHLINE. is, part, arithmetic. January
 plunged plunged partly included business
 investment would auto light truck purchases. part
 arithmetic February March came back, orders sort
 flattened out. know auto sales rising bit,
 second quarter, instead 13 percent drop recorded first
 quarter, pickup real terms something like 6-1/4
 percent. part that's arithmetic; part that's pickup auto
 sales. think one ought read that; read
 essentially unchanged business spending
 year real terms.
 think that's accurate picture.
 MS. SEGER.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. PARRY. Compensation per manhour, I'm sure
 key element inflation forecast, seems change dramatically
 
 5/19/87
 
 1988.
 change abruptly?
 I'm questioning
 it's going rise.
 seems going one level,
 step function, stays [higher] level.
 MR. KICHLINE. number things going on.

 begin with, January 1988 sizable increase Social
 Security taxes and, along that, assumed rise
 wage base. We've assumed compensation kick 4/10ths
 1 percent beginning QI '88 large Social Security tax
 increase--the employer share. features assume
 we're going begin forceful effect higher prices
 feeding back wage behavior 1988.
 forecast, may

 noticed, lower path unemployment rate.
 think
 caught surprise numbers come out.
 might little problem there. Essentially, forecast, we're
 going looking unemployment rate 6-1/4 percent later
 1988. knows natural rate is, think we're
 probably range somewhere pretty close that.
 we're
 going damping effect wage growth previously.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 I'd like make comment business
 conditions generally. District, think economy
 performed better far year people expected.
 Unemployment region, example, 5 percent.
 States
 like New Jersey Delaware 3 percent range even areas
 Strength continues
 Pennsylvania fairly well.
 construction, residential nonresidential; retailers
 generally upbeat; loan growth categories continues
 national average.
 manufacturing, would say erosion
 jobs manufacturing areas tended cease
 modest comeback. So, think manufacturing [sentiment]
 shifted negative attitude one that's somewhat positive,
 although must say couple hundred manufacturers last
 week still like protectionism don't like higher
 interest rates, snugging up, whatever call it.
 Turning national scene, seems
 forecasts generally target, anything, economy turning
 touch better.
 trade area, least feel better-not much we're exceeding expectations
 evidence supporting forecast turnaround, dramatic,
 seems there. positive evidence exports
 improving expect strength area.
 However,
 think real news national scene what's happening
 inflation.
 It's much indicators inflation
 going up; think expected terms energy import
 prices.
 concern--and see financial markets,
 also hear talking business people generally--is
 heightened concern future course inflation. think
 really comes doubt whether keep
 adjustments one-time adjustments whether we're set
 new upward trend inflation. think real change
 last six weeks two months--that concern inflation
 significantly higher last time met.
 
 5/19/87
 
 MR. JOHNSON. going around table now?

 starts year far significantly higher
 national average. consequence, demand building products
 strong. example, they've produced gypsum first
 quarter absolutely record level.
 agricultural side, I'd confirm Bob Boykin
 said.
 seems us land values really beginning
 stabilize.
 first-quarter survey indicated stability
 first time long time, though one quarter doesn't
 trend make, nonetheless certainly improvement. course,
 commodity prices--the increases corn soybeans
 recently--have significant help relating land values.
 gone tractor implement manufacturers
 situation continues very, tough. Dealer
 inventories low. There's lot floor traffic, I'm told,
 farmers reducing debt; certainly
 sales.
 good thing they're reducing debt fast
 can. And, therefore, they're position take new
 obligations equipment. it's possible agricultural
 situation stabilizing, admittedly low level, won't
 continue decline.
 must say find inflation issue very,
 perplexing. Absolutely everybody talking worrying
 it, think little self-fulfilling.
 [It's in] numbers look at, commented. Outside
 food energy sectors, find people
 talking price increases seem line.

 wholesale series price increases 2 3 percent category;
 seem norm. guess difference time
 last year, really recently, talking price
 decreases; we're talking price increases 2 3 percent.
 think there's important shift psychology goes
 along change going decreases increases.
 Certainly, long-term rates telling us something. They're either
 saying we're going get very, strong economic growth
 rate inflation going pick up.
 And, related Bob Black's
 comment, think perhaps appropriate take
 steps try reassure markets regard commitment
 price stability.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Ms. Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. continue concerned sluggishness

 Even March figures showed weakness beyond autos. discussed
 Jim Kichline wondering enough weakness

 judgment, haven't yet seen impact recent runup
 interest rates indicators since much took
 place April far May. So, concerned
 forecast may bit high there.
 interested autos--and comments
 around table others may too--I share couple
 observations got
 basically
 disappointed auto sales figures April and, particularly,
 early May. General Motors, using incentives selectively;
 generally, combination rebates consumers,
 special deals interest rates, also rebates
 giving directly dealers themselves. example, Cadillac
 pay $1000 $2000 per car every one dealer
 moves certain slow-moving models. That's tremendous. Also,
 imports first time selling well. Japanese
 selling quota, even incentives
 lost money January February; that's
 offering,
 terribly good sign. Inventories, course, extremely
 heavy. comment asphalt put cars
 going corn fields wheat fields. Also,
 pointed statistics reported
 far year may, fact, overstate strength true retail
 demand fleet sales concentrated first couple
 months year running 25 30 percent
 deliveries far. Fleet sales go dealers and, therefore,
 picked numbers follow.
 
 again,
 couple comments
 disappointed pace auto sales, particularly April
 early May. point trucks also showing
 weakness. think forty thousand units removed
 production schedules next three months
 continued oversupply new cars. don't attitude

 dealing retailers

 using negative real GNP growth figure quarter,

 million units 1987 versus 11.4 million last year.

 certainly would agree forces working direction

 even predictable, seems one two things,
 both, may operative: first, amounts increases
 may larger people thought going be;
 second--I means saying that--that isn't thing
 one-time price increases.
 think tendency

 So, whether it's terms forecasts--and
 Wall Street forecasts, forecasts number sources around

 Mr.

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would support Bluebook
 alternative C.
 seems prospect high inflation
 main reason support tightening stated policy
 present time. mentioned before, view
 economy certainly close full employment terms labor
 resources, expect economy expand year rate
 slightly faster current long-run potential growth
 rate.
 seems consideration particularly
 important declining dollar recent increases
 oil prices, causing cause inflation rates go
 even without demand pressures.
 think danger
 increases inflation year next could become imbedded
 inflation expectations. And, given think apparent
 strength economy, risk cutting economic expansion short
 tightening policy seems small.
 would
 preference, too, accomplished something
 want brought up.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. saying alternative C;
 looking literally say either increase [the borrowing
 built into] reserve path increase discount rate.
 MR. PARRY. Yes.
 would prefer increase discount

 going say sooner would better later

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Yes.
 
 Mr. Boykin.

 MR. BOYKIN.
 would agree Bob Parry said
 really can't add much it.
 Alternative C look like
 best alternative me. lot reference made inflation
 probably real; expectation
 seems really need move
 expectation. probably hard wring last

 So, would go alternative C. Likewise, would
 probably favor increase borrowing assumption $400

 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm sure understand question.
