 [statement--see appendix.]
 

 mr. parri. two question forecast.
 take anoth look forecast third quarter-incorpor recent data regard employ, retail
 sale, product--do think number you'd come
 would higher?
 possibl weakest quarter
 year, fact, could turn second quarter?
 mr. prell. well, won't know sure second
 quarter look like even next week's number. point,
 incom expenditur flow number don't point clearli upward
 downward revis. third quarter, suppos
 recalcul todai, best guess number would
 fraction higher; would sai would necessarili differ
 significantli second quarter.
 but, basi
 retail sale data, could see number would closer 3
 percent.
 mr. parri. second question involv inflat.
 sharp drop-off, last month, second half's
 inflat rate term gnp fix-weight deflat.
 seem
 littl surpris me, particularli given revis gnp data
 saw last month also somewhat brighter glow

 i'm sure understand what's caus
 that.
 mr. prell. well, dissect forecast,

 mr. boehn.
 i'd like explor coupl area.
 made
 point 6 percent unemploy, less, get

 seem look across countri,
 even within region, variabl unemploy rate
 averag awfulli mislead. take district,
 exampl. number area unemploy rate
 around 3 percent.
 also area unemploy
 rate 8 percent.
 would guess across countri,
 would find unemploy rang 3 percent to, mayb, 10 12
 percent. doesn't lot depend addit growth come
 from?
 exampl, we're go see growth come
 manufactur. 6 percent mean would think would
 mean, averag?
 seem kind analysi which,
 appeal, greatli oversimplifi, given

 mr. prell. well, try highlight

 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor seger.
 
 ms. seger. guess want plai "what if" game
 me. respect oil price--i'm expert foreign
 affair kind affair--but disrupt persian
 gulf, think, definit impact oil price,
 mention earlier. sweep mine awai
 tension reliev. then, see oil price come
 down, let's sai, $15 $16 per barrel--that's estim,
 assum would happen--what would kind chang
 on factor overal forecast?
 seem me,
 read materi number time, high oil
 price, rise oil price, drive mani concern
 forecast rest year next year.
 mai turn briefli mr. morri' question,
 mr. prell.
 on thing we've mind sort cautionari note
 order figur on, can't tell much
 might potenti export; so, point number need
 read cautious. view oil situat, tri
 suggest, could see downsid risk. evid,
 get anoth on
 consider move stockpil oil.
 swing there's movement toward destock,
 opec swing produc don't cut back promptli enough, could see
 least temporari drop crude oil price, mayb even lower
 level you've suggest. but, basic, think
 perceiv, sinc end last year, reason enough coher
 opec countri contain product within level
 enabl sustain price target level.
 tend
 think crunch like rel short-live
 would, perhap, introduc [unintellig] price final
 product, petroleum product. would quit surpris see
 someth perman enough produc significantli lower
 trend energi price forecast horizon.
 mr. truman. governor seger, rais oil price
 assumpt next year; fact, it's on
 februari. so, sens, drawback order
 forecast correct.
 obvious, risk:
 talk risk opec agreement made
 late last year would fall apart that-ms. seger.
 think there's honor among thiev.

 price rise, think peopl go
 tempt cheat, continu cheat.
 thei're cheat
 thei're exceed quota--on set
 among themselv.
 guess i'm prepar think thei'll get
 religion real quickli.
 mr. truman. well, that's on reason you're
 damn do, damn don't; it's on reason
 
 8/18/87
 
 essenti stuck assumpt close

 forecast period, certainli cheat among--.
 real issu behavior kei produc
 gulf region--[whether] saudi arabia, produc
 oil, cut back suffici sustain price someth like
 $18 barrel. on factor [unintellig] product
 period necessari take driven
 stockpil.
 chairman greenspan. think saudi selfcorrect mechan maintain post $18
 barrel light arabian crude price, spot price goe it,
 lift fall, on go pai $18
 so, it's sort self-correct mechan,
 spot $17-1/2.
 think that's on
 work begin thi.
 reason cheat realli issu relev bring

 mr. prell. mr. chairman, cours, [unintellig].

 that's forecast.
 
 mr. prell. term rule-of-thumb, $5 barrel

 domest output price.
 ms. seger. wouldn't also help trade balanc?
 again, seem higher price oil

 mr. stern. alreadi touch thi,
 done analysi impact higher energi price

 mr. prell. well, i'm sure kind analysi

 it's clear, though, first-half
 acceler consum price larg energi price; food
