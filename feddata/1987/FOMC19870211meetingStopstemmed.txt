 discuss long-run rang.
 mr. kohn.
 appendix.]
 
 thank you, mr. chairman.
 
 [statement--see
 
 chairman volcker. think probabl ought turn m2
 m3 first see whether resolv those. on
 understand correctli,
 question, isol it, m1.
 you're sai it's matter judgment but, it's worth,
 you're reluct sai growth would less 10 percent
 m1; howev, model show half that.
 mr. kohn. model show rate order 5
 7-1/2 percent m1 1987.
 chairman volcker.
 
 don't believ model.
 
 mr. kohn. that's correct.
 model show rate
 other closer mark
 littl 1986.
 impli mark slowdown, especi ocd compon,
 troubl believ them.
 mr. johnson. put set interest rate
 assumpt make it-mr. kohn. no, model result base interest
 rate assumpt behind greenbook forecast--that is, essenti
 littl chang.
 chairman volcker. ye, growth greatli exceed
 actual declin
 said last year.
 interest rate took place last year?
 mr. kohn. even actual declin interest rate,

 sever model underpredict monei growth last year.
 quarterli model didn't badli; 2 2-3/4
 percentag point--that 12-3/4 percent.
 chairman volcker.
 
 model show next year?
 
 mr. kohn. model show 5 6 percent, depend
 assumpt offer rate and-chairman volcker. return m1, it's
 product look m2 m3 first last time.
 anybodi want sai someth m2 m3?
 vice chairman corrigan.
 
 altern ii m2
 
 m3.

 mr. johnson. altern ii right me, too.
 think it's import give signal we're move toward
 littl restraint broader aggreg; least,
 consist continu try keep inflat suppress.
 
 2/10-11/87
 
 -29-
 
 think enough room target allow
 fairli signific wai. given m2 last year,
 explos m1 declin interest rate, doesn't seem
 it's sensit. so, think altern ii would abl
 handl event.
 chairman volcker.
 
 governor angel.
 
 mr. angel. prefer altern ii also. would seem
 accommod 1986 apt occur; 8-1/2
 percent, even declin veloc scenario, give us
 equal opportun snug bit. think, proce
 altern ii, year awar fact
 market forc even import. is, long-term
 bond rate intermedi bond rate rise, seem
 that, given problem dollar, ought particularli
 sensit interest rate--on side also. want
 altern ii proviso interest rate ought
 manag fed much differ market forc would
 indic.
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. boehn.
 
 mr. boehn. like altern ii, get ask
 question: kind messag ought send?
 monetari polici larg on-wai street toward eas
 last two three year, particularli last year. think it's
 time send messag monetari polici oper two-wai
 street: circumst might loosen
 also circumst might tighten more.
 think altern ii send two-wai street messag.
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. forrest.
 
 mr. forrest. mr. chairman, don't realli see great deal
 differ among variou altern but, psycholog
 reason, would prefer altern ii.
 think import
 send signal public market
 continu observ inflat. particularli import
 year next year estim increas inflat
 accur, think ar. so, would prefer altern ii.
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. parri.
 
 mr. parri. mr. chairman, would favor altern ii
 well. would make suggest far send messag
 commit price stabil. work we've done
 indic it's quit like m2 grow lower end
 rang and, read bluebook, got feel
 quantit work board staff done would suggest
 well. seem on thing could 5-1/2
 8-1/2 percent m3 5 8 percent m2. chang, far
 m2 concern, would repres full percentag point declin
 1986. think would send messag.
 chairman volcker. would you?
 5-1/2 percent would what?
 
 wai thi?
 
 -30-
 
 2/10-11/87
 
 mr. parri.
 
 m2 5 8 percent--
 
 chairman volcker.
 
 m2 5 8.
 
 mr. parri. m3 5-1/2 8-1/2 percent.
 work we've done would support and--mayb comment
 thi--i think quantit work board staff done
 suggest m2 would grow low end rang.
 chairman volcker. let pin down. read
 opposit someplac--mayb it--that m3 would grow less m2.
 mr. parri.
 
 no, no.
 
 mr. kohn. actual, judgment given
 expect bank thrift credit growth, tend drive m3
 manag liabil compon; expect
 deceler substanti. m3 7 percent tick below,
 6-1/2 7 percent. m2 7 percent judgment. mr.
 parri absolut right sens quarterli model,
 tri indic brief, show someth order
 6 6-1/2 percent m2 growth, lower end
 rang. think model show like 5 5-1/2 percent.
 chairman volcker.
 governor heller.
 
 model judgment.
 
 mr. heller. well, i'm favor altern ii
 you've got bit confus. first all, let remark
 short-run altern. realiz mai want discuss later,
 target first three month rather high. it's

 high end rang m2 lower end rang m3.
 think that's chairman volcker talk about. san
 francisco also got confus. favor discount rate
 cut yet want tighter monetari target?
 mr. parri.
 mr. heller.
 
 don't vote discount rate.
 i'll stick altern ii.
 
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. keehn.
 
 mr. keehn. would definit favor altern i.
 choic, view, "ii" "iii". establish
 pattern last year reduc rang yearli
 basi altern would certainli break that.
 altern ii iii, see particular reason choos
 altern ii, adopt [on tent basi] last summer.
 certainli, seem expect hit
 altern iii might suggest chang polici don't realli
 intend particular point. so, i'd end altern ii.
 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, i'd reluct reduc
 rang full percentag point altern iii suggest,
 think we'd risk confus market went altern i.

 mr. morri.
 
 mr. morri. vote altern ii well. on thing
 ought keep mind elimin ira account
 like drive m2 rel incom. that's i'd concern
 move m2 target 8 percent. mai need littl
 room that. bluebook sai don't expect much effect

 still think honest present would

 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. stern.
 
 mr. stern. favor altern ii well. it's
 worth, model suggest m2 growth would probabl turn
 near 8 percent year ahead. model also
 somewhat stronger pictur economi greenbook forecast;
 plug someth akin greenbook forecast
 think you'd get someth comfort within altern ii rang

 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. guffei.
 
 mr. guffei.
 would also favor altern ii.
 don't
 great deal faith m2 m3 guid polici.
 look

 mani thing happen--polici chang, interest rate
 drop--and still growth come 8 9 percent.

 chairman volcker.
 add cleveland?
 
 mr. hendrick, someth
 
 mr. hendrick. also believ would appropri
 adopt rang 1987 set juli, would
 favor altern ii.
 chairman volcker. well, seem great unanim.
 i,
 person, could make case altern iii.
 thought
 bluebook set rather convincingli won't make case.
 altern ii obvious easi thing do; it's nice
 compromis.
 interpret mean, without rigid
 it, expect growth someplac middl rang;
 time it's target set reason symmetr around
 growth be.
 let us turn m1 caveat--that want
 someth like variant [in bluebook], think
 inform content, i'm crazi particular languag

 think need littl work, i'm littl reluct
 rewrit detail right rather break.

 chairman volcker.
 
 well, all--
 
 vice chairman corrigan. look term
 variant variant ii, predict, come somewher

 someth like first sentenc variant i.
 chairman volcker.
 bracket someth?
 
 would part first
 
 vice chairman corrigan. no, first sentenc.
 put someth like thi: "look 1987, context

 that's variant i?
 mr. morri.
 
 gener, like kind languag
 
 ye.
 
 chairman volcker. let make case
