 Thank you.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 

 MR. PARRY. two questions forecast.
 take another look forecast third quarter-incorporating recent data regard employment, retail
 sales, production--do think number you'd come
 would higher?
 possible weakest quarter
 year, fact, could turn second quarter?
 MR. PRELL. Well, won't know sure second
 quarter looked like even next week's numbers. point,
 incoming expenditure flow numbers don't point clearly upward
 downward revision. third quarter, suppose
 recalculate today, best guess number would
 fractionally higher; would say would necessarily differ
 significantly second quarter.
 But, basis
 retail sales data, could see number would closer 3
 percent.
 MR. PARRY. second question involves inflation.
 sharp drop-off, last month, second half's
 inflation rate terms GNP fixed-weight deflator.
 seems
 little surprising me, particularly given revisions GNP data
 saw last month also somewhat brighter glow
 economic statistics.
 I'm sure understand what's causing
 that.
 MR. PRELL. Well, dissect forecast,
 deceleration primarily consumption area and, part,
 reflects better food prices, noted. And, unless something goes
 seriously awry, increase energy prices second half
 distinctly slower first half. may get little
 
 8/18/87

 expecting considerable slowing. Also, moderately
 encouraged trend non-energy services area consumer

 months, carried little longer

 MR. PARRY. doubling growth

 MR. PRELL. course, part surge consumption

 MR. BOEHNE.
 I'd like explore couple areas.
 made
 point 6 percent unemployment, less, getting
 kind full employment zone start get inflation
 pressures.
 seems look across country,
 even within regions, variability unemployment rates
 average awfully misleading. Take District,
 example. number areas unemployment rate
 around 3 percent.
 also areas unemployment
 rate 8 percent.
 would guess across country,
 would find unemployment ranges 3 percent to, maybe, 10 12
 percent. Doesn't lot depend additional growth comes
 from?
 example, we're going see growth coming
 manufacturing. 6 percent mean would think would
 mean, average?
 seems kind analysis which,
 appeal, greatly oversimplified, given
 variability.
 one area might talk about.
 MR. PRELL. Well, try highlight
 geographic disparities chart show [presentation
 Committee] last month, showed that, regionally,
 unemployment rates substantially different seeing
 different wage trends.
 Clearly, Northeast area
 average unemployment rate distinctly lower,
 seeing wage deceleration, judging employment cost
 index, example, past couple years.
 Historically,
 obviously, economy never perfectly level. try
 compress one statistic, always disparities
 unemployment rate levels. present time, disparity might
 little greater typically been. But, get
 question pressure points going be,
 hard say. Clearly, slack prime heavy

 example, industries Northeast probably
 benefitting increased competitiveness. approach question
 degree humility. can't state precisely natural
 rate unemployment is; assign fairly broad band,
 recognize question bottlenecks fortuitous precise
 matching increase demand areas
 slack could create variation spots.
 Basically, though,
 
 8/18/87

 MR. PRELL. think identify areas

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. guess want play "what if" game
 me. respect oil prices--I'm expert foreign
 affairs kind affairs--but disruption Persian
 Gulf, think, definitely impact oil prices,
 mentioned earlier. sweep mines away
 tensions relieved. Then, see oil prices coming
 down, let's say, $15 $16 per barrel--that's estimate,
 assume would happen--what would kind change
 one factor overall forecast?
 seemed me,
 read material number times, high oil
 prices, rising oil prices, driving many concerns
 forecast rest year next year.
 may turn briefly Mr. Morris' question,
 MR. PRELL.
 one thing we've minds sort cautionary note
 orders figures on, can't tell much
 might potential exports; so, point numbers need
 read cautiously. view oil situation, tried
 suggest, could see downside risk. Evidently,
 get another one
 considerable move stockpile oil.
 swings there's movement toward destocking,
 OPEC swing producers don't cut back promptly enough, could see
 least temporary drop crude oil prices, maybe even lower
 level you've suggested. But, basically, think
 perceived, since end last year, reasonable enough coherence
 OPEC countries containing production within levels
 enable sustain prices target level.
 tend
 think crunch likely relatively short-lived
 would, perhaps, introduce [unintelligible] prices final
 products, petroleum products. would quite surprised see
 something permanent enough produce significantly lower
 trend energy prices forecast horizon.
 MR. TRUMAN. Governor Seger, raised oil price
 assumption next year; fact, it's one
 February. So, sense, drawback order
 forecast correct.
 Obviously, risks:
 talking risk OPEC agreement made
 late last year would fall apart that-MS. SEGER.
 think there's honor among thieves.

 tempted cheat, continue cheat.
 They're cheating
 they're exceeding quotas--ones set
 among themselves.
 guess I'm prepared think they'll get
 religion real quickly.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, that's one reasons you're
 damned do, damned don't; it's one reasons

 MR. PRELL. Well, I'm sure kind analysis

 It's clear, though, first-half

 MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. forecast
 changed very, little since last FOMC meeting. still
 growth '87 turning 2-1/2 3 percent range;
 change forecast, think may
 well get closer 3 percent level 2-1/2; so,

 forecast really growth tad 3 percent.
 differences Greenbook, they're minor.
 '88,
 think may well get somewhat higher growth. I'm also
 optimistic deficit picture; gut reaction that,
 given election year, on, may difficult achieve
 meaningful improvement there. Last month mentioned
 sizable difference opinion staff personal

 everybody reads conditions financial institutions.
 One concern hearing, primarily people mid-sized
 small businesses, they're concerned they're
 going get credit. without credit, they're going able
 grow expand create jobs. something we're
 hearing more. banks willing able lend,
 cutoff credit occurred; don't see much end
 it.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. banks thrifts
 getting super conservative? idea?
 MR. BOYKIN. That's lot it, Jerry. bankers say
 loan demand. small mid-sized
 businessmen say demand banks won't take risk. So,
 think it's probably somewhere between--the banks seeing
 kind demand loans willing make.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. agree general Greenbook says
 I've heard outlook. think it's picking up;
 looks better growing upside risk. However,
 number concerns really cause question view
 completely, problems
 Greenbook forecast, particular. So, I'm still uncertain, overall.
 First, growth see appears primarily due
 improvement real net exports; export volume causing stimulus
 see right now. And, indeed case--if
 growth coming external area rather domestic
 aggregate demand--you really ask much
 potential Phillips-curve type effects pricing get
 kind growth. modest expansion aggregate demand,
 think, verified somewhat aggregates, well
 types evidence consumption. really ask
 much inflation pressure produced type scenario.
 look broader inflation indexes, CPI, excluding
 energy, shows pressure, PPI shows influence outside
 energy area. matter fact, decelerating
 year, ex-oil. really don't see broad buildup yet
 price side.

 staff forecast rising interest rates, think

 rise interest rates, least aggregate models
 correct, going produce weakening monetary
 aggregates. Looking weakening monetary
 much nominal GNP
 aggregates, ask yourself:
 get kinds aggregate growth rates,
 velocity number consistent make sense
 you?
 don't think get much rising interest rates
 scenario aggregates produce enough nominal GNP
 produce serious risk.
 point movement dollar.
 One
 problem dollar pointed yesterday
 Board meeting: really net depreciation dollar
 year. Now, there's always possibility, continue
 worry downside risks dollar.
 know come
 little today; we've talked reasons. fact
 matter net dollar depreciation
 year we're late year. forecast contingent upon
 10 percent depreciation '87 produce lagged effects prices
 '88. course, still four months opportunity
 that.
 ask yourself, you're going realize
 kind dollar depreciation year, going get
 lagged effects '88?
 point oil
 price expected hover $18 range--and it's feeling
 dollar influenced oil price--an oil price
 range keep dollar high relative currencies
 major industrial surplus countries like mark yen.

 dollar stays stronger oil price hovers $18
 range, going get dollar depreciation?

 questions, I'm saying can't overcome,
 see outlook picking some, too. really haven't resolved
 questions mind think serious alternative
 issues deal with. So, given problems, don't think
 enough evidence expect big upward move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. many ways, Manley, you've made speech,
 think hear saying
 uncertainty comments might indicate.
 seem
 it's appropriate us assume inflationary pressures
 need dealt with, it's appropriate us
 monetary aggregate growth path having. me,
 4 percent M1, M2, M3 path is, itself, rather significant
 antidote inflationary pressures exist.
 Even though
 inflationary pressures there, far
 turned corner abating price increases, might
 possibility successful willing
 maintain monetary aggregates growth path have.
 there's something notice get country
 talk farmers people oil business realtors:
 sense unease that's country really goes
 suggesting, Si, regard farm income.
 true
 1986 record year net cash farm income; 1987 going
 another record record.
 notice
 conservatism, even super conservatism, exists.

 8/18/87
 
 people survivors, businesses
 successful, ones kept borrowing down. notice
 rush borrow; notice stories entrepreneur types
 makes sense borrow money that. notice
 instead fast-food business quite was,
 owning houses doesn't seem quite way profit.
 notice unease scare moderates behavior.
 So, might growth path monetary
 aggregates could bring stop commodity price rises we've
 seen last year, beginning last August.
 commodity price rises abate inflation expectation goes
 away, possibility deflationary forces could
 return. think need point open:
 look various possibilities see trick
 getting commodity price rises stopped sufficient time
 feed back wage/price cycle.
 accomplished, seems 4.1 percent GNP deflator
 4.5 percent increase fixed-weight index 1988 totally
 unacceptable. must let occur. said that,
 let's get ready overkill.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. Well, considerably comfortable
 Greenbook forecast meeting July,
 seems thrust latest statistics economy,
 revisions, serves bolster underpinnings
 credibility forecast, least mind. think
 revisions important, well, story think
 help put things consistent picture. Throughout
 expansion, seems me, we've consistently strong increases
 employment seeing weaker increases would
 expected GNP forth; least mind,
 gap reduced. think looking economy
 really performing rather well.
 That's certainly consistent what's going Ninth
 District. talked two-tier economy
 divergence what's happening urban areas,
 well, rural areas. latest developments suggest
 gap diminished; is, rural economies
 better, part agriculture better, part
 aspects natural resource industries
 rural area Ninth District depends better.
 that's encouraging. might also comment fact I've
 received number unsolicited reports businessmen
 District increased interest export opportunities--that is,
 potential foreign customers coming explore
 possibilities sales abroad various products. everything
 high-tech end world basic commodities.
 Again, think that's consistent seen happening
 economy recently forecasts suggest.
 think that, good news, probably
 approaching critical point comes inflationary pressures.
 Mike indicated, think attribute much acceleration
 broad price indexes far year effects higher
 
 8/18/87
 
 -18-
 
 energy prices.
 think looking forward, number
 things horizon give pause even energy prices
 level maybe even come bit here. One clearly
 we're seeing bond market elsewhere around
 world, signs heightened inflationary
 expectations manifest long-term rates.
 Secondly,
 guess I'm confident fiscal 1988 we'll achieve
 Federal budget deficit significantly year's level.

 fact, could could higher, we're bit lucky. And,
 finally, far labor market goes, don't know
 natural rate unemployment is, whatever is, certainly
 lot closer today recently.
 surprisingly, look unemployment various demographic
 groups, would expect, lowest rates
 unemployment general since 1980 and, cases, since 1977.
 groups go back 1977, least using quarterly
 average data, find unemployment rates low. think
 benefitted heretofore rigidities wage determination
 process familiar; I'm talking
 goes unions, way business run.
 don't think count rigidities wage
 determination process always working favor, particularly
 price indexes start move here.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice President Hendricks.
 
 MR. HENDRICKS.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. views
 economic conditions closely parallel staff's forecast
 Greenbook. others suggested, couple areas
 differ bit. One growth income,
 consumption. balance, appears us economy
 picking strength. Employment, output, exports expanding,
 see it, noticed jump prices.
 Comments
 directors others support view. Even hardest hit sectors
 --commercial construction, agriculture, metals--are said,
 particularly directors, enjoying period stability
 possible turnaround. it's surprising, guess,
 would suggest forecast shows strength, balance,
 indicated Greenbook.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. hope staff forecast right
 target, questions doubts, guess.
 One
 expressed yesterday staff briefing [to Board]
 involves emphasis trade turnaround.
 I'm convinced
 get much boost overall economic picture
 trade turnaround counting forecast either
 rest year 1988.
 mentioned earlier
 trading partners economic situations far
 short robust.
 think that's key factor. Also, one
 mentioned it, trade barriers business
 people tell about. obvious ones involve trying
 get Japanese market.
 Also, I'm convinced dollar
 going fall much we're assuming forecast.
 realize
 banged but, Governor Johnson said, things
 going may prevent happening. Also, staff
 talking gradual upward drift interest rates. may
 
 8/18/87
 
 -19-
 
 happen, depending, course, policy stance take.
 guess don't see much bite economy upward
 drift might expected. Looking autos--and would
 near-term situation '88--I think it's going
 lot tougher reduce inventories apparently think,
 Mike.
 specific makes 100-day supply; that's
 worked easily even 1.9 percent interest rates.
 One
 reasons many haven't lot sex appeal
 models; may give away Saturday night,
 don't know. Anyhow, think it's lot greater challenge -MR. JOHNSON.
 
 That's pretty awful.
 
 don't like myself. final
 MS. SEGER. That's right.
 comment involves inflation, Governor Angell made point
 commodity prices.
 don't think it's guaranteed
 going keep rising. know commodity prices
 volatile influenced many, many things beyond monetary
 policy. believe, said, factors work
 may, matter fact, keep control. Particularly
 think crude oil situation, I'm certain we're
 going get what's staff forecast.
 labor market
 shortage, don't think labor market; think
 sorts labor markets--for different skills, different
 industries, different geographic areas.
 don't know
 makes sense even talk natural rate unemployment
 don't know use guide. Finally, one
 things really don't think we're emphasizing enough
 see backbone among
 real change managerial attitudes.
 corporate executives labor negotiations I've seen
 whole working career, goes back long time. I'm really
 delighted see longer assume pass
 higher labor costs--which used do, particularly
 major industries.
 Also, company heads
 aware import competition, aware need
 efficient get even efficient.
 They're pushing
 employees moves would enhance productivity. going
 time auto negotiations. emphasis job
 security; even talk freezes actual wages.
 extent pay adjustments, number major companies
 making sure productivity gains offset
 1.1 percent--or whatever overall national number is-is productivity gains specific companies. so,
 think, tending tie wage
 settlements productivity enhancement moves. think
 put together don't see zero
 that's good.
 inflation, don't see 4-1/2 percent heading towards 14 percent
 either. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Corrigan.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, think we'll
 probably get little better sense things get back work
 earnest September businesses start planning
 
 1988. But, look things right now, first, think
 outlook economy better--not thought
 bad begin with. second, conclude
 inflation risks risen. terms "body english"
 
 8/18/87
 
 -20-
 
 put that, say--as think Mike Prell long time
 ago--that one way look simply higher degree
 confidence something approaching 3 percent real growth could
 realized. would simply add that, current circumstances,
 think keep mind something like staff forecast
 real growth isn't far optimal, considering need
 effect external adjustments talking
 maintain hope inflationary process get
 away us, number people suggested.
 all-important question external adjustment,
 it's worth, New York staff forecast little stronger
 overall real GNP.
 Interestingly enough, also one
 assumption dollar depreciation 1988,
 despite that, get better showing trade account
 current account nominal terms end place
 real terms. Now, reasons differences, think,
 important.
 One slightly stronger growth--not
 gangbuster pace means--but marginally stronger growth
 non-U.S. industrialized world staff forecast. second
 factor, course, without second third J-curve effect,
 nominal effects work right direction. finally,
 U.S. export prices going rapidly staff forecast
 does.
 one those, obviously, big "if" and, taken
 together, lot "ifs".
 key point
 suggest least possibility could get outcome
 better nominal terms real terms, without
 rely depreciation dollar,
 inflationary implications risk, course,
 depreciation dollar could get away us.
 think
 important another reason.
 tend look lot call "a
 domestic savings gap" trying figure terms
 capital savings requirements.
 things stand right now,
 assuming Federal budget deficit 1988 somewhere $150
 $160 billion range, fact matter made
 precious little progress reducing so-called domestic savings
 gap.
 budget deficit next year $150-$160 billion
 range, total net private investment 5 percent
 GNP, darn small, savings gap relative GNP still
 going 2-1/2 percent GNP.
 still going
 $145 $150 billion absolute terms--not peak
 1985 1986.
 So, fundamental disequilibrium still there.
 fact, improved much all, despite reductions
 seen budget deficit, saving rate
 economy whole slipped peaks 1985 1986--not
 decisively, enough problem, relative
 absolute terms, still much us throughout forecast
 period. says especially
 cautious, one way another residual going
 filled abroad, interest rates exchange rates going
 remain consistent kind economic profile
 forecasts talking about.
 inflation question, brief simply say
 number us, including myself, fretted past
 crossing threshold 4 percent deflator 5 percent
 consumer price index; seems consensus view,
 though universal view, among private economists others
 
 8/18/87
 
 -21-
 
 there. That, think, reality. things stand
 right now, postulate conditions would produce result
 better that, certainly don't think
 likely outcome.
 Indeed, guess I'd side says
 could also postulate conditions which, heaven forbid, could find
 looking 5 percent deflator 6 percent
 consumer price index. get point, looking
 situation inevitably carries risks highly
 destabilizing consequences real economy around
 world.
 Indeed, think lessons past clear: wait
 see kind problem staring face, costs
 unwinding going exponentially greater costs
 checking first place.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think overall
 numbers, rather satisfactory, good
 aggregate economy really good, sectors
 keep
 weak far sectors picking up.
 mind, think inflation picture also look little
 different looking aggregate economy
 whole. eliminating sectoral imbalances trade
 government sector well regional sectors pointed
 before. Overall, think makes healthier economy
 because, essence, pulling weak sectors without really
 hurting strong sectors present time. Consumers still
 moving forward rather subdued 4-1/2 percent pace
 overall forecast. agree President Morris said
 earlier: investment picture may actually little better
 numbers 3.8 4.2 percent next year suggest.
 I'd
 slightly optimistic there, much. export
 front, think also growth sustained doubledigit area; 12 percent Greenbook certainly sounding good.
 Turning price area, we're pickup
 sectors previously subdued, experience
 burst prices would associated overall Phillips
 curve.
 Therefore, also think employment gains
 achieved areas sectors, manufacturing
 agriculture, previously very, depressed indeed.
 Overall, think producer price index, pointed out,
 rather stable. agree Mr. Corrigan said:
 final user prices, GNP prices, drifting 4.5 percent
 rate.
 ask ourselves--this really
 reserved next part discussion, let bring up-if we're monetary growth right 5 percent we're
 price increases 4 5 percent, mean
 real economy want make equation square?
 certainly
 disagree view world we're zero growth.
 something else give. Either produce lot

 risks either side.

 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I've already made
 comments respect outlook general agreement
 Greenbook forecast.
 I'd like make brief, view
 time.
 regional economy we're experiencing Tenth
 District positive outlook sense that, others
 already commented, agricultural sector
 one best years, major rise net farm income.
 good crop. red meat industry very,
 good shape. result, uptick, least
 modest turnaround, falling agricultural land values.
 One survey shows first quarter second quarter,
 agricultural land values increased 1-1/2 percent;
 that's contrasted long period declining land values.
 would note, however, sales translated
 greater land value number one two kinds: 1) cash
 transactions neighboring producers picking depressed
 troubled land ownership; 2) Farm Credit System offering
 attractive financing rates move land books
 order avoid additional loss.
 would note that,
 result this, margins production red meat
 good moment.
 However, inventory beginning build,
 would expect would little additional pressure
 prices food sector result [uninteligible]--no
 real hope increased commodity prices either terms crops
 red meat. Lastly, optimism generated
 energy sector. drilling taking place; rig count
 modestly month two ago.
 So, psychologically, given
 see, would expect things continue improve
 slow rate.
 commercial real estate area,

 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I'd like spend
 second little different perspective.
 good staff forecast lot good comment it.

 might worthwhile put attention little whether

 there's analogy there, may happens sea:

 see several things
 could fundamentally deflationary long term.
 That's quarrel kind forecast we're seeing

 there's capital that's mobile enough get set

 it.
 There's lot pressure lot economies produce

 things seem possibly
 exerting [unintelligible] deflationary effect.
 And, see

 quarrel those, think maybe long-run deflationary
 effects surface might damp that, play
 inflation numbers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Boehne, comments
 you'd like make time?
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 No, none.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd like make
 observations. spent morning, one even mentioned
 stock market, find quite interesting itself. think it's
 important sense economic force, history tells us
 sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.
 It's conceivable me,
 however, may one times may begin
 see opening capital goods markets.
 It's dull;
 appropriations expanding rapid rate,
 expanding. think new orders showing mixed
 bag. Mike mentioned may exports orders,
 
 8/18/87
 
 also may seeing increase share total
 domestic capital investment markets because, remember, figures
 orders domestic facilities only. one thing seems
 appearing numbers, real terms, irrespective
 nominal trade figures, share capital investment coming
 abroad increasing dramatically, although it's beginning
 taper off.
 create much stronger set new orders
 figures equipment, see aggregate appropriation
 I'm little concerned
 numbers aggregate investment numbers.
 may looking opening area
 staff numbers show, part, think profit figures
 moving fairly quickly. ability pass prices another
 way saying margins opening up. beginning see
 clear evidence number areas picking
 form potentially significant profit expansion. would lead
 conclude could well running trouble
 monetary aggregate levels; impression is--at least hope is-to get little later. may looking
 think
 possibilities turn velocity numbers stage.
 presumption velocity stay somewhere area,

 even approximate staff forecast, may wishful thinking.
 think potential inflation side,
 nominal GNP side, fairly low credit monetary aggregate
 expansion think we're willing admit, reason
 think
 think we're merely projecting recent past.
 turning; turns, we'll possibly significant
 difficulties.
 exchange rate question, even though staff
 forecast, understand it, implied profit margins imported
 goods flat low levels--meaning import prices goods
 shipped United States essentially reflecting little
 change profit margins--I think history tells us doesn't
 happen often either. evidence suggests that, levels,
 likelihood increase margins--meaning
 increase import prices relative exchange rate.
 conclude that, staff forecast
 way likely forecast, I'd inclined suppose
 risks clearly upside, volume price.

 last forecast that's likely way Mike come
 next time around.
 MR. KELLEY.
 
 wouldn't surprised.

 risk inflation economy also history probably

 sentiment around table fluctuated good bit recent

 tightening appropriate; think premature

 So, would change, alternative B, asymmetrical

 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, going say that,
 ordinarily, would favor slight tightening,
 also going say would reluctant light

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. STERN.
 
 $600 million?
 
 Right around there, yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. I'm favor change, alternative
 B, $500 million borrowing target, three main reasons. One is,
 think Governor Angell emphasized, uncertainties
 facing. Another reason aren't many weeks
 meeting next FOMC meeting; another chance,

 soon, look things change approach, based additional
 readings economy. third reason don't see

 forecast certainly
 look pretty good; but, again, question whether we're going
 see hit trade turnaround way many
 expecting.
 So, reasons, would like propose keeping
 reserve pressures are. And, statement, would
 deemphasize impact dollar doing. Also,
 don't want tilt directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 First Vice President Hendricks.
 
 MR. HENDRICKS. see acceleration prices

 believe it's reasonable, point, increase pressure
 bank reserves moving toward "C" path.
 I'm particularly
 picking C alternative, favor $600 million borrowing
 objective.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER.
 definitely would put priorities
 side worrying inflation opposed recovery. would
 favor "B" tilt toward tightening. could certainly accept
 $600 borrowing target, although I'm voting, don't need
 accept it.
 I'd feel particularly strongly moving felt
 sort maintaining 6-1/2 6-3/4 percent funds rate
 strong demand reserves. Now, pointed
 before, Mr. Chairman, velocity argument, maybe won't see
 that. We're certainly maintaining lower funds rate would
 otherwise prevail rapid reserve injection here; that's
 come out.
 would inclined leave language

 think lost control dollar

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would prefer staying
 "B", largely reasons outlined minutes ago.

 think underlying trends going tend damp

 However, recognize short-term
 tendencies toward inflationary movement here.
 So, would also

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 want [on borrowing],
 
 MR. KELLEY. would stay "B", $500 million.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 guess see firming signals and,
 said, little upside risk before. But, lot
 early warning signals--some financial market signals--are
 showing us strong concern last meeting. So,
 I'm little reluctant see us stick neck far.

 I'm somewhere around alternative B asymmetric language give us

 sort like Wayne, I'm sure want commit anything

 read minutes six weeks, they'll look going
 made decisions. thing happened since last
 meeting real economy showing firmness, that's
 see right now. Maybe we'll ready tightening move
 later, favor alternative B, asymmetric language.
 deemphasizing dollar little because, said earlier,
 see somewhat influenced oil price; I'm sure
 declining oil price, might send dollar down, something
 worried about. dollar declined significantly,
 consistent decline oil prices 1986, saw
 inflationary expectations break face that; tried
 resist dollar's downward move; certainly wouldn't
 resistance inflationary expectations. I'd like avoid
 kind problem. think dollar still important issue,
 think depends what's influencing it. So, would rather
 highlight inflationary expectations leave dollar
 proxy that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 $500 million?
 
 Yes, $500 million, asymmetric language.

 MR. KOHN. Well, best guess alternative
