 3-1/2 year period, think-chairman volcker.
 
 rel intend?
 
 mr. johnson. ye--rel intend. wonder
 think chairman
 good feel might caus that?
 mention yesterdai plausibl explan certain period:
 obvious, get low friction level borrow-when you're target someth like $300 million less--the bia
 go upsid there's lot downsid
 opportun. there's posit bia appear occur
 long period. chart 2 summar inform, tend
 show target borrow level fairli low, that's
 lot posit bia occur. wonder went back
 longer period you'd still see posit bia it's
 relat also period target borrow high.
 mr. kohn.
 
 i'm not--
 
 mr. johnson. look chart 2 see posit
 bia there. wonder sens there.
 mr. kohn. think lot bia occur 1985,
 abstract recent period, separ subject.
 mr. johnson.
 
 right.
 
 borrow averag fairli
 
 low.
 mr. kohn. find low borrow versu high
 borrow didn't realli affect fund rate relationship
 much. howev, borrow low, tendenc come
 littl high someth unusu occur--for exampl,
 comput breakdown bank doesn't receiv wire
 littl borrow, particularli happen weekend--it
 give big boost rel low two-week averag.
 mr. johnson. ye, agre. seem
 ought factor expect borrow extent.
 mr. kohn. often that. peter sternlight comment
 thi. unusu amount borrow push
 borrow rel expect, can't take account
 ahead time natur don't anticip it.
 peter often take account intent rest
 period. think that's on offset get
 1985 period,
 keep fund rate close [expect].
 on thing go excess reserv rise
 
 7/7/87
 
 period rapidli expect to.
 kept write excess reserv number incorpor
 path; but, sens, lag littl behind
 happen. think period particular explan.
 chairman volcker. well, question remain--and mai
 know answer now--but on period chart
 borrow fairli high, 1984, bia didn't seem
 exist. typic, fact, period target
 $900 million, $1 billion, $1-1/2 billion?
 mr. kohn.
 
 don't know; find out.
 
 mr. johnson. would interest know that.
 two question. on major issu thi: realiz there's
 standard error plu minu--i'm talk borrow rel
 fund rate standard error mention 60
 basi point--that creat nois system. so, there's
 certain amount nois accept; that's plu
 minu. there's differ long-term issu
 detect sort shift. think question aris
 [unintellig] polici shift, we're make monetari
 polici adjust whether anyth not.
 question is: detect long-run shift borrow function
 try offset wai? otherwis, realli
 accept polici adjust nonborrow reserv go
 lower higher.
 chairman volcker.
 mr. johnson.
 
 equat polici interest rate.
 
 well, ye, nonborrow reserv would
 
 affect.
 chairman volcker.
 
 [unintellig.]
 
 mr. johnson. mayb borrow wouldn't, nonborrow
 path would affect extent.
 don't know-chairman volcker. question aros summer '84,
 instanc. got much higher fund rate given level
 borrow anticip.
 mr. johnson. question is:
 decid long-run shift function
 there's consensu develop?
 guess it's
 someth ought brought fomc, acknowledg
 there's shift then-chairman volcker. sure [unintellig]
 alreadi while, that's-mr. johnson.

 well, that's usual case.
 
 mr. johnson. that's usual case, ye.
 last
 question season borrow.
 seem
 there's alwai bit question whether season
 borrow includ and, so, extent.
 mr. kohn.
 
 find season borrow
 
 interest sensit--sensit spread. it's quit

 footnot here, fit whole equat--total
 season adjust borrow--on spread, cannot find

 so, kind find, would appear includ

 season borrow?
 
 sai?
 
 there's season
 
 mr. kohn. well, season season borrow,
 it's larg enough come overal--.
 look season borrow find signific season;

 mr. johnson.
 
 it's worth think about.
 
 mr. kohn. okai. on option would includ season
 extend credit. could treat exogen factor

 respond interest rate spread; it's truli season, that's
 sure.
 mr. johnson.

 mr. angel. think would better leav

 mr. sternlight. governor angel put finger
 sai need ask like adjust credit
 like someth want compens total, like
