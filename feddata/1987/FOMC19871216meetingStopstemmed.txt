 presum quit bank run heavi excess reserv
 carri-over period excess reserv laps,
 it's financi cost.
 true?
 mr. kohn. think true on reserv period-right reserv period late octob earli novemb-when excess reserv could carri
 new period.
 sinc then, observ that. excess reserv

 vice chairman corrigan.
 
 don't think so.
 
 mr. angel. mr. chairman, vice chairman corrigan express
 exactli wai would. is, sens, desir
 return borrow target, seem question
 is: best get awai situat market

 chairman greenspan. it's "in danger of".
 make judgment. real danger is-mr. angel.

 mr. angel. think mean get

 chairman greenspan.
 
 that's alwai case.
 
 mr. johnson. well, even consid get back

 target fund rate, predict relationship
 
 12/15-16/87
 
 borrow fund rate. don't now.
 can't take given spread right predict level
 borrow go result.
 

 
 mr. angel.
 seem predict;
 borrow close $200 - $250 million rang
 week feder fund rate close 6-3/4
 percent.
 so, seem me, somewhat predict.
 mr. johnson.
 
 well, let's ask expert.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 mr. johnson.
 
 context past.
 
 i've seen.
 
 mr. sternlight. last week borrow diverg
 would predict base experi, look back

 mr. parri.
 
 borrow would $400 million.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 tom melzer.
 
 mr. melzer. peter, question want ask
 thi: experi marketplac,
 evid shift borrow function?
 think
 look that.
 reason i'm ask recent
 reserv period miss roughli $80 million, believ.
 isn't
 $220 million borrow came in?
 mr. kohn.
 
 right, rel $300 million
 
 [in path].
 
 mr. melzer. okai.
 forc target $300
 million, would meant $1 billion $1-1/2 billion
 borrow last wednesdai; don't know would
 produc disastr result, end two-week statement
 period. even forc level borrow wednesdai
 measur volatil, gener period
 equilibrium fund rate might still perceiv 6-3/4
 6-7/8 percent. question evid stem thi: ask
 discount offic whether seen anyth unexpect
 district, hadn't term unwilling borrow.
 issu came up, guess, recent meet discount offic
 might attend. seen shift
 borrow function, it's realli associ octob 19th
 particular; go much longer period time.
 so, talk oper procedur base
 respons octob 19th, don't think shift
 look necessarili associ that.
 give
 chanc respond, on final comment.
 go
 back [to borrow target], think year-end would ideal time
 go back season pressur, often
 end quarter.
 fact, didn't, stabil
 fund rate year-end, might encount seriou
 technic problem get reserv back out.
 mr. kohn. let address question shift

 said, rel $400 million $450 million might
 expect. realli seem occur recent.
 don't
 know pinpoint octob 19th, don't think relat
 anyth discount offic discuss
 meet.
 term hear see data, peter heard
 anecdot least on larg institut turn
 thought knew larg institut stai
 market save chip year-end. secondli,
 data, see lack borrow much larg
 institut deposit $3 billion. small- mediums institut, region institut, borrow mai
 drop littl nearli much might expect, given

 think it's stock market declin, whole

 it's relat necessarili stock market;

 mr. boykin.
 
 that's also hear.
 
 chairman greenspan.

 mr. parri. think certainli would

 borrow along current track extrem difficult
 do. relationship discount rate market rate
 present level, close friction level,
 altern (4) probabl ought defer see someth
 would tradit relationship term demand

 vice chairman corrigan.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 higher interest rate.
 
 presid black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, think two kei question
 need consid. on whether fund rate
 give us right signal target borrow reserv,
 address staff. whether it's realli
 easier--from polit standpoint, follow jerri
 corrigan's point, inertia--to [make polici] move
 borrow reserv procedur. gener, feder fund rate
 probabl move right direct give correct signal
 us borrow reserv target. time
 
 12/15-16/87
 
 doesn't. exampl, 1984, around time continent
 illinoi bank crisi, chuck parte reassur market
 articl new york time target borrow
 reserv rise feder fund rate stem
 bank' unwilling borrow--that realli didn't anyth
 tighten polici particular time. also, right
 market crash 19th, think percept
 market probabl would tighten time realli
 didn't want happen. gener, borrow target probabl
 work [to give right signal] doesn't alwai work wai.
 there's lot jerri's argument inertia
 oper feder fund target; committe,
 doesn't know fund rate ought go, less apt move.
 also substanc, think, polit argument
 give us certain degre protect sai realli
 don't control feder fund rate, control borrow reserv.
 least on time think allevi concern
 congress gave us protect. i'm sure that's case
 much anymor, except mayb case congressmen.
 market seem look reason certain
 mind certain level rang feder fund rate.
 moreov, borrow realli doesn't chang feder fund
 rate chang, tend think that's realli want. so,
 would inclin someth like altern (3),
 go back borrow reserv target pai littl attent

 bob heller suggest--if ever get

 ms. seger. i'd like think two stage. on

 mr. angel.
 bank save free access

 mr. sternlight. particular comment heard relat
 four-dai period begin 31st.
 mr. angel. so, that's case, might expect
 larg jump borrow-mr. sternlight.
 
 could be.
 
 mr. angel. might also mean borrow could

 mr. sternlight.

 that's right.

 mr. johnson.
 
 that's right.
 
 mr. stern. do, come big

 mr. angel. then, fed fund rate would tend drop

 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid boehn.
 
 mr. boehn. think us wai look question
 whether want go back is, martha point out, look
 want get to. probabl gener agreement,
 share view, ought get back borrow object.
 it's question how. sens longer wait,
 difficult it's go be. mai long time
 get back normal time. clearli still unusu

 it's hard measur demand relationship. beyond
 that, credibl issu marketplac; sens
 longer stai procedur,
 credibl issu go come fore. also, think it's
 good specif kind goal, intern. so,
 think ought begin shift back someth along
 line altern (3), still give fair amount emphasi
 fund rate set us path back toward want
 be. come now.
 chairman greenspan. think that's right. fact, think
 we're alreadi begin see problem emerg. rather
 struck last two three dai fund rate
 sudden lock.
 mr. angel.
 
 that's right.
 
 chairman greenspan.
 mr. angel.
 
 hasn't budg all.
 
 it's 1970s again.
 
 chairman greenspan. it's extraordinari thing watch
 screen see high: 6-3/4 percent; low: 6-3/4 percent; last: 6-3/4
 percent. know market function. think
 interest question on ed boehn rais-name, longer wait effect transit back
 someth els, invari, greater jolt.
 think question we, suspect everyon
 doe, want get procedur point, also
 figur it. larg "add factor"
 equat fund rate on hand borrow
 requir other, implic shift back
 thing return normal know phase-down
 add factor go be--unless tom melzer right
 realli long-term trend it's never go go back.
 but, right moment, shift cover
 year-end period, actual transit mechan would
 subtl. longer wait, greater length
 transit. guess come pretti much governor johnson
 doe.
 get impress yet; word,

 it's go start becom counterproduct. question
 when.
 mr. johnson. would try first step?
 would try take current borrow result
 current fund rate-discount rate spread try target unless
 someth realli chang dramat? what?
 mr. kohn. well, think that's i'd start.
 depend
 committe's decis tomorrow. suppos, sake
 argument, committe want maintain someth like current
 reserv condit. don't know outcom current
 two-week period be, i'd tempt write someth
 order $250 million borrow, mayb littl lower-perhap $225 $200 million--and alert see thing
 come in. that's low, would expect higher
 new year. think you're right, governor johnson, there's
 lot uncertainti; also think interpret incom
 inform adjust borrow object look like
 wrong. now, there's fine line [focus
 the] feder fund rate.
 mr. johnson. guess i'd worri bob parri sai
 right--that everybodi gone cd market lock

 mr. johnson.
 
 ye, that's right.
 
 mr. black. unless uncertainti complet behind us,
 think try go direct, we'd make

 mr. parri.

 don't think market figur
 
 mr. black. ye, pretti quickli; first two three

 think.
 mr. angel. well, market go get

 mr. boykin. agre longer wait,

 mr. guffei. thank you, mr. chairman. fundament

 mean that?
 
 well, said nonborrow reserv.
 
 mr. guffei. no, no, beg pardon, didn't.
 said that; meant borrow target. i'd

 domest demand growth expect whole adjust,

 would requir growth u.s. manufactur output 5-1/2 6

 again, don't see could happen. would result

 third approach on think someth
 combin littl both: superimpos case 1, will, 10

 again, constraint current account balanc 1991,
 order get there, u.s. domest demand growth would
 someth like 1.2 percent; gnp growth, 2.5 2.6 percent; foreign
 demand growth, 3.5 percent; foreign gnp growth, 2.9 percent so.
 would requir manufactur output growth u.s. 41/4 4-1/2 percent capac growth 4 percent.
