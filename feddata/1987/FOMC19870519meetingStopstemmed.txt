 unhappi fund 6-1/2 6-3/4 percent even 6-7/8
 percent rang--contribut fund rate stai there, even
 though pure theori sens, go back earlier model
 relationship fund rate we'd expect $400 million
 borrow, would come someth consider lower
 would agre bluebook
 recent prevail rate.
 suggest tendenc rate drift back to, below, 61/2 percent level. on could even make case someth like 61/4 percent fund rate plan borrow hold $400
 million.
 mr. black. peter, someth said earlier suggest
 get drift back fund rate would
 expect see dollar weaken right much. fair read
 said?
 fund rate drift back that,
 mr. sternlight.
