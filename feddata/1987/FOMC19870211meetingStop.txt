 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Now, let's turn
 discussion. recited lot sounded like ancient
 history. History repeats every 3 days.
 MR. BOEHNE. noticed inflow

 MR. CROSS. Japanese tell us total long-term
 capital outflows continuing level last year.
 don't know, seems diversification; greater
 extent Japanese investment Australia Canada

 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 could add that: lot
 focus bond market weak dollar might mean foreign
 interest, especially Japanese interest, current Treasury

 firms becoming internationalized every thing
 take necessarily resale back Japan; but, certainly,
 great bulk is.

 MR. FORRESTAL. see shift Japanese

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Certainly, hear comments

 corporate issues--even higher-yield corporate issues.
 MR. BOEHNE. Sam, reference diversification mean
 diversification within U.S. diversification among countries?
 MR. CROSS. kinds going on.
 diversification among countries sense Japanese
 investment going Canada, Australia sterling--we don't

 diversification sense Peter mentioned:
 instead heavy concentration Treasury bonds,
 greater tendency buy corporate bonds, equities, real estate,
 forms investment. So, see types.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. questions?

 Meanwhile, economy less well.
 
 MR. CROSS. another point; German economy
 clearly less well appeared month ago.
 MR. BOEHNE. talk Germans Japanese

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Closer, yes. Close enough, don't know.
 Partly, think, result election pressure
 Germany politically something. Plus, economy quite visibly

 exactly fine tuner. Nonetheless, bound put somewhat

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 anybody still remains wide awake,
 questions?

 questions--?
 MR. BOEHNE.
 least one question. First all,
 think fellows outstanding job.
 easy task
 think outdid yourselves. said that, let ask
 question. key forecast happens
 international sector--to turnaround trade deficit.
 guess
 disappointed, we've disappointed
 turnaround hasn't come faster.
 often things happen slowly
 think economics; begin happen,
 sometimes surprise us happen quickly.

 question: Even though dealing trade deficit
 outside historical experience, anything history
 history countries suggest turnaround
 comes--even though may come slowly expected--that
 may occur faster think?
 MR. TRUMAN. time ago looked one part
 question--whether anyone ever turnaround magnitude.
 found number examples countries turnarounds

 unheard of.
 question whether would forecast
 period much turnaround projected here.
 fact,
 passing allusion 1978, shown first chart.
 1978 1979, share GNP, slightly larger
 swings. Basically, first quarter 1978 first
 quarter 1979 improvement something like 1-1/3
 percent GNP. essentially 1 percent several
 quarters.
 sense, less improvement stretched
 slightly longer period. However, think fair say
 conducive external environment periods.
 abroad developing countries, particularly, [growth]

 certainly one reason scale back

 historical equations tell us, maybe little gunshy, chosen go straight econometric
 equations tell us terms much improvement would
 period. That's number reasons,
 think everybody knows, including fact coming back
 strong position. third point would make relates
 whether disappointing. guess sense
 disappointing. look back forecast gave year
 ago, forecast U.S. current account last year, given
 conditions, reasonably close came with.
 Maybe people hoped would turnaround, don't
 think staff forecast whole substantially outside
 normal range error terms 1986.
 MR. JOHNSON. Ted, models actually

 agree you, wouldn't-MR. TRUMAN. would another $20 billion real net
 exports period went historical equations
 volume nonagricultural exports. anybody done
 knows, equations errors partly function
 errors happened recent period.
 error recent period, putting
 forecast together chosen, implicitly, increase rather
 reduce size. That's partly because, given relatively soggy
 environment rest world, feel limits
 rates U.S. exporters penetrate markets.
 Looking back it--and big qualification fourthquarter numbers still partly estimated--I think clear
 substantial improvement nonagricultural exports
 That's something borne Reserve Bank surveys
 1986.
 also statistics.
 MR. JOHNSON. think biggest issue lot
 people talk expect gains come import
 substitution, don't really show much all.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, coming import substitution
 sense still growing economy. fact,
 sense want look production side, demand side.
 Production growing 2-1/2 percent, normally would
 associated increase imports 2-1/2 percent
 course next two years. essentially none that.
 substitution effect comes, sense, two-year 6
 percent import growth otherwise would there. quite
 large number, looking actual decline.

 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 So, non-ag exports little slower.

 MR. PRELL. Well, periods find sustained low

 So, basis

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, stimulated ask two questions,
 Mr. Chairman. First, given relatively favorable numbers

 question would arise revision much larger

 So, sense might

 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Jim, Mike, forget one mentioned

 MR. TRUMAN. three things say.
 One

 Secondly, commented think

 Japanese
 want invest abroad insist protecting themselves,
 basically saying [unintelligible].
 place yendenominated investments abroad someone going take
 side currency position. enough
 people take current exchange rates, rates going
 go lower. That's think model.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. another way looking
 that.
 Chart 10, think, kind interesting. Roughly speaking,
 take three years 1983, 1984, 1985, cumulative
 current account deficits three years something like $280
 billion; cumulative current account deficits 1986, 1987,
 1988 something like $410 billion. looking
 situation three years now,
 finance 50 percent financed three earlier years-but context interest rate differentials exchange
 rate relationships very, different
 three-year period financing $280 billion opposed
 $410 billion whatever it's going be.
 could get lot
 tougher. conclusion one draws could well
 tougher--especially kind interest rate/exchange rate
 environment right now--to finance lies ahead
 finance came us.
 MR. HELLER. mind always two possible
 outcomes. one like scenario outlining--that
 dollar really plunge; possible outcome
 say okay, balance turning and, therefore,
 exports give confidence.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Still, markets people buy.

 not, think go

 said that, think noteworthy, Governor Heller
 mentioned, CPI--which incorporate higher import

 going take explanation, guess Chairman,
 contrast slow CPI numbers posted 1986 likely
 happen 1987 may significant--why

 also circumstances might tighten more.
 think alternative II send two-way street message.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would favor alternative II
 well. would make suggestion far sending message
 commitment price stability. work we've done
 indicates it's quite likely M2 grow lower end
 range and, reading Bluebook, got feeling
 quantitative work Board staff done would suggest
 well. seems one thing could 5-1/2
 8-1/2 percent M3 5 8 percent M2. change, far
 M2 concerned, would represent full percentage point decline
 1986. think would send message.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Would you?
 5-1/2 percent would what?
 
 way this?
 
 -30-
 
 2/10-11/87
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 M2 5 8 percent--
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 M2 5 8.
 
 MR. PARRY. M3 5-1/2 8-1/2 percent.
 work we've done would support and--maybe comment
 this--I think quantitative work Board staff done
 suggests M2 would grow low end range.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let pin down. read
 opposite someplace--maybe it--that M3 would grow less M2.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 No, no.
 
 MR. KOHN. Actually, judgment given
 expect bank thrift credit growth, tends drive M3
 managed liability component; expect
 decelerate substantially. M3 7 percent tick below,
 6-1/2 7 percent. M2 7 percent judgmental. Mr.
 Parry absolutely right sense quarterly model,
 tried indicate briefing, showing something order
 6 6-1/2 percent M2 growth, lower end
 range. think model showing like 5 5-1/2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 Governor Heller.
 
 models judgment.
 
 MR. HELLER. Well, I'm favor alternative II
 you've got bit confused. First all, let remark
 short-run alternatives. realize may want discuss later,
 target first three months rather high. It's

 high end range M2 lower end range M3.
 think that's Chairman Volcker talking about. San
 Francisco also got confused. favor discount rate
 cuts yet want tighter monetary target?
 MR. PARRY.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 don't vote discount rate.
 I'll stick alternative II.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. would definitely favor alternative I.
 choice, view, "II" "III". established
 pattern last years reducing range yearly
 basis alternative would certainly break that.
 alternatives II III, see particular reason choose
 alternative II, adopted [on tentative basis] last summer.
 Certainly, seems expectation hit
 alternative III might suggest change policy don't really
 intend particular point. So, I'd end alternative II.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'd reluctant reduce
 ranges full percentage point alternative III suggests,
 think we'd risk confusing market went alternative I.
 Besides, think staff made good case alternative II

 MR. BLACK.
 
 Mr. Melzer.
 
 I'll try keep short: alternative II.
 Well said.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Morris.
 
 MR. MORRIS. vote alternative II well. One thing
 ought keep mind elimination IRA accounts
 likely drive M2 relative income. That's I'd concerned
 moving M2 target 8 percent. may need little
 room that. Bluebook says don't expect much effect

 still think honest presentation would

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. favor alternative II well. it's

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 add Cleveland?
 
 Mr. Hendricks, something
 
 MR. HENDRICKS. also believe would appropriate
 adopt ranges 1987 set July, would
 favor alternative II.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, seem great unanimity.
 I,
 personally, could make case alternative III.
 thought
 Bluebook set rather convincingly won't make case.
 Alternative II obviously easy thing do; it's nice
 compromise.
 interpret mean, without rigid
 it, expect growth someplace middle range;
 time it's target set reasonably symmetrically around
 growth be.
 Let us turn M1 caveat--that wanted
 something like variant [in Bluebook], think

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Well, all--
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. looking terms

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 bracket something?
 
 would part first
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. No, first sentence.
 put something like this: "Looking 1987, context
 moderate economic growth, continued moderation inflationary forces,
 absent major changes interest rates exchange rates,

 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let make case
 because, obviously indicated earlier, way I'm

 MR. JOHNSON. you're basically saying

 don't.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, one way putting
 would expect velocity rise certain circumstances might

 appropriate. really want say is: shouldn't

 I'm
 concerned certain circumstances remaining high.

 really want say think low number would

 MR. KEEHN. Would go circumstances suggest

 It's hard put directive. think could

 Now, thought this, concerned

 kind language that's variant respect missing

 really exert control based behavior
 you're

 7 13 percent range certainly puts clear message
 well.

 That's point.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. People going think bit

 MR. MELZER. Okay, accept part, get

 It's M1 right one, get

 Given difficulties explaining this, feeling.
 Unfortunately, fact matter situation
