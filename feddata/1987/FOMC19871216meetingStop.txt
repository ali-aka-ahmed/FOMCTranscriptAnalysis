 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Don, one thing surprised me.

 seemed first weeks following October 19th
 banks would excess reserves could carry
 next period. $150 million $250 million, would
 presume quite banks running heavy excess reserves
 carry-over period excess reserves lapsing,
 it's financial cost.
 true?
 MR. KOHN. think true one reserve period-right reserve period late October early November-when excess reserves could carried
 new period.
 Since then, observed that. Excess reserves
 varied wide range, average--mostly
 carry-ins carry-outs--they really differed substantially

 So,

 MR. JOHNSON. No, view would you'd want

 interest rate got politicized Federal Reserve didn't
 really feel political-VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, think it's
 politicized. First all, said, think inhibition
 changing federal funds rate, quite apart political
 side it, shouldn't be. Peter touched this:
 market knows that's that's
 federal funds rate going be. simply loses--
 
 12/15-16/87
 
 MR. JOHNSON. think that's true funds rate

 funds rate going move narrow range. It's

 MR. JOHNSON. Well, that's right, off. One

 MR. HELLER. But, way around would work, too. I'm
 arguing it, fix fed funds rate see
 borrowing fluctuating, also gives information.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 Yes, either way.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 don't think so.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Corrigan expressed
 exactly way would. is, sense, desire
 return borrowing target, seems question
 is: best get away situation market
 danger interpreting actions pegging fed funds rate?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's "in danger of".
 making judgment. real danger is-MR. ANGELL.
 

 
 course are.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 --how get without
 
 creating--
 
 MR. ANGELL. think means getting
 somewhat problematic because, period following
 meeting, begin read things differently may assume
 made policy change don't think made policy
 change.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's always case.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Well, even consider getting back

 MR. ANGELL.
 seems predictable;
 borrowings close $200 - $250 million range
 weeks federal funds rate close 6-3/4

 So, seems me, somewhat predictable.

 Well, let's ask experts.

 That's also hear.

 would traditional relationship terms demand

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Higher interest rates.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, think two key questions
 need consider. One whether funds rate
 gives us right signals target borrowed reserves,
 addressed staff. whether it's really
 easier--from political standpoint, follow Jerry
 Corrigan's point, inertia--to [make policy] move
 borrowed reserve procedure. Generally, federal funds rate
 probably move right direction give correct signal
 using borrowed reserve target. times
 
 12/15-16/87
 
 doesn't. example, 1984, around time Continental
 Illinois Bank crisis, Chuck Partee reassure markets
 article New York Times targeting borrowed
 reserves rise federal funds rate stem
 banks' unwillingness borrow--that really didn't anything
 tightening policy particular time. Also, right
 market crash 19th, think perception
 market probably would tighten time really
 didn't want happen. general, borrowing target probably
 works [to give right signal] doesn't always work way.
 There's lot Jerry's argument inertia
 operating federal funds target; Committee,
 doesn't know funds rate ought go, less apt move.
 also substance, think, political argument
 gives us certain degree protection say really
 don't control federal funds rate, control borrowed reserves.
 least one time think alleviate concerns
 Congress gave us protection. I'm sure that's case
 much anymore, except maybe case Congressmen.
 market seems look reasonably certain
 mind certain level range federal funds rate.
 Moreover, borrowing really doesn't change federal funds
 rate change, tend think that's really want. So,
 would inclined something like alternative (3),
 go back borrowed reserve targeting pay little attention
 federal funds rate behaving way think
 ought to, deal ad hoc basis. real hope
 Bob Heller suggested--if ever get
 aggregates behaving normally--and is, make
 institutional changes move toward nonborrowed reserve target,
 would certain desirable automatic features would
 enable us ease tighten without take discretionary
 actions. would hope point move
 direction market gets largely demanddetermined think ought larger element supplydetermined misbehavior
 aggregates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 MS. SEGER. I'd like think two stages. One
 think useful normal typical times,
 things. times, I'm perfectly willing support approach
 emphasizes borrowings target, even though learned
 don't nice stable relationships, cannot predict
 exactly certain level borrowings produce way
 fed funds rates. times conditions unusual
 abnormal, personally believe still one
 modes moment. times like these, think ought
 pay lot attention fed funds markets very,
 nervous skittish--not much October 20th
 October 26th 28th whatever, don't think it's back
 normal. would hate see us give message inadvertently
 tightening engineering major policy change fed
 funds rates shot end year really didn't want
 give message. don't think everybody
 real economy markets comfortable what's going
 
 -10-

 Therefore, would urge us next weeks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. think useful way look question
 whether want go back is, Martha pointed out, look

 share view, ought get back borrowing objective.
 It's question how. sense longer wait,

 it's hard measure demand relationships. beyond
 that, credibility issue marketplace; sense

 think ought begin shift back something along

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think that's right. fact, think

 MR. ANGELL.
 
 That's right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.

 It's 1970s again.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's extraordinary thing watch
 screen see high: 6-3/4 percent; low: 6-3/4 percent; last: 6-3/4

 interesting question one Ed Boehne raised-namely, longer wait effect transition back
 something else, invariably, greater jolt.
 think question we, suspect everyone
 does, want get procedure point, also
 figure it. large "add factor"
 equations funds rate one hand borrowing
 requirements other, implication shifting back
 things returned normal know phase-down
 add factor going be--unless Tom Melzer right
 really long-term trend it's never going go back.
 But, right moment, shift cover

 subtle. longer wait, greater length
 transition. guess come pretty much Governor Johnson
 does.
 get impression yet; words,

 when.
 MR. JOHNSON. would try first step?
 Would try take current borrowings result
 current funds rate-discount rate spread try target unless
 something really changes dramatically? what?
 MR. KOHN. Well, think that's I'd start.
 depends
 Committee's decision tomorrow. Suppose, sake
 argument, Committee wanted maintain something like current
 reserve conditions. don't know outcome current
 two-week period be, I'd tempted write something
 order $250 million borrowings, maybe little lower-perhaps $225 $200 million--and alert see things
 coming in. That's low, would expect higher
 new year. think you're right, Governor Johnson, there's
 lot uncertainty; also think interpret incoming
 information adjust borrowing objective looks like
 wrong. Now, there's fine line [focusing
 the] federal funds rate.
 MR. JOHNSON. guess I'd worry Bob Parry saying
 right--that everybody gone CD market lock

 MR. PARRY. One interesting things, course,

 Definitely.

 Yes, that's right.

 Don't think market figure
 
 MR. BLACK. Yes, pretty quickly; first two three

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. agree longer wait,
 difficult is. agree going alternative (3), would
 interpret gradual move back, certainly one enough
 latitude back we're getting right reaction.
 respect it, don't know precise--and
 maybe oversimplification--but would say go

 factors affecting nonborrowed reserves aren't interest

 you'd gain. Perhaps that's improvement reserve

 think one times kinds

 right very, healthy terms talking

 marketplace difficulties aggregates
 interest rate targeting talked about, I'd say
 period--and think exacerbated--when
 going conflict pressures face
 domestically pressures face internationally terms
 policy conducted. And, think would better time
 kind intermediate target guide.
 wanted put table idea
 mentioned earlier looking monetary base target sort.
 question control that, think it's good
 indicator thrust policy. don't delusions
 ability pick specific growth rate base say
 therefore expect nominal GNP "Y". work done
 base income relationships would indicate
 relationship worse M2, example. But, that's really
 mind. think possible select relatively
 narrow channel terms possible growth rates base
 long run would consistent satisfactory economic
 performance and, time, preserve short run
 latitude react various types incoming data
 react now. words, approach I'm describing would
 allow discretion short-run conduct policy
 time--assuming stick --it would take away
 extremes possible policy results either direction:
 is, simply, either tight monetary policy, easy
 monetary policy.
 Right now, don't think lot confidence
 aggregates don't think marketplace pays much
 attention them. substitute kind base
 target, first all, think announcement would carry
 considerable positive impact market would
 know general policymakers going looking
 conduct policy. channel talked would
 tend eliminate uncertainty increase credibility. think
 existence target like that--if I'm right type
 environment we're apt next year
 even important way--could used diffuse domestic
 international pressures, something short-run conduct
 policy, particularly influence rates. long run,
 pursued religiously, think would tend result stable
 balanced economic results. So, guess wanted
 put idea table. We've done work, think
 lot work, support
 kind idea, maybe background work done it's something
 could discussed thoroughly February meeting.

 MS. SEGER.
 It's I'm cautious person,
 put lot eggs one basket think really make

 MR. TRUMAN. Well, think something close

 $14-1/2 billion GNP [basis]-MR. PARRY. small change like that, might
 early give 3 percent fourth quarter.
 MR. PRELL. Looking labor market data, could easily
 see 3 percent [GNP] growth. recall year ago
 fourth quarter looking strong labor input, even
 GNP revisions ended 1-1/2 percent. there's
 considerable looseness this; potential
 strong if, hope, wasn't inventory.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Mr. Prell

 not, let's go around table views
 economy. would like start off? Mr. Boykin.
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, far national economy,
 certainly agree Mike Prell's presentation. District,
 we're seeing slight improvement, think. course,
 little improvement see, we're growing slower pace
 parts country. considerable improvement

 agriculture; considerably better year. Energy,
 far least, held own. Construction, think, leveling
 out. Granted, energy bottom nothing going on,
 deterioration indicated. Manufacturing plus services
 remaining fairly even, although may see improvement
 services forecasting. So, it's really bright
 picture, think hope that, aside situation
 financial institutions, bottom
 improvement coming along.

 colleagues, way tried get fix dynamics
 long-term problem take couple simple arithmetic
 examples work back. first one simply postulated

 get given 1988 forecast like Greenbook.
 takes something like this: growth U.S. domestic demand
 1-1/2 1-3/4 percent entire period; growth U.S. GNP
 2-3/4 percent, growth foreign domestic demand 3-1/2
 growth foreign GNP 3 percent.
 percent
 implication, require, entire period, U.S.
 manufacturing output increasing 4 percent growth capacity
 plant equipment United States year-end 1988 levels
 something like 3-1/2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's annual?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes.
 Achieving either one,
 context kinds things going on, long
 shot.
 put argument, even things worked
 right, end-of-period situation, assumption, would still leave
 trade deficit $50 billion using conservative interest rate
 assumptions, current account deficit $77 billion, 1.3 percent
 GNP. net foreign indebtedness end period would
 $900 billion, 15 percent GNP, country net
 foreign indebtedness 15 percent GNP--other war time
 early stages development--is quite unusual indeed. That's
 kind gradual adjustment scenario.
 Incidentally, case also
 assumed change real exchange rate current levels.
 Another way think impose constraint
 current account balance end 1991, assuming
 change standard living means, among things,
 
 12/15-16/87
 
 -54-
 
 change real exchange rate.
 case, U.S. domestic demand
 kind assumption 2-1/2 percent real GNP would 4
 percent.
 Now, here's killer: foreign domestic demand would
 6.6 percent foreign GNP would 6 percent.

 point, course, don't see conceivable way get
 kinds assumptions--that is, maintaining
 domestic demand growth expecting whole adjustment,
 effect, going take place externally. kind scenario
 would require growth U.S. manufacturing output 5-1/2 6
 percent growth physical capacity 5-1/2 percent.
 Again, don't see could happen. would result
 trade surplus end 1991, $25 billion current account
 balance, net external debt would $785 billion, 121/2 percent GNP.
 third approach one think something
 combines little both: superimpose case 1, will, 10
 percent devaluation [of dollar] front-end loaded-in words, comes mostly early part next year.

 again, constraint current account balance 1991,
 order get there, U.S. domestic demand growth would
 something like 1.2 percent; GNP growth, 2.5 2.6 percent; foreign
 demand growth, 3.5 percent; foreign GNP growth, 2.9 percent so.
 would require manufacturing output growth U.S. 41/4 4-1/2 percent capacity growth 4 percent.
 would also get current account balance 1991.

 estimates obviously nothing exercise arithmetic
 there's suggestion anything that.
 Obviously, one could quibble one them, them,

 operating procedures terms emphasizing funds rate. So, I'd
 support alternative (1) see stable relationship develop.
 see that, I'm going back old procedures.
