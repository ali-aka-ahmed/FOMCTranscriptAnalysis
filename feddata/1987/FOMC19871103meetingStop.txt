 So, essence, give majority governing

 don't know bottom is.
 Obviously, lower

 MR. STERNLIGHT.
 now. certainly overwhelming presence tick-fortick linkage early year, although recent
 days bond market weakened response dollar weakening.
 But, mentioned, thought one reason linkage
 muted recently [market participants] saw earlier
 weakening dollar likely followed rapidly
 tightening monetary policy, whereas current context,
 don't see following quickly. still concern,
 though, weaker dollar discouraging factor either new
 inflows foreign capital market perhaps reason
 foreigners existing holdings market want pull out.
 remain sensitivity, think it's less.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 think careful
 say lower dollar basically induces individuals less
 interested dollars.
 Obviously, goes everything else
 know: lower price, greater demand.

 technical sense, every time get change exchange rate
 leads change long-term yields, looking at,
 effect, change far-distant forward position

 That's critical issue.

 And, conceivable get point--at point,
 hope--that exchange rate arrive level markets
 perceive go much further, forward position

 danger huge block U.S.
 dollar-denominated securities outstanding, psychological cracks could
 induce tremendously rapid changes create high degrees
 instability. So, think something happened last week.
 think
 one argue odd form delinking--that
 presumption declines dollar imply
 future declines dollar. trouble might
 happened last week, may what's happening week,
 yet next week markets might turn right around us go
 direction. But, think it's important think
 sense tight linkage Federal Reserve policy
 going do, although seem way.
 think
 remember dealing real variables markets
 tell us great deal respect.
 MR. JOHNSON. Peter, interpretation gone

 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, comment two questions
 concerning Greenbook forecast. comment: considering modest
 wealth cost capital effects stock market decline,
 also referred expected appreciable fall interest
 rates, it's surprising see real growth 1988 less

 talked past think even greater
 importance today. Real disposable income Greenbook forecast
 rises slowly relative real GNP really doubt
 forecast occur. difference growth rates 1.2 percentage
 points.
 forecast, there's difference one tenth
 point; Blue Chip consensus 30 economists, it's two tenths

 don't think ever high. question is:

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. PRELL.
 could cite figures: Going back
 third quarter 1986, PCE fixed-weight price measure rose 1

 Yes, depends lag, course.

 It's difference forecast.

 MR. PRELL. Obviously, know, it's confluence two
 things. One fast industrial output growing, quite

 obviously, assessment capacity growth. Business fixed

 Economic activity seemed good pretty much

 exports: seem increasing, also getting reports
 better export performance.
 It's difficult time,
 think, assess impact region events couple

 Everyone talk says business usual, although
 find little hard believe sure many

 think really saying

 near term, Mr. Chairman,
 don't think there's much doubt stock market related
 developments work direction weaker spending lower
 inflation. sure amounts
 sure one infer longer term. probably
 several dozen scenarios anybody could think of. Unlike Mr.
 Prell, don't put one paper but, thinking,
 two likely scenarios near term. One financial
 markets, mean them--exchange markets, bond
 markets, stock markets--kind settle less
 last couple days.
 don't know right
 now, qualify that.
 suppose Dow settles
 1900-2000 range, long bond settles 9 percent little
 little less, exchange markets roughly line
 [the levels of] recent days.
 Now, scenario, hunch
 economic performance respectable spectacular
 intermediate term--probably something like heard Mr. Parry
 describe, don't consider bad, way.
 scenario, think thought along one,
 isn't pretty. that's scenario whatever reason-because exchange markets go south budget negotiations
 rupture--there's sudden hit system. knows exact
 trigger might be, could find confronted another
 very, difficult turbulent set conditions financial
 markets.
 Obviously, can't put probability that.

 think two broad scenarios would warrant
 closest attention policy point view, guess
 two stick mind. Interestingly enough, least
 perspective, seem immediate policy
 implications imply need great deal
 caution policy, measured disciplined approach
 policy maintain maximum flexibility future.

 would also, may Mr. Chairman, like make comment

 it's extremely germane policy options

 germane. One dramatic increase debt, leveraging,
 recent years: ratio overall nonfinancial debt
 GNP--and understand limits data--has risen
 something like 1.41 early 1980s almost 1.81 early year.
 may coincidence--it probably is--but fact matter
 last time saw ratio range high
 late 1920s. it's government debt, although government
 debt lot it. Since first quarter 1984,
 net issuance equity $270 billion corporate debt
 $600 billion. Again, look problem government
 deficits savings, it's really quite dramatic. late 1970s,
 general U.S. government budget deficit percent net private
 savings averaged 10 percent.
 risen sharply throughout
 1980s, peaking 66 percent 1986. Indeed, 1986 federal
 budget deficit absorbed 90 percent net private
 savings. even 1987, absorption rate relative domestic
 savings fall mid-50 percent range. stress
 context discussion budget packages
 rest, think keep mind that, even
 best circumstances, kinds things talked

 Indeed,
 great likelihood budget deficit 1988 absolute terms
 larger 1987.
