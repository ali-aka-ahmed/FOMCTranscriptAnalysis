 abroad?
 MR. CROSS.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 addressing me?
 asked question.
 
 MR. CROSS. think certainly going continued
 watching whether policy commitments
 talked Paris actually carried via fiscal policy
 monetary policy. German economy soft; haven't really
 taken anything new. They, course, [unintelligible]
 time reconstitute government. economy
 weak, people seen done nothing
 monetary policy don't show much prospect anything
 fiscal policy except framework next year year
 next. Japanese economy equally well typically
 runs at, nothing happening there. problem
 get fiscal year get budget passed
 start new budget, say. Nonetheless,
 nobody seen anything.
 SPEAKER(?). haven't taken opportunity leave
 intervention unsterilized give boost monetary policy?
 MR. CROSS. think sterilized it. feel
 discount rate 2-1/2 percent gone pretty far.
 Also, people don't see anything U.S. side. make comments
 budget deficit one thing another,
 much evidence there. Still, main issue that's newspapers
 dispute trade matters raises people's minds
 possibility way deal trade--if really get
 trade war--is pound currency order deal
 situation way. main issue
 newspapers, trade disputes negative factor.
 Also, present circumstances, neutral statement U.S.
 officials seems taken market kind negative.
 It's lack positive firm commitment--I guess that's way
 put it.
 MR. HELLER. put lot emphasis statements,
 awful lot hot news bad too.
 trade numbers came bad. current account
 numbers bad. think real substance that-MR. CROSS. Absolutely. thought sentence somewhere
 haven't seen compelling evidence.
 [in statement].
 know exports looking better, forth on;
 looking trade deficits things like that, get
 
 3/31/87
 
 bad nominal trade deficits surpluses little, any,
 evidence reversal.
 SPEAKER(?).
 presume, Sam, firm commitment
 implies, among things, unsterilized intervention
 something else would back whatever statements made.
 MR. CROSS. Well, sure would imply unsterilized
 intervention think it's [unintelligible].
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Fiscal policy area; monetary
 
 policy.
 SPEAKER(?).
 Sam, would care speculate level
 yen would think Japanese investors might begin sell
 dollar assets--143, 142?
 MR. CROSS.
 don't really confidence people's
 attempts make estimates sort, sure
 number there.
 think depends upon people's attitudes
 changing time.
 think could
 confluence circumstances could lead sell.
 might go require that?
 sure specific
 number, think obviously dangerous area
 problems sort could build quickly cause great
 damage.
 SPEAKER(?).
 could also go low investors
 think bottom hit.
 MR. CROSS. Well, that's right--if one convinced
 that. But, again, don't think live kind world
 magic number hit it, everybody knows it,
 says: Okay, buy.
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, current published [foreign
 currency] directive limits operations countering disorderly
 market conditions.
 last episode seems maybe fall
 category; rather seems getting awfully close
 managed float situation which-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 well managed float.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. sure. point either
 directive changed going go route
 last couple weeks or, alternative,
 shouldn't doing--other commitment
 made Paris. speaks changing directive.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, approved directive
 little hesitant raise it, guess can.

 since looked this, take comfort says
 "shall generally directed countering disorderly monetary
 conditions."

 MR. GUFFEY. Article IV, read it, constraint

 MR. CROSS. think interpreted broadly enough

 category.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, don't know whether
 doesn't. guess going hard pressed make
 language. Maybe somebody look it.
 MR. GUFFEY.
 
 Maybe somebody look it, least.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. don't think sitting around
 table right now. designate Mr. Cross look see
 comes better ideas.
 MR. CROSS. Yes, look light

 MR. HELLER. Sam, consideration given forward

 MR. CROSS. one endless debates goes

 MR. PRELL. Well, interest rate [unintelligible] whole

 MR. JOHNSON. raises point asking
 yesterday; still haven't cleared quite head. got

 go together. dollar 6 8 percent lower

 Again, that's one factors viewed side

 That's right.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, think we're talking
 starting something like $300 million, pursued cautiously long
 exchange rate sensitive.
 exchange rate really got
 weak would contemplate moving certainly $400 million so.
 Much that, we'd want conference, anyway. would
 sense it.
 MR. JOHNSON. Yes, I'd rather say like $400 million,

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Obviously, would prefer see

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. put something like that,
 meaning is, understand correctly, would get concerned
 growth got 3 percent. would become factor saying

 MR. MELZER.
 
 Couldn't finesse that?
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [We would] move direction
 vice-versa it's 7 percent.
 MR. MELZER. Could deal less explicit

 MR. ANGELL.
 
 trouble with--
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. that, puts less emphasis
 foreign exchange markets thought people wanted.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Well, it's it's first.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Bob, problem don't specify

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. way written, would read

 way written suggests really worried

 MR. ANGELL. would suggest dollar

 us anyway. would worst worlds.
 MR. STERN.
 
 anxieties markets that's
 
 correct.
 MR. ANGELL. show control what's
 happening--that sitting without acting action
 needed.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, choices pretty simple.
 It's
 matter emphasis. write whole separate sentence
 dollar; Mr. Kohn one example. in-between
 course. take "taking account,"
 small change before--so small think it's
 almost invisible. left [unintelligible] directive.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 like way is.
 one
 technical question. say conditions domestic international
 credit markets. mean international credit markets
 separate minds developments foreign exchange
 markets?
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, don't know do.
 conditions credit markets avoid that.
 
 say
 
 MR. MELZER. way worded right now, though,
 seems looking aggregates all,
 wasn't advocating putting
 sure right.
 "depending on" phrase would put "taking
 account" litany things look at.
 Otherwise, we're
 saying don't take account making
 prediction think going come in.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's that's way
 traditionally it.
 better wording-MR. BOEHNE. wouldn't read way. seems
 saying expect consistent
 M2 M3 whatever rates growth decide on. M2
 M3 aren't consistent would probably want take
 another look situation.
 MR. GUFFEY.
 
 7-week intermeeting period?
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. want put sentence back
 ordinarily second sentence?
 
 3/31/87

 MR. MELZER.

 MR. ANGELL.
 thought feeling dollar
 move the-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Melzer would put
 taking account, understand right: "would acceptable

 expansion, progress..."
 That's easy do.
 MR. ANGELL. deal growth M2 M3?
 Suppose M2 M3 continue 4 percent path go
 the-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. still sentence
 put something there. least two proposals
 table. Mr. Angell's, 3 7 percent.
 somebody else's, "around 6 percent."
 substantive
 difference two.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.
 
 6 percent less.
 
 MR. KEEHN. thought: putting range of,
 say, 3 7 percent, lower annual range 5-1/2
 8-1/2 percent, condition regard time?
 Might suggest
 somebody we're easing policy here?
 Would putting
 lower range established year suggest
 sneaking policy change?
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 means rebasing.
 
 MR. KEEHN.
 It's different set numbers
 generally understood market.
 MR. MELZER. say "about 6 percent," it's pretty clear
 people shooting lower end cone,
 everybody knows uncertainty associated that.
 think we've
 already sent message say "about 6 percent."
 MR. KEEHN. may true past
 always hit trajectory exactly.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 Bob, better missing cone.
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 precise.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 don't go eight?

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. big deal here.
 rather
 like 3 7 percent think reflects flavor
 said. whether 3 7 percent precisely right

 MR. HELLER. would think 3 7 percent conveys
 tightening. all, midpoint 3 7 percent 5

 MR. ANGELL. it's really tightening.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. HELLER.
 alternative C.
 
 depends upon think
 
 wanting vote
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. talking aggregates
 pure simple, it's tightening. talking borrowing
 measure [unintelligible]-MR. HELLER. argue "C" think 3 7 percent
 would appropriate; don't argue "C"-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Alternative C says $500 million borrowing,
 people focusing on.
 MR. HELLER.
 5-1/2 percent.
 
 Well, growth rates Ms says 5
 
 MR. STERN. don't see all. think
 saying wouldn't concerned, things equal,
 aggregates came low side intermeeting period.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. could say growth M2 M3
 around 6 percent, Committee would-MR. HELLER. concerned either;
 concerned taking policy actions get there.
 MR. STERN.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 MR. HELLER.
 
 don't think that's contemplated.
 think need make clear though.
 think need make clear
 
 language.
 MR. JOHNSON. don't give impression say
 growth rate similar consistent alternative C.
 MR. ANGELL. substantial difference
 opinion here, environment weakening dollar
 commodity price effects associated weakening
 dollar, really want go above, say, 7 percent. really
 would want tighten environment. think
 policy difference that's cropping up.
 
 -51-
 
 3/31/87
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Look first two sentences
 operational paragraph say. First, change present.
 second sentence says might tightening. third
 sentence says expect consistent something
 "B" "C."
 That's right that's operational
 language says.
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. couldn't sentence Ms
 say Committee expects growth M2 M3 period
 March June rates 6 percent add language
 say would tolerant slower growth rates that,
 given circumstances rapid earlier growth.
 MR. JOHNSON. might clarify M2/M3 issue say
 would normally expect M2 M3, assuming change
 reserves.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. technically correct,
 attaches precision estimates never good.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 think Jerry saying--
 
 MR. JOHNSON. Otherwise may assuming change
 reserve restraint. put number say
 consistent change reserve restraint assuming
 change reserve restraint.
 MR. ANGELL. reason don't want reserve restraint
 right seems we've got low money
 growth path right now. don't know whether that's going continue
 not, light low growth path put restraint
 right runs risk willing take. growth
 path proceeds along bottom edge target-MR. JOHNSON.
 
 that's staff projecting.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. anybody support 4 7 percent,
 average 5-1/2 percent?
 MR. JOHNSON. projection M2 M3
 certain assumptions. Assuming change reserve restraint, it's
 certain amount; assuming differently it's different amount.
 that's building already happened aggregates.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 It's half point difference.
 
 MR. JOHNSON. saying would comfortable
 changing numbers said "might" something--if qualify
 say, assuming change reserve restraint, would expect M2
 M3 3 7 percent.
 MR. ANGELL. Assuming dollar continues
 present path assuming growth rate M2 return
 9 percent rate 8-1/2 percent rate, would want
 restraint?
 MR. JOHNSON. saying projection

 3/31/87

 assumptions get different paths. doubt it;
 certain conditions arose I'd want change conditions affecting
 that.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let talk 4 7 percent.
 change numbers. You're putting much weight
 staff's numbers. say want
 maybe tighter certain conditions.
 MR. JOHNSON.
 
 certain conditions.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, say expect approach--I
 would say "approach" instead "action"--to consistent
 range using two numbers allow normal one percentage point
 uncertainty around projection plus another one percentage point
 low side case tighten. Now, ought make
 beautifully consistent staff technically estimates.
 often put something like 5 7 percent range
 consistent 6 percent [expected].
 MR. JOHNSON. That's sort extracting midpoints.
 That's range midpoints.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 often it.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. trying consistent, becoming
 inconsistent simply saying don't want anything
 change. saying change, M2 M3
 growth rates relate change. don't know monetary
 aggregates would respond don't know
 response would be.
 MR. ANGELL. believe continuation M2 along 5
 percent path would consistent dollar stabilizing.
 MR. JOHNSON. That's true. That's staff

 MR. KOHN. staff would first admit

 MR. ANGELL.

 put M2 M3 range consistent operational

 Use

 say "Somewhat greater restraint would

 MR. MELZER. don't view third sentence really

 MR. JOHNSON. saying numbers

 MR. BOYKIN. wording, numbers associated

 It's substance.
 MR. JOHNSON. think it's easier assume

 means lower aggregates.
 MR. HELLER.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Greater reserve restraint would take place

 MR. JOHNSON. I'd say believe staff

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. JOHNSON. 4 percent project

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. allows change reserve
 restraint, possibility contingency. sentence
 located, encompasses contingency well. going
 look staff puts forecasts.
 MR. JOHNSON. seems going say
 "this action expected," assumption action
 taken change.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. would change word "action"
 "approach," encompasses first two sentences.
 MR. HELLER. Mr. Chairman, think that's see
 difference. third sentence says "This approach consistent
 growth M2 M3...", surmises sentence one
 sentence two. would rather way around say
 implementing policy existing degree reserve pressure
 approach consistent M2 M3 growth.
 would say things foreign exchange market happen,
 could bit restraint.
 
 -55-
 
 3/31/87
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's fine, interpret
 saying next sentence happens get slower
 growth aggregates. think substantively
 thing, sure that's way would interpreted.
 Ordinarily, now, second sentence read mean
 seek greater reserve restraint aggregates exceeding
 say. ordinary construction sentence.
 starts aggregates says take note
 change that.
 MR. ANGELL. That's moved aggregates down--so
 would less problem.
