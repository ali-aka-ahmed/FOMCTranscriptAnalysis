 MR. JOHNSON. Peter, mentioned market nervous.

 Isn't arithmetic get $600 million period
 would require tremendous borrowings today tomorrow?
 borrowings occur context knowledge meeting
 date, think [market participants] might make something
 rather saying, well, one way get average
 work right. don't think know shooting for.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. would take bulge borrowing get

 MS. SEGER. Yes, nervousness
 general, average, let's say, $625 $650 million, $2

 meet here--there must weirdos, anyway, think maybe

 might make something whole sequence.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. juxtaposition vis-a-vis

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 think critical questions
 regarding happens, much Wednesday,

 borrowing closely next maintenance period.
 MR. KEEHN. Peter, suggested increase longterm rates combination factors, inflation one.
 But, combination factors, persistent inflation

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, concern much tied

 MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, think even trade
 picture, partly domestic pressure because, redressing
 trade imbalance, you'll putting pressure domestic
 resources.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Following Chairman Greenspan's comment,
 Peter, suppose next maintenance period come
 pretty close $600 million market expects $500 $600
 million. Would expect much rate movement got closer
 figure?
 MR. STERNLIGHT. would expect modest firming. guess
 would get funds rates averaging 7-1/4 7-3/8
 percent area.
 think averaging 7.15 7.20 percent far

 9/22/87
 
 MR. PARRY. Peter, much discussion
 impact higher interest rates Treasury requirements? One hears
 lot discussion Administration recently deficit,
 least fiscal 1987, somewhat lower estimates
 revenues going up. don't hear much discussion
 impact higher interest rates future requirements.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. really heard discussion
 particular factor. However, people well pleased
 deficit coming fiscal year $160 billion, somewhat
 under, deep concern without Congress getting
 something together fiscal restraint, heading $20
 billion next year.

 not, entertain motion ratify.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Objections?
 
 Approved.
 
 Mr. Prell.
 
 MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think
 relatively brief morning. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you, Mr. Prell.
 
 Questions Mr.
 
 Prell?
 MR. FORRESTAL. thing kind jumped
 forecast time, guess before,
 real export side. showing marked deceleration
 [trade] deficit; real net exports, example, going [an annual
 rate $131 billion in] third quarter 1987 $63 billion
 fourth quarter 1988. forecasts
 seen would indicate nearly much progress. tell
 dramatic improvement based on? basically
 export side diminution imports combination both,
 what?
 MR. PRELL. Well, greater strength clearly
 export side. go forecast period end
 next year, modest increases imports; indeed, would
 expect real merchandise imports, [nominal] merchandise
 imports, going slightly, largely response past
 prospective depreciation dollar. also anticipating,
 course, domestic spending--consumption, particular--will
 growing rather slowly, won't sucking great volumes
 imports continuation kind demands
 seen previously.
 MR. TRUMAN. don't think govern
 [unintelligible].
 look outside forecasts go
 detail real exports [not] find much difference
 [unintelligible] exports forecast horizon
 ours. Generally, show substantial declines
 period. DRI, example, something close, almost shockingly
 close, have.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Heller.
 
 MR. HELLER. Mike, spoke sharp increases
 business equipment spending. break
 additional capacity efficiency enhancing?
 MR. PRELL. That's difficult get handle on.
 anecdotal evidence--or want characterize solid
 terms that, kinds survey information gathered
 McGraw Hill others--suggests vis-a-vis historical experience,
 distinctly above-average percentage planned spending
 designated replacement, modernization, on.
 Clearly, many industries plenty capacity; others
 less. one identify areas significant
 expansion capacity, additional plants built. But,
 generally, looking it, major thrust
 continuing reduce costs, modernize product line, on.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. likely show first
 increasing lead times delivery materials. words,
 leaving aside question pressures are, that's
 first sign going get something nature--that
 is, capacity expansion. got evidence part
 company difficulty maintaining deliveries
 relatively quick pace. correct assuming
 really major change, slight
 increase--
 
 MR. PRELL. materials, lead times
 lengthening. think, implicit comment, question
 whether increased levels comfortable,
 suspect strategy many firms run little
 tighter capacity might past. may
 uncomfortable seeing. capital goods
 area, average lead times don't seem lengthened much yet;
 probably consonant evidence capacity
 utilization equipment producing industries especially high-not one sees nondurable material areas, example.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. would like ask two questions
 assumption regard fiscal policy. time,
 case past, assumption spending cuts
 around $25 billion. think substantial risk
 materialize. work done suggests policy
 accommodative don't get $25 billion deduction
 spending, could add approximately percentage point growth
 1988 half percentage point inflation. Would think
 roughly [the magnitude]?
 MR. PRELL. take going zero deficit
 reduction action that.
 MR. PARRY.
 zero.
 
 don't get $25 billion reduction; get
 
 9/22/87
 
 MR. PRELL.
 think probably little higher
 normal econometric results would give us, clearly
 direction would go.
 point, $25 billion looks
 like reasonable ballpark figure, given discussed
 currently compromise--a Gramm-Rudman revision would
 something like $23 billion, loan sales sort thing.
 suppose still risks would less
 result might well somewhere
 zero $25 billion have.
 MR. PARRY. One question: notice change

 assumption made regard size deficit.
 guess would primarily higher interest rate assumption
 forecast horizon. feed back income?

 words, loop closed model get higher growth
 disposable income result higher interest payments
 deficit?
 MR. PRELL. Well, forecast isn't generated model,
 per se. go estimate income flows, definitely
 take account interest rate path we've assumed
 projected. substantial growth personal interest
 income projection period.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 would like follow Bob Forrestal's
 question. Basically, U.S. strategy turning trade deficit
 around shrink value dollar get trading
 partners grow faster growing. done fairly well
 dollar, haven't done well growth abroad.
 It's
 appealing strategy, strikes somewhat novel
 look history kinds adjustments. happened
 often country deficit ends
 recession.
 words, reduce domestic demand
 happening abroad also get downward adjustments
 currency. would think longer takes us make
 turnaround trade deficit--as get month month
 disappointing trade figures--that would put additional downward
 pressure dollar. might also begin raise expectations
 that, well, nice sounds try rather novel strategy,
 end, U.S. going go kind wringer,
 countries do. real question is: much novel
 experiment really running light happening
 countries happened history?

 hard time thinking country hasn't turned around kind
 trade deficit without fair amount suppression domestic
 demand. question aimed [criticism]; like
 approach on. strike somewhat novel
 broader stage history.
 would like see
 right lots company experiment.
 MR. TRUMAN. Well, truth matter is, President
 Boehne, examples successful.
 lot come early 1980s and, course,
 period essentially [slow growth of] GNP without going
 recession--that essentially question asking-in relatively short period time.
 several examples
 
 9/22/87
 
 early 1980s and, course, [unintelligible].

 side equation, mentioned, faster growth
 rest world, United States.

 examples. look record 18 months
 ago basically showed.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 sizable countries?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. Germany Japan [unintelligible].
 tend
 forget deficits late 1970s beginning
 1980s. moved small deficits large surpluses.
 One feature forecast that, don't recession
 GNP sense built in, relatively slow growth domestic
 demand. fact, quite dramatic slowing domestic demand
 built forecast.
 sense, Peter saying earlier
 answer question, that's part process--the process
 makes room external adjustment environment
 growth production whole kept relatively high
 domestic demand growth low.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Guffey.
 
 MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, couple questions
 Mike respect sections caught eye forecast.
 mentioned decline dollar assumed
 forecast. remember, Greenbook made reference
 decline much like projected last Greenbook. Further,
 remember, decline 10 percent annual basis,
 completed first half year. correct,
 decline assumed?
 MR. PRELL. guess wasn't clear. assumption
 dollar decline forecast period.

 purposes, put straight line path averages 10
 percent, annual rate.
 MR. GUFFEY. second question
 assumption rising interest rates fourth quarter.

 specific, level interest rates fourth
 quarter assumed forecast?
 MR. PRELL. isn't necessary precise
 course. put smooth trajectory moves federal funds
 rate, example, 8 8-1/2 percent range next spring.
 MR. GUFFEY.
 
 first quarter?
 
 MR. PRELL. would approaching end
 first quarter.
 don't want precise this.

 flatness next months increase later on,
 wouldn't able distinguish economic effects forecast
 period whole. gradual rise here.
 MR. GUFFEY. last question comment
 inflation picking up--I guess that's 1988, read
 Greenbook numbers correctly, forecast actually
 declining last quarter year, measured fixedweight index deflator itself.
 
 9/22/87
 
 MR. PRELL. There's difference forecast
 fixed-weight index,
 deflator fixed-weight GNP measure.
 3-1/4 percent third quarter 3-1/2 percent
 fourth, whereas there's deceleration 3-1/4 percent third
 quarter 2-1/2 percent deflator. difference
 peculiarities weighting shifts occur GNP
 deflator; decrease oil imports, relatively low
 weight deflator, actually tends depress GNP deflator
 relative fixed-weight measure. Basically, fairly
 steady second-half inflation, see it; it's lower
 first half, large part lower food energy price
 inflation.
 MR. GUFFEY. fair say, Mike, inflation
 second half, particularly last quarter maybe even
 first quarter 1988, reasonably stable forecast?
 underlying sense, fairly
 MR. PRELL.
 stable picture first second half, that's
 game stripping away food energy prices, obviously
 affected special nonmacroeconomic influences short run.
 course, peculiar things affect sectors, well.
 But, basically fairly stabilized underlying trend,
 increase next year rate price inflation.
 MR. PARRY. underlying inflation must pick quite
 bit, marked acceleration labor costs.
 MR. PRELL. people would take indicator
 underlying rate inflation. yes, do, compensation
 sense, underlying
 accelerates significantly next year.
 trend picking up.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, comments
 feeling last
 directed particular parts forecast.
 time economy would somewhat stronger
 Greenbook projecting, staff, indeed, moved
 forecast general direction. So, little quarrel
 done. think main driving force going
 improvement net exports goods services; plant
 equipment expenditures, particularly equipment area, also
 guess, would say
 provide pretty good push.
 really
 risk might still forecast little low.
 bothers us, guess, feeling might right
 saying that, I'm focusing inflation rate
 forecast.
 projecting next year--when goes 4-1/2
 think ought able better next
 percent.
 4-1/2
 year, ought target something less that.
 percent inflation rate could easily become 5 percent; 5 percent
 So, rather thinking
 really reasonable price stability.
 may overestimated, we're afraid might right
 come results little strong
 price side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Seger.
 
 9/22/87
 
 -10-
 
 MS. SEGER. Yes, couple questions
 tied matters discussed yesterday pre-FOMC
 briefings. involve whether completely factored
 rise interest rates already seen, plus wholly
 factored increases think yet come.

 particular, housing starts, last month 1.6
 million annual rate, know problems high vacancy
 rates multifamily area, least parts country.
 incentives built kind housing shifted
 greatly Tax Reform Act. single family starts, least
 people say sensitive interest rate changes.
 guess
 hard time believing 1988 starts fall
 1-1/2 million.
 hope don't, sort skittish
 this.
 MR. PRELL.
 It's purely conjectural point.
 Various
 econometric models would suggest that, relevant horizon here,
 probably dealing interest rate elasticity 1.
 rise mortgage rates around 10-1/2 percent
 something high 11's, [an increase of] roughly 10 percent.
 roughly 10 percent decline housing starts, 1.6 million
 something around 1.45 million area. sense, it's well
 line historical patterns. thing provides
 comfort-MS. SEGER.
 multifamily?
 
 true single family
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, I'm looking aggregate:
 clearly, affected change interest rates.
 Looking another angle, mortgage rates back levels
 saw 1985, considerably higher housing starts then--in
 1.7 million area. Now, we've probably gone catchup
 period home ownership, number seems fairly reasonable
 us, looking response we've seen far substantial
 increase mortgage rates.
 hasn't made market fall apart
 entirely. may quite right, stab
 think normal response.
 MS. SEGER. means lags longer?
 Maybe haven't even seen full impact spike back
 April May, quite dramatic.
 MR. PRELL. Well, clearly, felt would seeing
 much response summer, even elevated rate
 forecast beyond earlier. modest
 decline 1.6 million level previous forecast.
 taken mortgage rates more, lowered housing
 starts further.
 It's difficult say. noted,
 influences work, may still adjustment
 tax law changes. still problems high vacancy
 rates home rental properties various parts country.
 Again, look house prices, too, evidence suggests
 that, least many markets, there's still pretty robust demand
 interest rates. anecdotal evidence
 suggest us way mark assessment demand
 positions. Even survey information suggests pretty high numbers
 
 -11-
 
 9/22/87
 
 people whose attitude good time buy house.
 may surprising, seems pattern.
 MS. SEGER. question ties
 yesterday's briefing, relates heavy reliance trade
 turnaround produce good 1988. I'm reading numbers right,
 half real GNP growth, fourth quarter 1987 fourth
 quarter 1988, expected come improvement net exports.
 Again, think it's very, difficult get $54 billion increase
 exports one year--namely, year--and tack $57
 billion next year. That's lot produce.
 MR. PRELL. One main comforts find
 numbers looks us like trend real exports
 quite strong thus far. based exchange rate projection
 assumption probably still lags order
 delivery process, means improvement exports
 still fully evident. think forecasting,
 basically, continuation patterns already perceptible.
 respects, think greater concern, given outlook, would
 get improvement net exports somehow,
 also get greater domestic demand growth. puts still greater
 pressures resources people would thought
 past. two years now, forecast, consumption growth
 really subpar historically. So, sense,
 things put together way gives rather smooth adjustment
 picture.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. don't question.
 comment outlook.
 minutes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 President Parry.
 
 would like
 
 Well, you'll hold
 
 MR. PARRY. want raise issue shed little
 light concern slowing interest-sensitive
 sectors economy, housing. seems
 economy operating is, terms employment least,
 get slowing interest-sensitive sectors
 economy time going get strength net
 exports, would real problem. So, one concerned
 implications housing sectors picture
 doesn't really fit together well don't get kind
 slump. would assume that's problem.
 MR. PRELL. That's characterizes outlook think
 comments around table suggest hopeful
 aspect this--that everything falls nicely place.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Mr. Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. Mike, linkage dollar weakness
 inflationary expectations isn't broken, weren't able,
 example, achieve forecast period 10 percent annual
 decline dollar--let's say becomes impossible-how would affect forecast broad sense? words,
 
 -12-
 
 9/22/87
 
 couldn't achieve external adjustment
 foreign exchange price mechanism-MR. PRELL.
 
 words, dollar--I wasn't clear what--
 
 MR. MELZER. I'm saying box right
 that, practical matter, tolerate dollar
 decline, kicks inflationary expectations.
 So, let's say
 would affect
 assumed dollar stable.
 forecast?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 depends bit, think, else going
 time. Much impetus net exports
 dollar, least far forecast horizon goes,
 already train. Less half increase next year net
 exports directly traceable projected dollar decline.
 But, presumably, didn't dollar decline,

 wouldn't kind pressures interest rates.
 would less pressures interest-sensitive sectors
 economy.
 compensation terms economy's
 operation whole which, turn, would tend feed back
 net exports, would less improvement net exports
 too.
 But, certain sense [unintelligible]
 basically way think this.
 MR. HELLER. Wait minute. say interest rates
 wouldn't rising; also come scenario
 continued stable dollar comes raising
 interest rates country. Then, would answer
 different?
 MR. TRUMAN. scenario, maybe instead $50
 billion change net exports would something like $20-$25
 billion.
 would less 1 percent GNP
 forecast, that's well within error. Mike put way
 overall forecast.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Johnson.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.
 guess sort going
 ask. One question mind: I'm big "aggregates
 person" but, line whole issue aggregate demand,
 strikes recent uptick interest rates going
 damping effect aggregates.
 think fine,
 point, ask much aggregate demand plausible
 scenario.
 think restraining it. come
 fairly implausible velocity growth numbers get
 aggregate demand outside range would present real breakout
 overall aggregate demand.
 seems pretty
 well cornered here.
 long run, could couple bad
 quarters scenario but, given recent moves interest
 rates, projecting broader monetary aggregates?
 MR. KOHN. saw Bluebook, projecting
 rise interest rates, large
 significant, would damp growth M2 coming months.
 
 MR. JOHNSON.

 MR. KOHN. abstract September

 next year, assumption moderate increases
 interest rates, would M2 growth 4-1/2 5 percent
 kind range.
 implies-MR. JOHNSON.
 
 would pick higher interest
 
 rates?
 MR. KOHN. Well, first all, rate increase
 things
 interest rates may quite great.
 seem depressing M2 growth really couldn't
 account year assuming won't quite
 active next year. example, IRAs won't around,
 might boost M2 growth little; so, assumed pickup
 came about, GNP projection
 growth next year.
 would imply 2 percent increase velocity. But, remember,
 we're damping domestic demand here; slower domestic demand
 GNP, look velocity perspective,
 wouldn't quite big increase. That's large
 increase-MR. JOHNSON. That's sort I'm getting at.
 cornered little, seems me.
 

 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Could raise question
 GNP demand numbers would really look like recognize
 way calculate numbers function fact
 looking fixed-weight GNP
 using 1982 base period?
 deflator versus GNP deflator, tends pick difference
 mix, essentially issue far
 deflate nominal GNP
 base period large extent.
 fixed-weight index--which roughly, quite,
 equivalent moving 1982 base 1987, current year--it
 seems though we're getting good deal less way real
 growth. Let's take case point: fourth-quarter fourthquarter change year next, respect difference
 GNP deflator fixed-weight deflator, .3 .4,
 respectively. Assuming nominal same, would
 reduce real growth. problem that, however,
 I'm sure whether model generating real first then,
 implication, nominal, vice versa. look
 issue?
 words, interpret that?
 MR. PRELL. Well, it's difficult dissect precisely,
 think dealing mostly process looks
 real first, infers pressures resources,
 feed back short-run Phillips curve relation wage
 price side. That's stylistic characterization.
 1982, oil
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's specific.
 prices, overall import prices, much higher now.
 Therefore, rise oil imports import side real GNP

 larger subtraction 1982 base 1987 base.
 guess I'm really asking restructure total system
 say, 1987, equals 100 instead 1982, would real GNP
 look context?
 
 9/22/87
 
 -14-
 
 Mr. TRUMAN. two years, 1987 1988, oil imports
 don't rise much. may get effect GNP extent
 don't rise domestic production oil
 energy, measured 1982 dollars. there's much subtraction,
 even forecast, higher oil imports fourth quarter

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Also, assume overall non-oil
 import price deflator significantly lower 1982,
 which, recall-MR. TRUMAN. remember, 100; maybe I'm
 points.
 non-oil price deflator running
 100.3 second quarter.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. means it's relative issue
 domestic thing [unintelligible]?
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 Well, would get impact, guess,
 
 that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. reason raise issue
 it's becoming crucial question, statistics, real
 evaluation here. trying determine extent net
 exports crucial issue. getting signals
 industrial production index. basically saying, anything,
 cutting edge net export figures much sharper,
 speak--much positive--than GNP numbers implying,
 getting extraordinary strength industrial production.
 read way?
 that-MR. TRUMAN. don't know extraordinary; maybe
 comments earlier suggested that.
 One problem that,
 extent get going on, you're producing things which,
 course, you're shipping abroad; don't see showing

 think implicit

 questions hypothesis.
 MR. PRELL. might note that, industrial

 tentative--that growth well within range variation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Mike
 go general comments? May request that, general
 comments, address one question bothering particularly,
 would appreciate
 think it's really crucial outlook.
 hearing views interpret rise long-term
 Treasury rates--that is, extent would disaggregate
 rise inflation premiums, expectations instability premiums,
 expectations instability

 premiums mean expectations bond prices fluctuate

 MR. BOEHNE. Let comment Philadelphia region.

 Jersey, Delaware eastern Pennsylvania continue low
 unemployment rates. matter fact, think there's
 drag growth areas, there's labor shortage
 Even
 business firms simply can't keep production needs.
 traditional manufacturing areas District showing
 improvement, unemployment coming areas well.
 residential nonresidential construction strong;
 retail sales healthy, except autos; loan growth running

 three times national average. So, rather bullish
 region constrained mostly think lack
 aggregate demand, labor. concern picked
 last couple months, mostly business community, concern
 inflation. think it's triggered labor

 shortages people report, particularly entry level.
 look help wanted ads newspapers, help
 wanted signs generally, pretty high levels. wage
 increases reasonably moderate, think lot people
 business community concerned kind
 situation triggers wage-price kind spiral.
 national scene, think Greenbook numbers look
 terms risks--and influenced
 reasonably good.
 sit people talk to--it seems
 whatever risks weak economy, even
 recession 1988, shrunk considerably. see risks
 side triggering kind wage-price increase.
 one point, however, outlook think bears
 mentioning, fundamentals trade
 situation indicate continuing downward movement value
 dollar. Indeed, reflected Greenbook forecast.

 think fundamentals way winning out, even central

 So, aggregate numbers look
 very'much same, lies beneath quite different insofar

 inflation outlook, despite
 fact dollar stable, same, maybe
 shade worse Greenbook.
 Mr. Boehne raised question earlier discussion
 overall adjustment process I'd like comment
 briefly, turn back. think, Ed, question was:
 work?
 scale problem big can't get
 there?
 look big three countries--the United
 States, Germany, Japan--the fact matter
 conventional standards adjustment well underway sense
 1986 1987, forecast 1988, growth
 domestic demand Germany Japan stronger

 significantly stronger growth GNP.
 case United States, still domestic demand stronger
 GNP 1986; 1987, forecast well-although differences there--you get widening
 GNP growth United States something like percentage
 point greater growth domestic demand.
 true overall
 growth Germany Japan perhaps lower one would like
 see.
 But, dynamics adjustment set in, think
 inconsequential way. Again, evidence three
 major countries basically working way textbook says
 should. problem, extent, Ed touched earlier,
 scale adjustment talking
 scale adjustment needed. look terms
 behavior exports--and relevant outlook,
 I'm getting roundabout way--we know numbers
 lousy, numbers July 1987 versus July 1986 indicate
 U.S. export growth really been, think say, almost
 spectacular. it's confined handful products
 handful countries; it's pretty much across board,
 including sharp increases exports even Japan. strength
 export numbers context overall dynamics
 adjustment raises couple questions mind. What's offsetting
 part, course, imports. imports still very,
 strong, across board, exceptions--perhaps lumber.
 But, large, imports still humming lot
 price. again, many J curves see terms
 import prices?
 That's one reasons like forecast--at
 least right now--better like Board staff's forecast. But,
 put together, leads one two possible
 conclusions. One really something systematically
 wrong trade numbers, least see month month.
 second domestic economy is, fact, stronger
 think is, least conventional measures telling
 us. hunch probably things true:
 trade numbers messed domestic economy,
 anything, actually bit stronger think is.

 Yes.

 think that's kind box long fiscal

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would start
 region, repeating said last month--that economic
 conditions Sixth District really booming seem
 strengthening. reports we're getting directors
 business people extremely positive point
 optimistic. And, it's fairly much across board.
 example, seeing increasing evidence improvement
 tradeable goods areas, certainly textiles. also getting
 improvement apparel production. Paper production chemicals

 also lot better, might say paper textile
 mills factories going flat moment area.
 hearing labor shortages, particularly textile
 areas, bottlenecks beginning appear.
 example, reports shipments carpeting delayed
 labor shortages.
 said that, point
 least, seen yet pressures wages, since labor seems
 moving slower-growth areas areas
 picking up.
 far, wage pressures followed, least
 immediately, labor shortages. Even commercial

 rapidly, particularly true fast growing states
 Georgia, Florida, Tennessee.
 Construction figures also.
 getting absorption; getting construction,
 particularly hospital warehouse operations.
 Rising
 mortgage rates cut housing sector, particularly
 multifamily area.

 Turning general forecast, forecast last
 half year strengthened bit comparison
 month ago.
 Consumption seems picked somewhat
 anticipated seeing investment respond higher
 plant utilization. Looking ahead 1988, marginally lower
 time last meeting, line
 Greenbook forecast. difference
 staff forecast area consumption which, course, I've
 mentioned couple times before. And, indicated earlier,
 don't see quite level improvement net exports staff
 seeing. net out, pretty close 1988.
 Also, think significant, far forecast concerned,
 build forecast tightening monetary
 policy, apparently staff did.
 price side, again,
 we're pretty close Greenbook forecast. So, put
 together, Mr. Chairman, seems forecast reasonable
 even little optimistic.
 would agree would
 put risk upside rather downside.
 respect question, think probably
 ingredients both. least sit,
 inflationary expectation higher rates, large extent,
 think real. said that, seems
 market participants I've talked to, may

 reactions even minor declines value dollar
 producing higher rates might called for.
 don't know
 assess this, really; I'm talking people

 So, may get equally bad trade numbers. And,

 every snippet bad news find reacting that,
 rather trying find something positive scenario.

 still lot capacity
 manufacturing process but, nevertheless, business seems
 gotten better. Pricing still tough, however.
 Nevertheless, District's perspective, good.
 Let say quick word agriculture adding little
 I've said past: namely, conditions seem
 stabilized, albeit low levels. Land values beginning move;
 transactions higher, couple instances, significantly
 higher. But, point I'd make find new
 development general business conditions, agricultural
 conditions, area Iowa seem better.
 Turning price issue, must say find
 very, difficult read.
 keep hearing price increases; I've
 commented steel, specialized chemicals, paper, paper products,
 brass, copper seem moving price.
 don't show
 yet CPI numbers. competitive conditions finished
 products tough people squeezed margins; but,
 point, think going poke
 through. wage side, I'd add comments
 hearing shortages. Michigan day
 presentation people commenting
 can't get enough people work operations there.

 would think that, point, going see something
 increase wage rates that's beyond we've last year
 so.
 
 Turning then, Mr. Chairman, question long-term
 rates, very, key issue, like Jerry, think
 awfully hard analyze part. But, think underlying
 rate economic activity pretty good; may little
 rapid expected and, therefore, may real pressure
 rates. Also--and can't analyze part equals what--on
 inflation side, think growing skepticism there;
 concern inflation, something rate increase
 experienced certainly relate that. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 Mr. Boykin.
 
 MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, guess it's somebody's turn
 say something quite positive hearing. guess
 falls lot, Eleventh District. would
 characterize economy Eleventh District still somewhat
 sluggish little fragile, although tentative
 signs improvement. Businesses around District serve
 national international market seem saying
 seeing improvement. would primarily electronics,
 livestock, chemicals, defense. little optimism
 there. businesses serve local area region,

 increase oil rig count additional activity going on,
 optimism. little activity related
 businesses; construction-related manufacturing growing.
 Agriculture stabilizing, cotton livestock farming

 Pick newspaper you'll still find reports foreclosures

 three fairly well known good projects. doesn't mean
 foreclosures actually occur; postings could part
 renegotiation. Nevertheless, upsetting. saw report last
 week Dallas lost 40,000 jobs last year. seems
 awfully high me, kinds reports hearing.
 Though hope comeback trail--and, oil prices
 hold, think be--I don't think seen bottom

 worrying least two years, possibly three,
 work that.
 national picture, possibly I'm somewhat

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid owe apology
 discussed thoughts state U.S. economy

 last question posed best can, well.
 think look negative correlation

 get answer that. three possible explanations: one
 resulted still third factor, rise
 inflationary expectations. second--and maybe popular
 explanation it--is decline dollar rate

 So, that's

 One last point interest rate question: suspect it's

 think one things seeing people

 So, think there's certain

 ways, doesn't
 bother see long-term interest rates high.
 think would
 bother U.S. Congress. hope would bother them, hope
 would indicate much opportunity help
 controlling spending.
 regard Greenbook forecast, really
 significant disagreement 1987 forecast. staff
 lowering inflation rates second half 1987, don't
 see much disagreement there. three areas difference
 regard 1988 forecast.
 disagree, guess, Martha
 others took one position regard real exports.
 I'm
 taking another position: believe real exports maintain longer
 sustained growth path assumed forecast.
 believe
 many producers United States never learned
 involved international markets. United States
 became huge importer, began change whole nature
 opportunities exist.
 So, many, many small
 medium-size businesses never taken international market
 seriously, learning compete
 international marketplaces home abroad. think
 long learning curve involved here. lot financial
 institutions done well regard recognizing
 export lending. think learning curve also occur.
 Therefore, expect present exchange rates give us
 wonderful opportunity long period export increases.
 second disagreement 1988 forecast--and
 know Mike, maybe Ted, mentioned GNP deflator
 strange behavior--I would point staff's numbers CPI.
 July, staff forecast 60 basis point increase CPI
 third quarter 1987 fourth quarter 1988.
 projecting 150 basis points increase CPI.
 Now,
 really making things get worse rather rapidly.
 think that's
 likely, first all, businesses found
 environment one make profits able
 increase prices learning control costs.
 So,
 think different environment were.
 Second,
 already gone big oil price increase, staff
 telling us occurred earlier.
 second half
 1987 hit us, think kind passed us.
 Third, think foreign exchange rates likely fall
 amount [indicated forecast], would presume
 majority Committee would believe inflation
 forecast acceptable would willing take
 steps necessary inflation rates
 
 -27-

 materialize. Consequently, dollar behave quite well
 environment.
 third disagreement [with forecast] regard
 tax receipts.
 think everyone underestimating effects

 evidence shows tax receipts coming higher
 anticipated. going tax receipts going

 agricultural land prices stabilized, modest

 So, agriculture, low

 interest rate question, old lady

 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. seems me,
 I've listened comments made around table morning,
 there's very, strong centralizing character projections
 made everyone--the Greenbook District
 forecasts. think constitute, aggregate wisdom,
 responsible good forecast; accept it.
 would like
 make comment: projections arise, must,
 conventional economic analysis historical experience; would
 like suggest maybe little open alert
 possibility unconventional untraditional
 things going on. Standing back trees looking
 forest, observe end fifth year
 called recovery. I'm sure long call something
 recovery, one going five years old another couple
 months; note end fifth year economy
 is, fact, accelerating inflation declining measures.
 Inflation projected increase good reasons,
 right you've got economy accelerating inflation
 decreasing--which pretty unconventional. Industrial
 production going accelerating rate; unemployment
 dropping strongly probably somewhere near natural
 rate. yet, time, seeing very, small
 increases unit costs production flat producer
 price index. fact, last month, PPI zero. seems
 little unconventional untraditional. trade balance
 J curve, getting effects would
 expected. stretching out; still think going
 there, behaving unconventionally. Governor
 Johnson noted moments ago fact taken $60
 billion fiscal stimulus economy, yet none
 trade deficit. think lot people would surprised
 ahead time two things could coexisted.
 Incidentally, economy accelerating growth rate,
 occurring $60 billion fiscal stimulus is, fact, coming
 economy.
 would suggest possibility inflation may behave
 untraditional way also. Maybe also stretch
 accelerate. ask myself: possibility could occur?
 see several possibilities. soft, would hate
 
 9/22/87

 try defend them. But, one thing, suspect
 may undermeasuring productivity increase. may
 better know. I've talked Mike Prell others
 some. think much higher level mobility
 economy helping us deal imbalances show up,
 rather suffer them. instance, instead
 accepting higher wage costs Boston, moving plants
 rural regions New England wage costs lower. That's
 mobility. lot bankers business Texas going
 places banking system stronger. That's mobility.
 There's lot going didn't used there.
 think may era intense competition several
 different respects. one, U.S. back. think
 industry waking beginning compete. Governor Angell spoke

 many serious competitors world economy

 one thing going tend impede advance inflation.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. HELLER. fully agree last remarks. think

 remark: data scratched indicate that,
 yes, [similar] episodes before. matter fact,

 exchange rate changes concerned. Germany
