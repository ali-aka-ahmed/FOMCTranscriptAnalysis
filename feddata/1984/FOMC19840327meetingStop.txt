 MR. KICHLINE. Well, don't view inconceivable

 struggled whole issue. technical
 reasons number could readily come 6 percent
 rather substantive reasons could come
 6 percent. personal view 6 percent good number.

 it's wrong--and I'm assuming interest rates don't decline
 environment perhaps rise bit--I think
 odds favor smaller number 6 percent.
 One example
 auto area production levels think sensible.
 GM closing several plants. moment way Commerce

 auto production declining substantially. That's technical reason
 shows numbers.

 So, feel comfortable 6 percent

 it.
 Maybe changed. say "The Committee seeks

 That's perfectly general statement.

 Well, that's implied already.
 something logically lacking leave second
 sentence. great desire leave second sentence in,
 raises question next sentence.
 MR. CORRIGAN. Could change parenthetical statement
 read "should take account of" rather "be consistent with"?

 says "initially reserve path associated ranges
 consistent with."
 Instead say "would take account of."
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. CORRIGAN. Well, I'm concerned way sentence

 We're saying that.
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, could leave word "reserve."
 could say "greater restraint would acceptable event"

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

 Every little bit symbolism counts.
