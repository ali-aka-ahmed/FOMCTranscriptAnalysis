 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Rice.
 
 MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, staff's revisions
 forecast 1985 seem usually sensitive dollar
 
 10/2/84
 
 exchange rate. know various possibilities
 also know difficulty assessing probabilities associated
 forecasting exchange rate.
 don't think many people
 would argue basic long-run strength economy
 threatened.
 don't know many people forecast recession
 1985.
 think central question us right is:

 going happen current quarter possibly next quarter?
 question whether economy going continue decelerate
 current level activity estimated third quarter
 whether it's going stabilize levels around third
 quarter whether it's going rebound projected staff.

 think scenario outlined staff fourth quarter
 plausible one certainly hope realized.
 realized, we'll pretty much Ed Boehne hoping for--that
 is, kind situation want.
 However, think recognize pay attention
 kinds factors Chairman pointed moment
 ago:
 evidence considerable weakness
 staff forecast based pretty wobbly foundations--primarily
 consumer behavior expected rebound consumer spending. Now,
 time investment spending also decelerating somewhat,
 rebound current quarter seems crucially [dependent]
 substantial rebound consumer spending. past experience,
 think found predicting consumer behavior short run
 quarterly basis hazardous business. words,
 seems highly possible that, light rapid
 deceleration we've seen last quarter, could carry
 forward low levels expansion.
 would expect positive
 rates growth, conceivably fairly low rates growth-marginally positive rates growth--and that, judgment, would
 desirable outcome. think opportunity
 forestall without risk threatening sustainable
 expansion.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, rather pleased

 don't really see risks

 think Commerce flash report 3.6

 expecting revised upward somewhat.
 Also, numbers
 I've seen September, District least, indicating
 rebound economy slowing summer.
 Speaking specifically District, seeing
 slowdown, areas strengths still outweighing
 weaknesses economy.
 So, would think, Mr. Chairman,
 risk rebound fourth quarter
 carry 1985.
 say risk think it's
 going terribly significant numbers probably
 lower.
 certainly don't see negative growth even zero

 think institutional problems certainly
