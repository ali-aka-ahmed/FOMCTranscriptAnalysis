 So, can't isolate
 whether factors working--the
 [unintelligible] working inventory cycle, example.
 also tended weaken money growth given level
 borrowing.
 Now, Committee allow operating
 procedures money supply weakens strengthens there's room
 judgmental adjustments borrowing. [a
 provision] automatic adjustment [current] period.
 actual judgmental adjustments borrowing occurred
 pretty much track almost 100 percent automaticity would
 given last month. nowhere near track
 100 percent automaticity would given, example, prior
 last month. So, automaticity--as period
 '79 '82--borrowing would lower well last
 month. light this, partly looking data
 various ways seems M1 nowhere near bad variable
 period '82 first half '83, make
 suggestion.
 actually somewhat like suggestion Mr.
 Sternlight made earlier year, greeted
 open arms Committee. suggestion permit certain
 degree automaticity level borrowing, M1 weaken.
 suggestion made [in paper] really rather moderate--a
 small-scale automaticity--because I'm assuming Committee
 would prefer continue essentially judgmental approach.

 within general approach, strikes possible let
 borrowing fall small amount M1 weak. suggestion
 [to limit automatic change borrowing perhaps] 25
 50 percent deviation M1 acceptable.
 would
 give [typical] deviation, think, order $35 $70
 $100 million. weeks would down; weeks would up.
 I'm suggesting permit kind variation lever
 top judgmental adjustment, persistent
 trend weakness M1 persistent weakness economy
 persistent movement exchange rate away considered
 desirable light Committee's overall objectives.
 addition, think another lesson drawn
 experience summer fall area judgmental
 adjustments.
 Traditionally, course, judgmental adjustments
 look interest rates, economy, overall credit conditions,
 similar things. happened recently, course,
 dollar remained high exchange markets longer
 people expected. international sector becoming
 important element changes GNP, seems present
 circumstances among judgmental factors might given

 So, would judge

 Finally, Mr. Chairman, discussed issue come
 many years--target basing. focused base M1

 question becomes whether base

 12/17-18/84
 
 range really unrandom shocks velocity probably
 compensated M1 movements.
 Further, course, noted
 Committee indicate--and done past--that
 may wish growth upper, middle, lower portion
 range adopt, depending views [a
 desirable] path coming years. So, option open.

 essence, paper tends somewhat negative question
 shifting base, largely practical grounds [relating
 difficulty] explanation.
 economic issue whether
 fact demand shift accounts 1 percentage point
 lower growth, tried remain somewhat agnostic. evidence
 says is.
 look quarterly model. think
 "within 1 percentage point" doesn't seem like good practical
 argument making growth 2, 3, 4 percentage points off.
 [major] institutional developments point to,
 think argument practical weight. don't think it's
 good practical argument you're 1 percentage point
 midpoint.
 seems bit like [unintelligible].
 MR. MARTIN. Steve, regard question rebasing:
 saying, absence new savings instruments
 institutional changes, select midpoint
 fourth quarter midpoint year something sort,
 based rather hypothetical level would tend
 locked to, effect, use procedure future?
 MR. AXILROD. No, don't think Committee ever locked
 in, think would explain rebased year
 earlier years may even bigger misses.
 then, course, would explain rebase next
 year.
 don't think locks time all.
 MR. WALLICH. would seem locks us in,

 But, let's face

 Basically, three people make

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES.
 would like speak favor degree
 automatic response, Steve set forth good case
 paper.
 fact, whole paper badly needed new look
 operating procedures sense general dissatisfaction
 many us--with benefit hindsight now--with second
 half turned terms money targets interest rate levels
 similar matters.
 would say, though, respect
 current operating procedure even amendment
 proposing, Steve, think we're still going subject
 weaknesses found way back 1960s respect
 free reserves. given level borrowing given level
 free reserves compatible wide range interest rates,
 wide range different economic outcomes, wide range
 possible growth monetary aggregates.
 That's
 experienced many years ago.
 I'm afraid we're still working
 tool built-in disadvantages.
 So, personally
 would favor going along sort semi-automatic route
 type Steve described, think also ought consider,
 alternative that, semi-automatic targeting nonborrowed
 reserves, closer we're really trying
 control--the monetary aggregates intermediate targets.

 don't need get back full automatic pilot. Even
 go back nonborrowed reserves targeting, could also introduce
 semi-automaticity simply making judgments degree
 nonborrowed reserve path would varied response
 deviation money path. I'm pretty much convinced point
 kind approach would superior longer run
 something hooked borrowing target.
 [The latter approach]
 recently, well many years ago, demonstrated kinds
 weaknesses concern many us.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, end close John Balles

 I'd like say first agree Steve
 done fine job memo and, might suspect,
 think right saying M1, despite imperfections,
 probably still best target.
 So, would favor tightening
 targeting procedures could nearly hit
 targets, leads favor, does, degree

 deviation required reserves path would pretty good place
 start.
 still entertain hopes someday we're going get

 believe ultimately that's best hope really

 I'd also like mention
