 question
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 projection inflation. projecting, said, 1
 percentage point higher inflation '85 compared '84.
 understood correctly analysis 6 weeks ago, projecting
 1 percentage point rise unit labor costs. Now, alone
 could account 1 point rise inflation top
 you're also factoring 10 15 percent reduction exchange
 rate, presumably you'll get increase utilization
 capacity. don't see how, based assumptions, end
 1 percentage point increase inflation '85 '84.
 MR. KICHLINE. unit labor costs rising 1984
 2-1/2 percent 1985 neighborhood
 4-3/4 percent.
 It's substantial rise, part
 compensation rising part smaller gains
 So, get substantial rise unit

 labor costs, level 1984 quite moderate.
 respect dollar, quite correct adverse
 time
 effects really show late year.
 One Ted keeps

 saying dollar forecast come 15 percent.

 thing don't talk level; level always
 higher short run.
 So, part we're dealing
 favorable prices dollar occurring early 1985; it's
 really late 1985 adverse [dollar] effect occurs.
 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. don't price effects show
 lot earlier trade effects?
 MR. TRUMAN. certainly show earlier, Jim
 certainly correct.
 [a dollar decline of] 15 percent
 fourth quarter year--which we're projecting--by
 fourth quarter next year would half price
 effects that. spread 15 percent decline
 next 5 quarters, you're really talking
 relatively small component price effects dollar
 [decline].
 fact, nominal import prices going 4
 quarters 1985 14 percent, even don't
 coming through, lags forth,
 projection period.
 MR. WALLICH. even dollar stays is, since
 rising time benefit inflation
 rise stops.
 MR. TRUMAN.
 
 That's Jim's point.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, wonder could follow
 similar question.
 generally agree staff
 forecast but, understand analysis correctly,
 revised growth forecast upward revised inflation
 number downward 1985, whereas unemployment rate associated
 unchanged. obviously several
 explanations this--the strength dollar, perhaps increased
 productivity, on.
 But, frankly, I'm little confused
 seems somewhat inconsistent forecast.
 enlighten me?
 MR. KICHLINE.
 First all, would say given
 margin error view real side forecast significantly
 different before.
 you're quite correct
 extent made changes 6-quarter period up-especially 1985, it's quarter point higher.

 inflation side, I'd mention several things.
 One important:
 food prices.
 Indeed, food price increase 5
 percent projected year next. range
 6-1/2 percent earlier 7-1/2 percent. That's big
 number terms overall price picture. think
 missed; may show later frankly we've held onto forecast
 making downward revisions along way. But, again, it's
 important. dollar talked about.

 so, I'd say, assumption oil prices

 So, taken optimistic view things.
