 mr. martin. steve, regard question rebas:

 mr. axilrod. no, don't think committe ever lock

 don't think lock time all.
 mr. wallich. would seem lock us in,
 sens we're accept path previou year, mai

 fact, whole paper badli need new look

 mani us--with benefit hindsight now--with second
 half turn term monei target interest rate level

 would sai, though, respect

 that's

 i'm afraid we're still work

 so, person
 would favor go along sort semi-automat rout
 type steve describ, think also ought consid,
 altern that, semi-automat target nonborrow

 control--the monetari aggreg intermedi target.

 don't need get back full automat pilot. even
 go back nonborrow reserv target, could also introduc
 semi-automat simpli make judgment degre
 nonborrow reserv path would vari respons
 deviat monei path. i'm pretti much convinc point

 [the latter approach]
 recent, well mani year ago, demonstr kind

 chairman volcker.
 
 mr. black.
 
 mr. black. mr. chairman, end close john ball

 i'd like sai first agre steve
 done fine job memo and, might suspect,
 think right sai m1, despit imperfect,

 so, would favor tighten

 deviat requir reserv path would pretti good place
 start.
 still entertain hope somedai we're go get
 total reserv target penalti discount rate,
 believ ultim that's best hope realli
 get point want go.
 i'd also like mention
