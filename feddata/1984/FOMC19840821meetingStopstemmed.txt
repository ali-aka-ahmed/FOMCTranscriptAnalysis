 mr. kichlin. unit labor cost rise 1984

 8/21/84
 
 sai dollar forecast come 15 percent.

 thing don't talk level; level alwai
 higher short run.
 so, part we're deal
 favor price dollar occur earli 1985; it's
 realli late 1985 advers [dollar] effect occur.
 vice chairman solomon. don't price effect show
 lot earlier trade effect?
 mr. truman. certainli show earlier, jim
 certainli correct.
 [a dollar declin of] 15 percent
 fourth quarter year--which we're project--by
 fourth quarter next year would half price
 effect that. spread 15 percent declin
 next 5 quarter, you're realli talk
 rel small compon price effect dollar
 [declin].
 fact, nomin import price go 4

 come through, lag forth,
 project period.
 mr. wallich. even dollar stai is, sinc
 rise time benefit inflat
 rise stop.
 mr. truman.
 
 that's jim's point.
 
 mr. forrest. mr. chairman, wonder could follow
 similar question.

 forecast but, understand analysi correctli,
 revis growth forecast upward revis inflat
 number downward 1985, wherea unemploy rate associ
 unchang. obvious sever
 explan thi--the strength dollar, perhap increas
 product, on.
 but, frankli, i'm littl confus
 seem somewhat inconsist forecast.
 enlighten me?
 mr. kichlin.
 first all, would sai given
 margin error view real side forecast significantli
 differ befor.
 you're quit correct
 extent made chang 6-quarter period up-especi 1985, it's quarter point higher.

 inflat side, i'd mention sever thing.
 on import:
 food price.
 inde, food price increas 5
 percent project year next. rang
 6-1/2 percent earlier 7-1/2 percent. that's big
 number term overal price pictur. think
 miss; mai show later frankli we've held onto forecast
 make downward revis along wai. but, again, it's
 import. dollar talk about.
 near term
 energi; gasolin price drop someth like

 season adjust 12 percent annual rate third quarter.
 lag ppi; haven't realli seen much ppi
