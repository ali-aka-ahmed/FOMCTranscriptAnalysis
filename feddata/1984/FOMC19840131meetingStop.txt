 Yes.

 MR. TRUMAN. Part point dollar's

 So, therefore,

 desirability restoring M1 one aggregates target-possibly going back old equal weight used M1
 M2.
 I'll brief reasons recommending
 haven't really changed since last fall circulated paper
 comparing performance M1 M2.
 briefly,
 perhaps over-simplified, conclusions drew demand
 M1 remained surprisingly stable recent period
 financial deregulation, whereas demand M2 matter fact
 become progressively unstable. It's true, course,
 respect M1 sharp unexpected decline--a
 surprising decline--in velocity '82 even early '83.
 analysis decline caused shift demand
 function M1 direct outcome decline inflation
 corresponding later decline interest rates.

 increase money demanded interest rates
 opportunity costs holding money lower. think
 significant piece evidence shift demand
 function money move along curve velocity
 [broader] monetary aggregates also declined 1982.
 don't
 think would happened problem solely one
 instability demand function M1.
 Another thing would like point
 variability M1 velocity Steve referred indirectly
 actually bit less variability M2 velocity. staff,
 using figures Steve's excellent memorandum January 23,
 compared standard deviations one another found
 standard deviations annual growth rates M1 actually
 little less case M2.
 it's well good
 proper point out, Steve done usual thorough way,
 residual problems remaining M1. good part
 consists Super accounts may interest elasticity.
 Looking
 hand, alternatives?
 alternatives, two things clearly stand me.
 One M2
 really lost meaningful relationship future income.
 say, M2 recent years grown steady 8 9 percent rate
 year whether strong, booming economy whether deep
 recession. never could anticipated either one two
 growth rates M2 preceded it.
 Though wouldn't put
 bets M1 means, think, given point Steve
 made velocity M1 seeming turned upward
 direction even moderately, sharp inflow funds
 Super NOWs tapered fairly stable slow growth
 rate there.
 So, would recommend restoring M1 equal weight
 would subscribe point Steve made
 going restore M1, probably consider reducing

 Thank you, Mr.

 following reasons, perhaps repetitious things
 said:
 revised money numbers imply M1 velocity
 stable previously believed; Bluebook
 suggests M1 velocity expected behave pretty normally
 throughout 1984; Axilrod memorandum John Balles referred
 also suggests M1 velocity expected behave normally

 velocity assumed predictable pattern and, indicated,
 think happened. Also, given implementation CRR

 controlling M1, ask rhetorical question, guess:
 Hasn't
 time arrived--now rather later--to place weight M1?
 said that, turn alternatives Bluebook
 would prefer. First, let say look setting

 setting targets obtainable reach

 pretty close alternative II, although said
 M1 would inclined reduce upper end M1

 I'm concerned

 would move range M2 6 9 percent rather 6-1/2

 think alternative II consistent
