 thing may occurred--and it's very,

 don't think much good; really reflect
 happened recently. may we've period low

 something could affect attitudes speed plans

 don't expect price increase whereas did.
 would point staff forecast nothing write
 home terms great strength. forecast little
 3 percent real growth next five quarters.
 That's
 high number.
 would also point important
 presumption forecast real imports go

 don't believe import surge ended,

 So, forecast little 3 percent assumes
 net imports stopped growing third quarter,
 already behind us.
 That's strong forecast.
 Henry speaks inflation. says base rate 5
