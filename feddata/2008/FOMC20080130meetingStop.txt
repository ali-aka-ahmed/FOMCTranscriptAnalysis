 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Brian, want ask projections.
 Well, exercise now—the projections offering real.

 think clearer time—from participants’ forecasts many participants characterized
 NAIRU vicinity 4¾ percent. Unfortunately, writeups time

 MR. PLOSSER. two questions would like pose. One change
 Greenbook’s assumption increase potential GDP. particular, curious
 essentially does, seems, build significant amount slack output

 reason more-aggressive easing policy assumption effect inflation

 also curious know, hadn’t done that, forecast growth inflation

 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. terms rationale increasing potential going back

 Now, one question would be, address second question, would things

 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. path gap would first approximation

 possibility adverse feedback loop economy credit markets.
 Reports firms mixed. Investment may slowed, reflecting uncertainty slower

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. question related Governor

 addition, captures number things talked about. One sort quick
 policy reversal potential things go well. question is, see
 path communications likely evolve? going look like? sound like

 Committee see think terms strategies rather sort one-off policy
 choices, thinking sequence actions like very, helpful. Governor
 Mishkin asked expectations noted backward-looking, wanted
 ask that. guys described us firms wage setters
 financial markets. forward-looking part financial markets,
 backward-looking well?
 MR. MADIGAN. financial markets forward-looking simulations.
 MR. LACKER. know, applied macroeconomics, range

 special episode economic dynamics called recession look back past recessions
 think sort forward-looking way. me, usual circumstances,
 heightens value thinking least exploring implications forwardlooking approach expectations. say particular thinking strategies
 get trials recessions. pretty rare, inferences set market
 participants going make recessions going influenced past recessions.
 going last chance influence perceptions behave next
 recession. really interested thinking strategy recession
 point view of, well, market participants expect us adopt strategy
 adopt this. would like see analysis says, “Well, right,
 strategy understood agents strategy,
 
 January 29–30, 2008
 
 110 249
 
 economy behave?” adopt strategy, one think sustain one
 would like choose future understood.
 Related that, Governor Mishkin mentioned inflation inflation expectations,
 little confused discussion yesterday always thought us wanting
 minimize distortion rate return money, suggests minimizing rawreturn gap nominal real securities. quite sure don’t care nearly
 much variance inflation risk premiums due inflation
 expected inflation. understanding guys think optimal monetary
 policy? know scenarios like that. mean, fluctuations variance
 inflation fit in?
 MR. MADIGAN. don’t think fit direct way. still lot work
 ahead us, despite progress made modeling recent years, consider
 things like distribution different economic outcomes skewness
 distributions, respect output respect inflation, would interact riskaversion monetary policymaking. don’t think science quite gotten stage yet,
 agree worthwhile things study further.
 MR. LACKER. One thought discussion expected inflation, noted
 one-to-five-year rise inflation hadn’t affected much, five-to-ten-year rise
 had. well understood agents going something like recession,
 comes around every while, maybe ratifying current inflation bringing
 down. might expect inference would change inflation behaves
 next recession, would come five ten years now. Wouldn’t it?
 
 January 29–30, 2008
 
 111 249
 
 MR. MADIGAN. see point making, sounds plausible. know,
 again, thought that, investors concerned monetary policy makers
 making inflationary mistake, would begin affect inflation near term, meaning
 within several years rather seven eight years ahead.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. technical question inflation expectations.

 take risk-management approach respond bit usual. then, things

 recession doesn’t emerge, say, “Oh, easing wasn’t expected,”
 becomes critical long hold it. hold get rid gradually,
 inflation expectations start shift up. think Fed’s inflation goal changed.

 MR. LACKER. Okay. case risk-management

 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. No, don’t know likely reverse course

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. “castle sand” quality
 discussion. Let make three points took see got right. One
 is, staff’s judgment, 3 percent—in view world, way
 discussion yesterday—policy providing degree insurance
 accommodation adverse outcomes may ahead.
 second thing took away framework seems like good way thinking
 think moving lower, think mistake we’re going
 make want make. going make mistake, good think
 
 January 29–30, 2008
 
 113 249
 
 mistake costly mistake easier correct. seems tells us almost
 nothing, frankly, going position going want start
 take back. also probably tells us little quickly going want
 take back. would thought remarkable thing paths little
 difference variance outcomes year out. mean, must far within
 range uncertainty context, us start thinking design
 optimal exit communicate it, President Evans’s reasons many others,
 basic humility, seems kind premature. lot sympathy fact
 want make sure choosing error going make. lot
 sympathy thinking correct error. us assert,
 worried implications that, going start focusing design
 exit, sounds bit like statement obvious. course going move
 alacrity take back make sure inflation expectations stay anchored reasonable
 level. course are. suggest otherwise assert would look kind insecure—a
 lack confidence do.
 third thing took away seems say that, make policy
 way consistent response Committee past decade half so,
 pretty good outcomes strategy take enough risk
 downside error. Now, life could uncertain. Maybe charitable past,
 seems kind reassuring way.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think hard generalize. say
 recessions, specific communication undertaken—for example, last
 episode actually communication leaned rapid reversal—you know,

 MR. MISHKIN. Yes. want make comment President Geithner said

 following President Plosser’s suggestion, substitute wording last sentence
 December 11 statement wording last line alternative B. is, could substitute
 words “will act needed foster price stability sustainable economic growth”
 words “will act timely manner needed address risks.” seems
 small change would, taken together new first sentence paragraph 4, slightly dial

 credit markets real economy.
 Now, let make couple fairly general comments. I’m much view
 natural state U.S. economy full employment output growth potential. That’s
 economy tends gravitate, firms markets respond relatively quickly whole
 shocks. particularly good example shock September 11. following three
 months, companies shed million jobs nonfarm payrolls, responded pretty quickly,
 slashed production inventories, fact, shock ended creating case
 labeled recession. Without that, don’t think would labeled recession.
 Anyway, shock last August lead sharp retrenchment real economy. Putting
 housing aside now, aggravated housing problem already way. Firms
 markets making many necessary adjustments. Housing starts down. House prices

 Another point, commentary, that, taking action along lines alternative
 B, would nice weren’t going lowering value implied markets

 I’m open possibility simply changing last sentence go back December 11. Now,

 MR. LACKER. characterized underwriting weak, guess document
 circulated heavy criticism credit rating agencies. want understand
 nature assessment involves. Basically ex post regret, objective
 evidence quality decisionmaking ex ante? evidence, course, would involve
 assessments probability placed things saw.
 MR. PARKINSON. Mike going address briefing. guess I’d prefer delay
 simply say think point aspects methodology look fairly weak
 wasn’t simply ex post result one foreseen least degree
 stronger methodology ex ante. Obviously that’s Monday morning quarterbacking,
 still point specific things weaknesses.
 MR. LACKER. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.

 MR. POOLE. question exhibit 2, top right corner: AAA
 examples rated January 1?
 MR. PARKINSON. think rating origination.
 MR. POOLE. origination, afterward. Okay. question really
 comment. exhibit 1, middle panel, seems something needs explored here,
 given first time banks made lot bad bets, way
 management incentives designed. get impression—and stuff
 paper recently, Wall Street Journal somewhere—that lot people really given
 incentives push products make deals. walk away big bonuses,
 heck cares happens time later. think management incentives
 something important investigate order idea works, might
 assistance designing something would helpful here.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Yes. exhibit 4 risk-based capital ratios, fourth quarter,
 December 31?
 MR. PARKINSON. Yes.
 MR. HOENIG. Okay. reflect losses already taken capital rates?
 MR. PARKINSON. Yes. reflect developments terms changes
 financial statements fourth quarter year-end.
 MR. HOENIG. Okay. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. question, President Yellen?
 MS. YELLEN. wanted support President Poole’s comment. remember well back
 Jackson Hole 2005 Raghuram Rajan presented paper emphasized

 misalignment incentives investors managers fact almost everyone
 line right investors incentives here. don’t know
 thinking, everybody rewarded quantity quality originations.
 warned us happened could come good, think
 suggestions compensation practices. popular suggestions. think
 worth thought. don’t know answer terms changing practices.
 Maybe market attend them, seems awful lot booms
 busts type incentive played role. presentation paper started
 fact note deterioration underwriting, go one step backward.
 suppose another issue saw supervision whether acted appropriately
 given saw. raises number issues won’t go moment
 think need sensitive to.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren.
 MR. ROSENGREN. question exhibit 4, bottom two panels. four
 banks there, look capital ratios, doesn’t look discouraging.
 look credit default swaps, looks little less encouraging. put Wachovia this,
 believe Wachovia’s credit default swaps 166, would much higher
 scale right now. would interesting actually add Wachovia list. second
 thing take fact capital ratios don’t look bad credit default
 swaps markets looking indicate that, past month half, people—
 despite capital infusions—are actually exhibiting concern default experiences
 might occur.
 
 January 29–30, 2008
 
 165 249
 
 MR. PARKINSON. Right. Well, particularly respect developments last
 month two, obviously economic outlook cloudier. know, don’t think try
 reflect fully capital ratios, element stress testing whatnot,
 important effects essentially looking cycle. may part it. Also,
 look credit default swap spread behavior compared lots financial
 intermediaries there, look like modest changes. don’t know—if Mike someone
 could help out—to extent would translate significant increases actual implied
 default probabilities, wouldn’t think would large increase.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you. agree President Poole President
 Yellen need focus compensation structures incentives, two observations.
 One that, look compensation practices among guys actually look though
 pretty well didn’t well—I’m talking mortgage-origination
 sense major global financial institutions—the structure compensation doesn’t vary
 much. varies lot well people control inherent problems basic
 compensation structures. Remember Raghu’s presentation mostly hedge fund
 compensation, think mostly wrong think incentive structure.
 difference really design limits make sure traders’ incentives
 aligned incentives firm whole. biggest errors differences
 design process checks balances compensate inherent problems
 compensation structure. That’s important know lot things, look
 formal attributes risk-management governance structure across firms, don’t look
 different. distinguishes well guys much subtle around culture,
 
 January 29–30, 2008
 
 166 249
 
 independence, quality judgment exercised senior level, important
 because, think supervision regulation, affect
 stuff hard.
 question Pat. Pat, overdo this, put diagnosis
 contributing factors constellation financial conditions prevailed boom
 housing prices? know, there’s tendency everybody look regulation
 supervision incentives created failed mitigate,
 reasonable view world wouldn’t pattern underwriting standards
 mortgages without trajectory house prices occurred. Sure, maybe happened
 late stage mortgage-origination process contributed upside, look chart,
 rate house-price appreciation started decelerate time worst erosion
 underwriting practices. Anyway, basic question is, put constellation
 financial conditions, much Fed happening globally
 affected long rates, expectations future rates, et cetera?
 MR. PARKINSON. Well, partly would say, general, pricing risk
 many, many people, including people Federal Reserve, concerned
 narrow spreads were, concerned slippage practices, predicting
 trouble lay ahead. But—and I’m certainly speaking myself—I never expected
 magnitude trouble. I’ve focusing factors essentially made
 bad situation much worse expected be. question entered
 period risk priced cheaply fundamental reassessment risk. Again, think
 shouldn’t surprised anyone, almost everyone except extreme pessimists
 surprised much trouble repricing risk caused. things

 focused certainly anticipated, think made situation markedly
 worse expected be.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions Pat? Okay. continue
 presentation.
 MR. GIBSON. noted top left panel exhibit 5, would like stress
 two key points rating agency investor issues. First, credit rating agencies
 one weak links helped relatively small shock subprime
 mortgage market spread widely, though certainly one.
 staff working group’s view—most market participants also expressed
 opinion rating agencies deserve blame. Second, way
 investors use ratings risk management kept financial
 innovations, growth structured finance. financial innovations
 made credit rating less reliable sufficient statistic risk. top right
 panel provides roadmap presentation. start, I’ll expand
 points Pat made role rating agencies financial crisis. aim
 show credit rating agencies weak link, lead naturally
 recommendations rating agency practices. go, I’ll point several places
 rating agency issues link investor practices issues you’ll
 hear next Bev. feel strongly ratings investor issues
 really two angles underlying issue.
 crisis began subprime market, subject next panel.
 subprime mess happened—and keeps getting worse—in part issues
 associated rating agencies (though said earlier, plenty blame go
 around). staff working group asked whether rating agencies got wrong
 rated subprime RMBS. answer “yes”—they got wrong. Rating
 agencies badly underestimated risk subprime RMBS. Last year, Moody’s
 downgraded 35 percent first-lien subprime RMBS issued 2006. average
 size subprime RMBS downgrades two broad rating categories—for
 example, downgrade BB—compared historical average
 downgrade 1⅓ broad rating categories. indicated exhibit, rating
 methodologies subprime flawed rating agencies relied much
 historical data several points analysis. First, rating agencies
 underestimated severe housing downturn could become. Second, rating
 agencies underestimated poorly subprime loans would perform house
 prices fell relied historical data contain periods
 falling house prices. Third, subprime market changed time, making
 originator matter performance subprime loans, rating agencies
 factor identity originator ratings. Fourth, rating agencies
 consider risk refinancing opportunities would probably dry
 whatever stress event seriously threatened subprime market. course, rating
 agencies alone this. Many others misjudged risks well.

 rating agencies. conflicts interest rating agencies certainly exist,
 rating paid issuer, didn’t see evidence conflicts
 affected ratings. said, also cannot say conflicts factor.
 SEC currently examinations way rating agencies gather
 detailed information needed check whether conflicts significant effect.
 next panel, turn ABS CDOs invested heavily subprime.
 Rating agencies got wrong ABS CDOs. downgrade rate ABS CDOs
 2007 worse previous historical worst case, subprime.
 AAA tranches ABS CDOs turned remarkably vulnerable: Last year,
 twenty-seven AAA tranches downgraded way AAA
 investment grade. indicated exhibit, main reason rating agencies
 got wrong ABS CDOs rating models crude. Rating
 agencies used corporate CDO models rate ABS CDOs. data
 estimate correlation defaults across asset-backed securities. Despite many
 flaws credit ratings sufficient statistic credit risk, rating agencies used
 ratings main measure quality subprime RMBS ABS CDOs
 invested in. rating agencies limited, ad hoc analysis
 timing cash flows affects risk ABS CDO tranches. result, ratings
 ABS CDOs viewed highly uncertain. one risk manager put it,
 ABS CDOs “model risk squared.” final point ABS CDOs
 market’s reaction poor performance ABS CDOs makes clear
 investors understand differences corporate structured-finance
 ratings. structured-finance securities built diversified portfolios,
 systematic risk less idiosyncratic risk corporate securities.
 naturally sensitive macroeconomic risk factors like house prices,
 design, downgrades structured-finance securities correlated
 larger downgrades corporate bonds.
 Turning bottom panel, Pat noted, August last year subprime
 shock hit ABCP markets, especially markets ABCP issued SIVs. Rating
 agencies also got wrong SIVs. two-thirds SIVs’
 commercial paper downgraded defaulted. problem
 ratings rating agencies’ models SIVs relied rapid liquidation
 SIVs’ assets shield SIVs’ senior debt losses. might
 worked single SIV got trouble, market would able
 absorb rapid liquidation SIVs time. investors began
 understand rating model SIVs, even SIVs subprime exposure could
 roll commercial paper. Investors thought taking
 credit risk became uncomfortable market risk liquidity risk
 inherent SIV’s business model.
