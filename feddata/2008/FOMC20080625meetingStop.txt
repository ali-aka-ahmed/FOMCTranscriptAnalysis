 June 24, 2008—Afternoon Session
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody. don’t begin, usual,
 Desk report Bill Dudley. Bill.
 MR. DUDLEY. 1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m going referring
 handout front you. Financial markets become
 resilient bad news recent weeks. Although news associated several
 important groups financial intermediaries—including investment banks,
 commercial banks, monoline insurers—has favorable, contagion
 limited compared earlier experiences past year.
 Moreover, types vicious feedback loops evident, example, early
 March largely absent recently.
 Despite this, much news good. Looking first U.S.
 equity credit markets, good portion improvement occurred
 run-up April FOMC meeting unwound recently. broad U.S.
 equity indexes marginally low points reached mid-March

 financing lines Lehman place. investment banks begun rapidly
 deleverage balance sheets. shown exhibit 6, gross leverage ratios
 Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley fell sharply second
 quarter. stands marked contrast rise leverage ratios persisted
 first quarter year.
 Regional banks also come considerable strain recently. Deterioration
 construction lending, commercial real estate, residential mortgage books
 caused many banks raise loan-loss provisions sharply. Potential acquirers
 troubled regional banks discouraged accounting requirement
 banks must mark assets bank they’re acquiring
 current market value time acquisition.
 financial guarantors also stress. Standard & Poor’s
 Moody’s recently downgraded Ambac MBIA. Moody’s downgrade
 MBIA particularly sharp—five notches A2 AAA. downgrades
 monoline guarantors number important implications. First, firms
 purchased protection Ambac MBIA take significant
 write-downs. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, UBS appear largest
 exposures two firms. Second, ability Ambac MBIA establish
 new AAA-rated subsidiaries would enable write new municipal bond
 insurance increasingly doubt. likely, firms forced go
 runoff mode longer write new business. Third, financial
 resources firms strained downgrades. example, MBIA said
 that, result downgrades, may pay $2.9 billion satisfy
 certain contracts post $4.5 billion additional collateral. Fourth, risk

 unsettle CDS market. shown exhibits 7 8, share prices
 monolines continued slide, credit default swap spreads risen
 further. case time, remains—even credit

 Despite rating downgrades, effect municipal securities market

 Demand term securities lending facility (TSLF) auctions also generally

 Following first TSLF auction, Treasury repo rates rose sharply. Given

 Greenbook suggests, real economy proved resilient dynamic consensus

 Second, let talk financial markets. Financial markets continue show tenuous
 real improvements market functioning—which, Bill Dudley suggested, remarkable
 given weakness among financial institutions themselves. Leveraged loans high-yield
 markets continue trend toward improved market functioning. Credit spreads well

 Given discussions we’ve had, think may difficult pursue something like

 action would move us beyond merely talking inflationary risk would help us contain

 assuming that’s majority view today, would encourage us set stage

 Finally, let say think policy currently accommodative, perhaps

 weak. don’t dispute that. data since last meeting better expected.
 Greenbook forecasts well private-sector forecasts revised up. although
 downside risks remain, tail risk significant recession-like outcome economy, though
 vanished, certainly diminished. Second, financial market indicators suggest
 market functioning, though back normal, certainly improved somewhat recent months.
 Demand Fed liquidity primary dealers fallen. Primary credit borrowing generally

 Expectations various kinds elevated. Upside risk core inflation increased,
 Greenbook said. said yesterday, upside risks stem potential passthrough energy prices also, view, fact we’re running
 accommodative policy despite rising inflation.
 fact, believe policy actually become accommodative since meeting

 inflation risen. So, fact, real funds rate actually declined since last meeting

 MR. PLOSSER. Governor Kohn, question, comment, interest rates. lot
 discussion centered accommodative think policy interpret
 current environment. want quantify magnitude bit, least way think
 it, even believe economy weak enough appropriate equilibrium real rate

 nominal funds rate 3 percent opposed 2 percent. roughly speaking, would
 interpret say roughly 100 basis points extra accommodation built fed
 funds rate relative what—and that’s assuming equilibrium real rate zero, might even
 low. I’m thinking way, could clarify quantify
 way?
 MR. KOHN. It’s difficult. don’t know inflation expectations are. We’re
 using proxies, came forth strongly Cape Cod conference were,
 President Plosser. don’t even understand well expectations formed, think
 we’re looking people perceive cost capital finance purchases. we’re
 wondering whether low interest rate causing bring purchases forward future
 present induce buy things, capital goods, right? That’s interest rate we’re really
 looking at—the perceived cost credit folks—and I’m sure subtracting rate

 right now. cost credit automobiles perceived hugely high reasons perhaps
 aren’t related monetary policy. don’t think see surge purchases capital equipment
 would suggest businesses perceive cost credit negative. think,
 don’t understand inflation expectations can’t measure them, look
 lot different things around edges confirm people perceive real rate be.
 don’t see lot information suggests people perceive real rate negative
 influencing manage purchases goods services time.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. guess say simply, rates
 determined behavior—for example, mortgage rates, auto rates, corporate bond rates—are
 higher year ago. Now, unless major change long-term inflation
 expectations, TIPS data don’t suggest, don’t seem indications, far interest
 rates relevant people’s spending decisions, significant reduction.
 Someone else comment. Governor Kroszner.

 Tail risks risen inflation. question it. take

 making comparison tail risks tail risks, still think inflation tail risks

 important indicators—such wages, inflation expectations, core inflation—have yet

 President Fisher President Stern talked rhetorical aspects policy

 nothing unless eventually backed actions. hand, actions may

 anyone thoughts word? concerns? President Lacker?
 MR. LACKER. thought Vice Chairman Geithner’s characterization markets
 pretty good, compatible suggestion.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Given suggested removing word “considerable,” purpose

 primarily, exclusively, four investment banks focus there.
 I’ll say words extent usage section 13 facilities. Again,
 PDCF primarily focus, sake completeness, I’ll also discuss

 two key objectives. first ability exercise informed judgment
 capital liquidity positions primary dealers access PDCF.
 Second important, we’re aiming to, shorthand, mitigate moral
 hazard accompanies creation PDCF particular. make
 sure PDCF undermine incentives primary dealers
 firms manage capital liquidity conservatively.
 page 4, terms approach, focus firms primary
 dealers affiliated financial holding companies. That’s primarily,
 exclusively, four largest investment banks. I’ll touch end
 presentation several primary dealers we’ve interactions
 late. effort include on-site presence, limited examiners
 four largest investment banks. also small off-site staff,
 includes staff members Research Group, Markets Group, Legal
 Group, Bank Supervision. direct contact management
 firms. obtaining information directly firms well SEC,
 course, communicating coordinating closely SEC. It’s
 important point out, however, we’re engaged traditional bank
 supervision. scope fairly narrow. We’re conducting examinations,
 we’re providing issuing examination reports back firms. Therefore,
 making assessments, would say, without normal range normal
 complement supervisory protections we’re accustomed to. frank,
 carries risk vulnerability us. I’ll touch end
 presentation well. current focus limited narrowly focused capital,
 well liquidity, I’ll get moment. let’s turn page 5.
 Page 5 gives us view leverage four investment banks. note
 may bit confusing first glance. Leverage typically expressed
 multiple. We’ve converted ratios bank supervisors tend look
 ratios. bear mind. Investment bank leverage tend cyclical.
 graph picks really latter half last cycle, orally give
 perspective. graph moved back left, approximately 1999 2001
 would seen investment banks deleveraging response Russian
 default LTCM crisis third quarter 1998. would see leverage
 coming 2001. 2001-02, leverage essentially flat,
 graph picks increasing leverage 2004 end 2007.
 see, 2007 marked cyclical low point ratio, high point leverage
 multiple. Since then, firms deleveraging. Right
 clustering around 4 percent, trajectory, hope, still up, may
 something say that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Art, could define “leverage” picture.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 140 253
 
 MR. ANGULO. gross leverage, equity—in case, ratio
 equity total assets—a blunt measure.
 Page 6 gives us current view. left-hand panel tier 1 capital
 ratio four largest securities firms. think know, SEC made
 decision use hold investment banks Basel II ratio that’s consistent
 bank supervisors apply it. date, firms disclosed ratios.
 begins quarter, second quarter. Goldman, Lehman, Morgan
 Stanley, quarter ended May 31, 2008, show estimated ratios there.
 earnings releases, although picked
 analysts conference calls—so numbers seeping there.
 Merrill reports bank cycle, June 30, yet released tier 1
 capital ratio.
 couple takeaways left side page: First, quarter
 ended, Merrill obviously low compared peers.
 benefit seeing aware peers come out, shall see
 Merrill takes action near term bolster capital. second point
 investment bank ratios look fairly high compared commercial
 bank tier 1 capital ratio would be. couple reasons that. First,
 assets investment banks concentrated trading book, two
 issues there. assets tend lower credit charge. issue,
 work on, need understand better modeling
 methodologies model approvals SEC given firms
 compute tier 1 capital. could significant factor well. first blush
 look healthy, high; think take analysis get beneath
 those.
 right-hand side page 6 gives another way looking capital—what
 call “FRBNY-adjusted leverage ratio.” we’re trying
 another way putting investment banks commercial banks somewhat
 similar footing. terms numerator, use tangible equity two reasons.
 First, it’s higher form equity capital, perhaps highest form. Second
 important, avoids current differences investment banks
 commercial banks calculate tier 1 capital. Right there’s grandfathering period
 securities firms allowed carry higher portion subordinated
 debt tier 1 capital. apply bank holding companies. puts
 equivalent basis terms numerator. deal
 denominator. Again, we’re trying make allowances differences business
 models. subtract denominator secured financing assets.
 reverse repos securities borrowings. course, collateralized
 cash thus relatively low-risk assets. making two adjustments,
 somewhat comparable view. takeaway don’t look far
 apart—they dissimilar—at least point cycle.

 don’t move page 7, liquidity? picture liquidity,
 full picture. shows trend parent company liquidity pools.
 unencumbered cash high-quality securities parent company four
 investment banks. see, trend increasing since middle
 March. general trend increase. This, course, tells us half
 story one wants know pool held against. So, let’s turn page
 8, talk bit we’re trying look assess this.
 We’ve engaged SEC entered approach trying
 assess liquidity four investment banks. first started endeavor
 back late March, first thing go back firms say,
 “Show us would happen liquidity experienced Bear Stearns, full-run
 kind scenario? exercise want know assets eligible
 PDCF. want know bad dark would get.” exercise
 pretty demanding. one would passed test. looked
 asked whether full run institution appropriate way look
 appropriate standard hold to. came another scenario
 put back firms. basically said, “Listen, want stress analysis
 us. Look something that’s pretty severe short full Bear Stearns
 scenario. Look thirty days. way, access PDCF.
 Let’s see looks.” We’re process right now. table
 left gives idea things we’re looking we’ve
 asked firms provide information us. Basically several buckets:
 (1) unsecured secured funding; (2) comes balance sheet
 stress, either general market stress firm-specific stress; (3) impact
 operating cash flows toward bottom. combination liquidity
 claims would face stress. last piece additional funding
 affiliated unaffiliated bank lines along with, obviously, liquidity pool,
 separately. Basically, we’re engaged exercise compare
 converge assumptions. We’ve multiple discussions four
 firms, trying understand assumption differed trying converge
 those. constructed, process constructing, cash flow
 analysis. Again, relating cash needs stress, given
 assumptions, available liquidity pool plus unaffiliated affiliated bank
 lines drawn.
 drivers here, obviously, going mix term secured funding,
 going big driver terms liquidity needs, well
 operating cash flow assumptions firms make looking stress scenario.
 fairly close pulling together information construct
 analysis, go back firms, share assessments are,
 give chance explain us spot may
 missed certain things. conversations happen near future.
 that’s basically we’re terms liquidity. interesting
 exercise. think simple way look liquidity
 best way so.

 Let’s turn page 9. words use PDCF
 TSLF. graphs later TSLF. graph PDCF usage would
 kind boring. would show Bear Stearns far away dominant borrower.
 Actually think Bill Dudley conveyed yesterday Monday last
 night borrowing PDCF. Bear Stearns out. recently
 three others I’ll call chronic users PDCF. First, Cantor.
 I’ll say words that. started borrowing late March, initially
 $600 million $700 million. stabilized mid-April $500 million.
 saw borrowing coming every night. Members team spent one
 afternoon Cantor end April. asked information

 PDCF. would allow go closing, July 2, could transfer
 positions. return got little extra margin. So, effect, borrowings
 collateralized margin roughly 7 percent. got additional
 13 percent, bringing us 20 percent, bring us July 2.
 think sides reasonably comfortable there, friendly persuasion, Dudley
 Baxter sealed deal there.
 Let say words Barclays Capital. handled bit
 informally. started using PDCF late March, around $5 billion.
 got peak $7 billion. Bank Supervision Markets

 conversations Barclays, asking tell us little
 using this. What’s rationale? consistent story. would tell us
 economically advantageous use that. thought
 good. one conversation colleagues Markets Group, one
 traders conveyed Barclays thought needed support TSLF much
 way supported open market operations. colleagues Markets
 quickly disabused notion. couple conversations, got
 message. eventually ceased borrowing PDCF around
 beginning June. now, outstanding Countrywide
 Securities, come close next week, knock wood.
 sake completeness, page 10 I’ll talk TSLF
 usage. First, schedule 1, OMO-eligible collateral—as see among
 primary dealers, Merrill highest amount outstanding. Merrill is,
 guess, tan line. biggest users commercial banks—Deutsche
 Bank top, pretty consistent user. Citigroup (the green line),
 also fairly consistent heavy user. Let’s turn schedule 2 (page 11),
 less liquid collateral. among primary dealers, Lehman (the blue
 line) consistent user, followed Merrill Lynch. see,
 UBS among banks clearly far away biggest user, although within
 past two weeks reduced TSLF borrowings. that’s, briefly,
 top five. There’s bit mix here. see, investment banks
 biggest users TSLF.
 Let’s turn page 12, I’ll finish here. I’ll highlight near-term
 challenge face, think provide nice transition Scott’s Pat’s
 portions briefing. don’t want get much sections. think
 generally issue. think that, longer stay site effort,
 reputational risk Federal Reserve increases. Governor Kohn testified last
 week, we’re examining; narrowly focused. think message
 well received. time, it’s problematic. someone
 Hill six months year now, think it’s going difficult say
 we’re liquidity capital thing. People going want know
 little judgments made judgments. said early
 on, think there’s risk making judgments without little
 information. think trick us is, traditional bank supervision
 model left we’re right right, move
 way, left. means way here. think
 figure get way little more. that, end remarks
 pass Scott Pat.
 MR. ALVAREZ. Well, tell Art’s presentation, there’s
 significant amount information-sharing collaboration already
 Federal Reserve SEC. we’ve taken opportunity simultaneously
 what’s going primary dealers fashion document lay
 framework information-sharing collaboration go forward.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 144 253
 
 We’ve made pretty good progress document, we’re still negotiating.
 fact, Chairman negotiating afternoon Chairman Cox. one
 principals intimately involved.
 agreement currently structured really two parts. first part
 outlines plans sharing information two agencies. would divide
 world two pieces. consolidated supervised entities (CSEs),
 four large investment banks—Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
 Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch. agreed share information
 analysis financial condition, risk management, internal controls, capital,
 liquidity, funding resources firms. agreement focused primarily
 areas—so financial condition, liquidity, risk management
 firms. know, accessed information companies
 connection providing liquidity PDCF TSLF, we’ll
 share SEC. Similarly, SEC, primary regulator
 access much information, share information us.
 We’ve also agreed share information analysis various financial markets
 companies intimately involved in—in particular, tri-party repo market
 interbank lending market.
 Now, two bank holding companies participate SEC’s CSE program—
 Citigroup JPMorgan Chase. agreed share SEC type
 financial risk-management information regarding two firms
 extent information affects broker-dealers controlled
 two firms. expecting, SEC expecting us, share information
 relates condition bank condition nonbank portions
 either two firms—just part related broker-dealer.
 interest Federal Reserve financial condition
 broker-dealers CSE program. would broker-dealer
 that’s bank holding company regulated Federal Reserve. plan
 include information-sharing arrangement regarding institutions well.
 broadly, SEC would provide us information ongoing basis
 financial condition risk management, internal controls, capital,
 liquidity, funding resources broker-dealers controlled bank
 holding company. would allow us access beyond we’re currently getting.
 Right we’re getting primarily FOCUS reports broker-dealers,
 always informative documents. we’ll get access. also
 expecting agree provide similar kinds financial risk-management
 information SEC, extent information affects brokerdealer. would routinely providing information bank holding
 companies related bank related nonbanking operations
 broker-dealers. also expecting include provision outlines several
 existing agreements sharing information regarding
 clearing companies—DTC particular—transfer agents, municipal securities

 dealers, investment advisers. would simply incorporate, without changing,
 arrangements already have. essential part sharing information
 agencies would agree keep information confidential. addition,
 SEC agreeing use exam supervisory information, particular
 opinions might have, enforcement actions investigations without
 permission Federal Reserve.
 second part agreement, we’re working it, relates
 supervisory expectations four large investment banks primary
 dealers access PDCF TSLF. current proposal
 two agencies would agree collaborate coordinate

 management, funding CSEs primary dealers. We’d also

 tied specifically PDCF TSLF intended last beyond
 access facilities. also change legal authority either
 two agencies has. continue full, unfettered legal authority bank
 holding companies. continue full, unfettered authority brokerdealers. agree talk more, collaborate more, coordinate more.
 mentioned, MOU substantially worked out. still, though, negotiation
 couple key points. goal done week, hope
 announcement end week sometime next week. expect
 terms MOU made public. soon something that’s
 concrete enough, we’ll also send around you.
 MR. PARKINSON. Thanks. I’m going go last pages
 handout have, pages 13 15. Page 13 table reminding
 primary dealers providing basic information size,
 borrowing activity, regulatory status. probably know, currently
 20 primary dealers, although Art mentioned we’re lose two them—Bear
 Stearns Countrywide. important point note, ran Scott’s
 presentation, although investment banks—the four firms subject
 consolidated supervision SEC CSE program—are among
 largest primary dealers, large bank-affiliated dealers, including
 affiliates U.S. banks also affiliates German, Swiss, British,
 French banks. Also, look column 3, you’ll see—and data
 get two government securities clearing banks facilitate tri-party repo,
 JPMorgan Chase Bank New York—that shows investment banks
 not, fact, largest borrowers tri-party repo markets. Rather distinction

 regimes differ appreciably. OTS regime Countrywide, guess
 notable example itself, quite different one would apply.
 facts mind, turn next two pages. don’t intend go
 questions, we’ve done set issues
 discussion. Basically two sets, one relating future liquidity
 facilities primary dealers relating supervisory
 arrangements we’re seeking mitigate moral hazard
 liquidity facilities create. case, questions
 current laws, time Congress may change laws.
 questions legislative changes might seek, particularly Congress
 shows inclination legislate area. purpose list questions
 stimulate discussion among important issues provide
 opportunity express preliminary views may have. that,
 think we’d pleased answer questions three staff presentations.
 Thanks.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Questions colleagues? President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you. Thank you, Art, Scott, Patrick, forthcoming
 presentation. Two things you, Art: First, page 8 presented information
 details stress test you’re applying, table lists various unsecured funding
 secured funding sources, numerical assumptions severity stress.
 take apply balance sheet numbers calculations calculate
 stress test.
 MR. ANGULO. Correct. went back firms asked give us
 information cut way it’s readily available public information
 have. also asked give us, severe test scenario, assumption was.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 147 253
 
 Based submissions got four, converged massaged, came
 pretty close assumptions. didn’t make up.
 MR. LACKER. going say essentially asked question,
 “severe” mean stress system?
 MR. ANGULO. left somewhat hands, saying it’s going short
 full run.
 MR. LACKER. iteration get agreed-upon set numbers
 these.
 MR. ANGULO. Yes.
 MR. LACKER. Okay. Now, also said started first iteration asking
 give results Bear Stearns failure scenario. numbers correspond
 table?
 MR. ANGULO. would lot higher numbers secured funding. would
 numbers coming much closer illiquid, 100 percent, would a—
 MR. LACKER. Well, wait. I’m sorry. lost there.
 MR. ANGULO. fixed-income finance, example, secured funding,
 there’s liquid less liquid. 20 percent 50 percent. would
 approaching 100 percent.
 MR. LACKER. severity, that’s much money goes away.
 MR. ANGULO. much runs—exactly.
 MR. LACKER. Okay. numbers Bear—what actually
 experienced?
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 148 253
 
 MR. ANGULO. SEC working post mortem. promised share
 us they’re done. folks—I wouldn’t say forensic accountants—in
 looking that, trying piece together happened. exact numbers.
 MR. LACKER. didn’t exact numbers.
 MR. ANGULO. No.
 MR. LACKER. knew roughly were.
 MR. ANGULO. Things moved pretty quickly end.
 MR. LACKER. see. Well, interested information exactly
 transpired. there’s chance could share us information get it,
 would useful. second question you: noted reputational risk
 supervisory basis, want probe think that. eventualities would
 risky us?
 MR. ANGULO. guess couple. We’re saying we’re looking capital position.
 think Governor Kohn careful say testimony we’re looking capital relation
 near-term earnings prospects. gives us kind short window, know examining
 banks capital number that’s reported depends you’re carrying assets.
 done work trying get behind, example, evaluations Lehman’s
 commercial real estate portfolio. That’s potential vulnerability there. Also, really
 looked consolidated assessment risk management firms, something
 bank supervision process. we’re basically taking inputs, lack better word, face
 value work try validate those. That’s referring terms
 risk us. think long we’re there, people expect us little
 we’ve date.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 149 253
 
 MR. LACKER. it’s essentially risk that, fact, marks questioned,
 ask, “You guys there—why didn’t . . .?” understand that. Thanks.
 third question Pat. talked repo market. understanding
 supervisory work LFI (large financial institution) umbrella aimed conditions
 repo market mitigating risk there. mentioned obviously important
 factor Bear. extent think paying interest demand deposits would obviate
 need huge volume transactions repo market extent legislative
 prohibition could contributed market structures fragility gave rise
 happened Bear.
 MR. PARKINSON. can’t answer that, that’s good question. mean, basic
 problem tremendous demand investments essentially
 characteristics Treasury bills, supply Treasury bills isn’t nearly large demand
 coming money market mutual funds investment cash collateral securities
 lending kinds secured financing. time, marketplace come
 synthetic Treasury bills various sorts, short-term investments created outside
 banking system large inability pay interest demand deposits doesn’t
 allow provided banking system. Now, prohibition removed, think
 would see banks offering things would competing overnight repos, overnight
 commercial paper, sorts things outside banking system meeting
 needs.
 terms effects stability, whether leaves us better place obviously would
 depend good job regulating maturity transformation commercial banking
 system. interesting question is—whenever hear Art give presentation look
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 150 253
 
 stress tests we’re applying investment banks, even current conditions,
 they’re offering overnight interest-bearing deposits—how well banks would fare
 tested standards. think observation question good ones.
 MR. LACKER. mention sounds though would worthwhile
 knowing it’s important. Since we’ve asked Congress twice permission pay interest
 they’ve declined, factor recent crisis, might want point
 part legislative dialogue next couple months try get
 something.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. comment President Lacker’s question:
 guess end would depend big Bear Stearns’s balance sheet would
 whether paying interest demand deposits commercial banks would somehow shrunk
 Bear Stearns’s balance sheet secured funding could run. it’s pretty
 complicated. It’s obvious whether would made Bear Stearns smaller player
 less significant part market, it’s interesting. Tim looks though wants say, “Yes,
 would.”
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. No. May I? know, think money funds
 finance quarter third stuff tri-party. Money funds unique type
 liquidity risk. possible, set assets financed banks, banks
 different liquidity risk system would stable. maybe say, even
 balance sheets investment banks mix illiquid stuff financed
 mechanism, banks dominant providers liquidity provided banks,
 system would stable, broader protections designed last

 151 253
 
 century limit risk runs banks risk system might power,
 insulating us system nonbanks large. think that’s argument.
 would interesting know bit politics Hill thinking
 legislative change. would probably look little like Middle East, suspect. [Laughter]
 would huge change relative return different types financial businesses
 would come that. would worth knowing bit history debate
 past probability could get something like through.
 MR. KOHN. also question, Mr. Chairman, it’s PDCF. find
 tension attitudes here. leaning people borrow helps protect
 Board’s decision unusual exigent, credit couldn’t otherwise available,
 that. it’s supportive that. hand, sounds really like used
 commercial banks time thought created stigma process. don’t want
 borrow. come borrow, given don’t want borrow, must really
 hurting overcome Art Angulo’s Bill Dudley’s frown. think this, less
 useful thing backstop sense. don’t know. don’t easy answer
 resolve tension.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, may I—not preempt Art Scott—in
 case? completely agree. important undermine value liquidity
 backstops introducing stigma use get point want dial
 people back. decisions actions took context Cantor Countrywide

 use PDCF it’s unique thing. Countrywide, know, slightly different
 similar rationale. would imprudent us substantial amount
 securities outstanding, insufficiently collateralized, event deal didn’t go through,
 viable without Bank America’s buying them.
 necessary prudent thing do. think also risk limited introduced
 stigma facilities. Barclays thing delicate. would say them, “You
 can’t use facility.” asked careful questions why,
 pattern use different everybody else’s context. completely
 agree concern stuff. think must careful going forward
 don’t things alter balance.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, something?
 MR. LACKER. Yes. general topic stigma lending facilities, think
 would useful agenda item future research, would useful us work
 thinking carefully this. Stigma represents information revelation market participants
 attending act, whether it’s borrowing us someone else. usual

 You’ve heard say before. Expanding lending forces us extend regulatory reach,

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Yes. know, deep, consequential questions

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. brief. lot views
 shared already. expand President Rosengren’s comment—how define
 right institutions, scope this, think questions really hard.
 understanding workgroups talked last time going working
 things, need get well way help us define problems.
 longer-term problem—Vice Chairman Geithner made point, want

 reiterate it—it really important short run things constrain longerterm options. slippery slope long run ends transformed series
 short-term steps, almost inevitably end places don’t want be.
 want make sure stay abreast let happen us—that find
 six months position where, gee, wish hadn’t done that.
 wanted stress again.
 I’m fine extending facilities end year. don’t
 tremendous problem that, although always little puzzled “unusual
 exigent circumstances.” really mean? define that? would lot
 easier think take knew criteria putting on.
 would helpful me, anyway, could work defining criteria little
 rigorously. know judgment involved end day. don’t disagree
 that. would help us define mean going really
 hard define mean “systemically important institution.” sure know
 answer that. think difficult question. okay short run.
 reiterate point President Stern made issue credibility
 commitment. know, talked lot last couple years
 regarding monetary policy. applies equally well framework. Figuring ways
 implement policies, whatever may be, time-consistent committed way,
 defining boundaries live them, really hard problem. don’t
 think avoid dealing it, going critical piece think
 longer term. leave that.

 you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. maybe variation Governor
 Warsh’s comment yesterday: Much said many, try take much
 time here. think Vice Chairman Geithner’s admonitions correct, certainly support
 them. quite supportive extending year-end, short-term plan
 Chairman laid seems quite sensible me.
 don’t well-informed well-thought-out answers detailed questions

 thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Evans.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also try brief, spite large

 longer-term issues, happy hear giving speech
 testimony this, looking forward lay issues. Obviously,
 large-scale changes regulatory environment contemplated.
 happen every then. opportunity improve make tremendous
 mistake careful. think it, obviously, requires tremendous amount
 time.
 People talked various issues, won’t dwell them. think
 lot good comments around table speeches laid important
 issues facing. One sure talk bit
 can’t think static environment. Obviously, markets dynamic.
 soon lay structure help certain types institutions, going
 opportunity arbitrage that. presumably talking reducing earnings
 number institutions, seeking out. Another way characterize
 big question—it nothing new—is maintain incentives market discipline. Many
 comments President Stern others made think preparing
 possible resolutions important. looking forward many discussions
 this. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think would like dig
 comments President Lockhart President Evans made, second, take step
 back, ask conversation. know timing
 PDCF, happened financial markets evolved way simply

 persistence, extent, depth, spread crisis long went
 covered. Every couple months, thought over, another wave
 would come. think learned something financial system process,
 learned regulatory structure liquidity provision structure

 testified front last week, supportive memorandum
 understanding Fed SEC particularly supportive efforts
 Federal Reserve Bank New York regulators leading strengthen
 infrastructure OTC derivatives markets. didn’t get tri-party repos, fortunately.
 I’m sure would supportive that, too.
 think everybody raised good questions where, new financial
 system, draw boundaries. need do? easy answers here,
 look forward coming back this. going-in position liquidity facilities outside

 system make resilient things happening outside, totally dug that.
 look forward discussion. going hard draw line make
 credible. agree, partly defining mean “systemic,” don’t think
 ever really get point bright line around that. always need great
 amount judgment, combined with—as said, Mr. Chairman—a process make
 decision, help limit moral hazard. Crises always difficult. get crisis,
 near-term costs much palpable long-term costs might there.
 always hard say “no.” said “no” past certain circumstances. Drexel
 obvious example. Markets little stressed. little disorder. fine,
 different circumstance. think completes remarks. Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let make prefatory comments,
 try answer couple key questions memo. First, crisis terrible thing
 waste. sense opportunity right thing period try
 get market discipline—to Charlie’s point—back vibrant working countercyclically
 regulatory discipline capital standards. opportunity. contemplate
 six-months-and-a-day problem, September year-end? agree
 Vice Chairman Geithner’s comment need keep options open, make
 proposal moment that.
 Second, memo staff said improvements financial markets
 resulted, importantly, availability special liquidity facilities, agree that.
 wouldn’t give short shrift things going markets
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 184 253
 
 improved market functioning. don’t think fair say deserve
 disproportionate amount credit happened. seen ton capital-raising.
 seen lot diversification funding sources. seen changes duration
 financial institutions. seen improved disclosure transparency. seen big
 write-downs. seen brutal changes management teams. seen pairing
 business lines improved risk management. strikes market discipline alive
 well. necessary us did, think hangs way much
 facilities suggest thing keeping system together.
 final prefatory comment, memo says investors indicated
 willingness lend primary dealers recent months, conditioned
 dealers’ access PDCF. strikes proves much. sure good
 thing. concerns late cycle, look back, include market discipline
 broke down. short term, obviously, want see money market mutual
 funds President Rosengren’s neck woods hang institutions
 don’t sort panic coming. short medium term, want guys
 money market mutual funds recognize that, providing funding overnight,
 making investment decision risk. hesitate suggest want
 things period let complacent. want things make
 focused decisions making.
 bit key questions asked memo. First, liquidity facilities,
 question PDCF symmetry TSLF, like notion balance
 auction one available regularly. recognize
 PDCF, whether intended not, stigmatized. Lehman Brothers,
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 185 253
 
 darkest day, answered question differently, dare say might
 existence. asked, “Have accessed PDCF?” answer was, “Absolutely
 not.” answer “yes,” suspect could
 different circumstance. prove? think proves existence
 facilities matters. keeps institutions game. particular terms matter less. also,
 extremis, accessing facility, unlike securities lending facility, causes losing
 considerable amount control one’s fate. think take
 consideration.
 considerable leverage institutions time. matter
 lobbyists say, want us regulator possibly contain
 themselves—mostly credibility mostly balance sheet. worry
 extend PDCF punting road months, lose
 leverage. one idea, must say haven’t explored much probably should,
 extending PDCF, modifying way would make Bagehot proud—by
 making expensive, widening spread. Now, things could
 short-term extension modify terms—changing collateral changing haircuts.
 strikes price might interesting way say, “Listen, aren’t pre-judging outcomes,
 see move aren’t comfortable status quo, asking
 hard questions brought bear.” could send important
 signal, don’t think would overly disruptive markets explained
 rationale it.
 Let turn, finally, prudential supervision questions. note answer
 first question, “How limit moral hazard continue facilities?” bold
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 186 253
 
 answer “carefully,” guess much there. principles supervisory
 expectations based? think Art talked rightly different regulatory frameworks
 big money center commercial banks investment banks. We’d
 disservice period, Mr. Chairman, take regulatory regime
 long time big complex commercial banks try put investment banks.
 I’ll answer way began. opportunity start blank sheet paper,
 four institutions period, figure really, really good regulators,
 building lessons learned traditional supervision regulation
 function. think would making mistake saying, “We model, let’s
 throw guys.” regulate four institutions way long
 regulating commercial banks OCC others, think won’t maximized
 best regulation. goal would figure regulate four right then,
 frankly, export lessons long make regulation better
 stronger across group. turns Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley
 Citi JPMorgan, suggested, find people
 business investment banking, won’t done terribly much mitigate systemic
 risk.
 Finally, question role Congress. medium term, Mr.
 Chairman, context speeches get toward end July,
 announce modification—if FOMC agrees—about facilities PDCF,
 important Congress given serious responsibility this. easy
 criticize, one hand, whisper us support, other. think
 need given important homework assignments terms do.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 187 253
 
 form FDICIA investment banks might one example. Wrestling
 issues terms regulatory organizations strikes consequential. Even could
 convince regulatory authority figure regulators,
 would better off, ready right answer view,
 bring Congress final clarity get imprimatur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. agree lot Governor Warsh
 said lot said before. Let take slightly different tack answering
 question Governor Kohn raised: here? Part is, GlassSteagall Act, unusual structure United States. central banks
 provide credit much easily wide variety institutions. legacy created
 separation, isn’t strong countries. continental Europe,
 example, don’t really see this. Then, built regulatory regime helped
 promote that. Remember, discussions markets challenges
 markets. Well, think regulatory regime, United States throughout
 world, helped promote disintermediation promote greater reliance markets.
 certain ways good thing, creates exactly kinds problems challenges
 facing now.
 think need mindful take account thinking
 next dealing issues. Thinking market resiliency market
 infrastructure crucial, also mindful that, try get things migrate
 exchanges, clearinghouses, et cetera, great us regulators, also useful
 information much centralized. also could create market dynamics,
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 188 253
 
 President Evans said, could lead trying get around that. risky stuff goes OTC.
 risky stuff new institutions haven’t thought yet. President Yellen mentioned
 institutions. mention hedge funds money market mutual funds,
 five years may institutions haven’t even thought about. matter
 structure set up, would ways try get around it. need think
 regulatory regime gets costs benefits right make different relevant institutions
 bridle much part rethink financial holding company structure.
 investment banks found financial holding company structure amenable one,
 wouldn’t either would solved Glass-Steagall legacy
 problem. haven’t quite done that.
 actually exactly Governor Warsh saying—and believe not, didn’t
 coordinate beforehand—I think think revise general regulatory
 structure get institutions umbrella, find scary, upsetting,
 disturbing see reasonable cost–benefit way. see
 issues facing regarding capital relief particular circumstances—
 so-called 23.80 relief particular types transactions, issues what’s included
 definition leverage ratio. think gives us opportunity rethink many
 institutions find onerous lacking desire part regime. Obviously,
 regulatory competition—President Rosengren, think, brought up—so need
 think whole. part homework assignment Congress needs
 think about—setting reasonable FDICIA-like regime broader set institutions
 would choose come regulated Fed.
 
 June 24–25, 2008
 
 189 253
 
 talking bright lines are. okay someone
 financial holding company, become part regime existing structure.
 lines aren’t completely carefully drawn. really sort cost–benefit analysis someone
 chooses apply. need think carefully costs benefits
 getting people long-term dynamics people always try get away
 regulation unless see sufficient benefit. mindful that,
 institution context broader context markets, important. Thank
 you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.
 MR. KROSZNER. Oh, apologize—I fully support going ahead extending
 facility past year-end. would make sure it’s bit immediately past yearend go time February questions year-end.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also strongly support short-term
 strategy laid Chairman. don’t see really alternative
 context. lot issues here. reality super complex,
 lot work next year ready next Administration, issues
 going become extremely relevant.
 general terms, regarding long-term issues, although got exigent
 circumstances, financial disruption, might gotten anyway. reality
 fundamental change way financial system works. banks

 kinds lending facilities didn’t worry regulating
 supervising institutions, don’t think realistic. nature changes
 financial system means extended government safety net probably would
 extended anyway. unfortunate happen crisis atmosphere.
 think think hard issue limiting moral hazard terms much
 wider range institutions.
 sympathetic issues President Stern raised,
 think kind things thought terms banking industry:
 actually set things easier firms fail systemic?
 smaller number firms actually supervise regulate, reality
 think hard we’re going extend regulation supervision

 going able limit except extent think

 creates problem, ready issue dealt with. one
 hottest issues next Administration next Congress deal with.
 really point positions carefully thought out, Board

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. obviously support strategy laid out. want
 underscore, particularly response Governor Warsh’s comments, effect

 willy-nilly extend effort make system safer. going get far enough.
 going know what’s far enough. think credible plan say, “We
 took initiative, even moment incredible delicacy dealing system, try

 sense it’s defensible sensible strategy.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. want come back one Governor Warsh’s comments, probe

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. First, completely agree that, get point

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.

 sure marginal effect would incentives.
 MR. LACKER. would also place less weight moral suasion discourage
