 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding comment Bill Dudley made
 housing prices, financial institutions, it’s going matter lot whether we’re looking
 decline 15 percent 20 percent 15 percent 30 percent. Housing inventories, unsold
 homes, high, guess I’m wondering again—we gone times—what
 factors likely get housing advancing it’s sharp decline housing prices? I’m
 hard time understanding expectation would relatively sharp decline. I’m
 translating Greenbook/OFHEO numbers Bill’s numbers, I’m sure, seems
 financial institutions ought thinking significant adjustment must still train
 we’re expecting demand pick sudden. mortgage origination challenges
 there. disequilibrium going sit extended period time?
 MR. WILCOX. guess would push back premise don’t pretty
 significant adjustment house prices built baseline. house prices measured
 OFHEO declining 7 percent year another 5 percent 2009, wouldn’t anticipate
 rebound 2010. know, ability measure would leave house prices relative
 notion fair valuation incredibly imprecise. one regression-based indicator
 follow suggests would house prices relative rents swinging relatively high
 
 August 5, 2008

 valuation noticeably low valuation. Charles Fleischman illustrated yesterday preFOMC briefing. major factor provides reason optimism construction starts
 low enough builders making progress chipping away inventory unsold
 homes. months’ supply figures remain extraordinarily high denominator
 low; terms units unsold homes, recollection we’ve chipped away half
 run-up terms absolute number units inventory. also starts continuing
 come materially current level. think process begin get
 inventories normal alignment.
 MR. EVANS. staff way front projecting housing decline,
 helpful. dissonance Bill said pretty substantial
 expectation housing-price declines?
 MR. WILCOX. don’t think so.
 MR. EVANS. 15 20 15 30?
 MR. DUDLEY. think makes complicated, though, there’s nonlinearity.
 housing-price declines turn higher side, puts stress
 financial system credit availability, leads weaker economy, puts
 stress housing sector. small differences path get amplified.
 MR. EVANS. agree chain risks, thought hearing
 David staff estimate quite substantial adjustment process housing,
 would expect financial players share assessment.
 MR. DUDLEY. wasn’t really addressing point estimate housing going

 estimate still quite wide. point resolved. resolved,
 favorable development, don’t think we’re yet.
 MR. WILCOX. would augment Bill’s comment two observations. There’s
 plenty probability mass tail. think actually two-sided risk. illustrated one
 side risk “severe financial stress” scenario. point would make
 projection national house-price declines 12 percent cumulative 2008 2009 makes
 plenty room much severe decline Florida, California, highly stressed
 areas, attempted take regional diversity account. It’s rough exercise,
 sure, we’re oblivious fact areas much worse average.
 nature averages.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman, intervention?
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. going say this. think crude
 estimates likely total losses across U.S. economy credit markets scenario like
 baseline scenario Greenbook, use Nellie Liang’s study stuff done New
 York, there’s huge amount ahead still. Even though financial market prices reflect
 expectation house-price declines significantly optimistic David’s baseline
 scenario, don’t think say confidence financial institutions already
 provisioned written losses accommodate that. trajectory house prices
 depend part financial behavior—the availability credit—as financial institutions catch
 adjust adjust capital asset growth, et cetera, risk you’ll push
 expected path house prices is. institutions prepare
 possibility you’re going much weaker economic outcome there’s
 
 August 5, 2008

 probability around that, there’s risk produce outcome
 combined effects behavior, we’re living delicate balance.
 MR. EVANS. seem taking lot insurance downside, right—
 like Merrill Lynch put option?
 MR. DUDLEY. They’ve pay lot much insurance case Merrill
 Lynch.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren—sorry. President Lacker,
 intervention?
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. point must case
 lower house prices positive effect homeownership rate. must
 mitigation, good effect. We’re obviously getting need get eventually.
 question staff is, thought sequence? mean, strikes
 we’re likely get point stability prices construction activity get
 months’ supply back historical norm. it’s sort stop variable,
 guys expecting converge smoothly, thought measures activity
 expect see stabilize first?
 MR. WILCOX. expect starts stabilize next year, followed pretty
 considerable period several quarters house prices finally stabilizing. think
 builders look ahead see they’ve cut additions supply enough make even
 rapid progress inventory unsold homes. question dynamics
 house prices tricky one depends model expectations one assumes
 homebuyers have. every homeowner rational economic being, it’s pretty
 unambiguous lower level home prices would elicit greater optimism part home
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 33 145
 
 shoppers that, gee, valuation better compared yesterday; enthusiastic
 getting housing market; happier today yesterday. think it’s
 least open question whether expectations aren’t extrapolative that. haven’t
 seen diminution in, example, Michigan survey response homeowners expect
 happen coming 12 months, think it’s serious possibility look
 recent experience extrapolate forward conclude next 12 months user
 cost owning home going really high. don’t good grip exactly
 dynamics prices housing demand be.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.

 MR. WILCOX. don’t know OFHEO capture quality automobile

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. inventories sequencing, think interesting
 plays out, learned recently—and correct wrong—that,
 inventory new homes sale, way that’s counted includes permits issued
 even though there’s home that’s built. developer may get permits may
 started home yet. may sitting pile permits. that’s correct, think is,
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 34 145
 
 means that, think sequencing what’s going happen demand begins turn
 around, permits don’t get bought, may start building permits they’ve
 already issued haven’t started building yet. correct way looking
 data?
 MR. WILCOX. don’t know story regard permits you’re
 mentioning. know cancellation rate new home sales declined bit. Previously
 emphasizing high level cancellations builders experiencing
 actually causing supply situation even worse one would infer Census Bureau

 Thus although uncertainties remain quite elevated, think little confident

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. material changes report view
 overall state financial stability, growth, inflation; talked last
 meeting, still likely long, hot summer, we’re half it. I’ll talk
 first financial institutions—make maybe four five points—and turn quickly
 economy inflation.
 First, financial institutions, think body blow financial markets real
 economy taken turmoil GSEs complete. easy us
 Washington forget bill signings don’t always solve problems. I’d say, last thing
 happens GSEs bill signed two weeks ago action isn’t taken coming
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 81 145
 
 weeks months, would surprised could get period without GSE
 turmoil finding way onto front pages. Second, terms financial market conditions,
 fall oil prices rest energy complex is, indeed, good news, strikes
 camouflaged even tougher period financial institutions would otherwise case.
 is, financial institutions somehow look little resilient, think part
 negative correlation that’s developed recent times equity prices
 financials oil prices. financial institutions strike worse condition
 market prices would suggest.
 Third, capital raising, long talked about, essential fix among financial
 institutions. way best describe capital raising maybe last nine months first
 round capital raising, November December, really vanity round.
 consisted limited due diligence, sovereign wealth funds signing up, issuers relying upon
 vaunted global brands, capital raised matter days. second round
 probably took us spring, round I’d call confessional round. [Laughter]
 round, financial institutions said, “Oh my, look real write-downs have. Look
 need real capital raising, I’m telling you, investors, know.”
 second third confessions usually less credibility first. third round round
 we’re middle of, think liquidation recap round, likely
 hardest round pull off. likely force issuers new shares new forms preferred
 stock asking investors toughest choices. assess
 strength durability core franchises. think happening real time.
 circumstance investment bank Bill mentioned outset don’t think
 sole case this. liquidation recap round later would ideal perspective
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 82 145
 
 broader economy, absolutely needed. see occurs, it’s hard
 much sanguine capital markets credit markets returning anything
 like normal anytime soon.
 Let make fourth broad point financial institutions. different
 phases capital raise, think management credibility among financial institutions least
 suspect ever period. Even new management teams come
 ways used lot credibility. would nice believe taken
 actions necessary protect franchises businesses, stakeholders skeptical
 they’ve taken significant sufficient action. end day, matter policy
 comes terms regulatory policy Fed bank regulators accounting policy
 SEC FASB, strikes changes policy less determinative
 things shake out. is, management credibility question cure likely come
 accounting rules regulators markets’ believing management says
 management believes act it. result, think many financial
 institutions operating zero-defect world, posing risks real economy.
 Fifth, let make final point financials. We’ve talked lot effect
 different curves housing prices financial institutions themselves. don’t mean give
 short shrift that, would say level uncertainty associated risks
 non-housing-related assets much focus. According July 2008 data, credit
 currently extended banks, 20 percent residential real estate. 9
 percent consumer credit. leaves balance areas financial institutions
 management teams asking whether weaknesses
 emerging real economy place uncertainty assets nothing
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 83 145
 
 housing. That’s major downside risk financial institutions much focus
 shareholder stakeholder concerns.
 two open issues guide thinking, least respect
 credit markets. First, talked little last night presidents, embedded
 losses great critical mass institutions management credibility low many
 currently expected might unable survive? question I’m sure
 know answer to. Second, despite concerns effect credit markets
 broader economy talked about, monetary policy may terribly well suited
 fixing problems, financial institutions may terribly sensitive extent decide
 change stance policy.
 Taking account, let say couple words growth inflation. First,
 economic growth front, given views what’s happening credit markets, it’s
 hard believe economy get back potential anytime soon.
 continued financial stresses could last year-end, could upside
 surprise. Still, things considered, base case second-half growth still staff estimates
 owing part productivity we’ve seen recent months remarkable resiliency
 economy. look beyond horizon, though, toward Greenbook forecast 2009
 beyond, must say don’t really see inflection point take us back economic growth
 2.2 percent whatever Greenbook suggests. think we’re going period belowtrend growth quite time. view that, Congress comes back
 August recess, middle big debate “Son Stimulus” stimulus
 probabilities moved quite materially. However, obvious
 much terms helping real economy. Outside United States, share view Governor
 
 August 5, 2008
 
 84 145
 
 Kohn, I’d expect global GDP, particularly GDP among advanced foreign economies,
 major trading partners, continue disappoint, making remarkable addition net export
 growth GDP likely dissipate.
 Turning finally inflation, view inflation risks real, believe
 risks higher growth risks. don’t take much comfort move
 commodity prices since last met. trend continues, would certainly good
 news; must say don’t feel though inflation risks moved noticeably since last
 discussion. staff expects food prices continue challenging; certainly
 view. staff also expects core import prices fall rather precipitously. I’m little skeptical
 view. think it’s possible, don’t really see catalyst given see
 changes input prices overseas given expectations dollar foreign exchange markets.
 that, think inflation risks real, I’ll save balance remarks
 next round. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren.
 MR. ROSENGREN. support alternative B. would actually prefer President Yellen’s

 We’re unlikely, view, get confirming convincing evidence whether

 Hoenig. request tight policy somewhat less accommodative policy;
 choose go funds rate increase today, think language must help prepare markets

 Well, think that’s partly true, I’m concerned somehow conveys impression
 problem inflation oil commodities, fact correctly concern
 inflation oil. concern stance policy. would put table
 possibility saying “inflation high, partly spurred high oil commodity prices”
 say it’s short-term behavior commodity prices. think word “also”

 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. let talk little monetary policy,
 I’ll brief there. use opportunity raise issues Committee
 I’m here. support alternative B. obvious earlier discussion, believe

 simpler say “the downside risks growth upside risks inflation concern
 Committee.” don’t see need “both,” we’re actually wavelength terms
 issue.
 I’d like spend time on—because feel sort swan song,
 maybe I’m classy guy, I’ll call “valedictory remarks”—are three concerns
 Committee going forward. I’m going able participate, chance
 lay out. first real danger focusing much federal funds rate
 reflecting stance monetary policy. dangerous. want talk that. Second
 think it’s absolutely critical keep options open current circumstances,
 want talk that. third communication issue, it’s going

 other. hope consider it, that’s something don’t need go here.
 First all, let talk issue focusing much federal funds rate
 indicating stance monetary policy. something that’s dear heart.
 chapter textbook deals whole issue talks deep mistakes
 made monetary policy exactly focus short-term interest rate
 indicating stance monetary policy. particular, think stance
 monetary policy, look asset prices, means look interest rates. asset
 prices important effect aggregate demand. Also look credit market

 conditions things actually reflected market prices still
 important. don’t that, make horrendous mistakes. Great Depression
 classic example made two mistakes looking policy interest rate. One
 didn’t understand difference real nominal interest rates. mistake I’m
 worried here. People fully understand that. example nominal rates went
 down, default-free Treasury securities; fact, skyrocketed ones.
 stance monetary policy incredibly tight Great Depression, disaster.
 Japanese made mistake, much hope Committee make
 mistake tell situation scary me. I’m holding two houses right
 now. I’m nervous. [Laughter]
 second issue it’s absolutely critical keep options open. relates
 points already made discussion—I argued don’t know situation
