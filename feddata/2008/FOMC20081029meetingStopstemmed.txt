 now, number concern object rais. let address
 them. on presid bullard’s interest present inflat trap, intuit
 it’s clear that, given real interest rate, equilibrium high
 nomin rate high expect inflat rate low nomin rate deflat.
 thing possibl. trap japan got into. obvious want
 avoid deflat trap. question is, avoid it? far see—obvious
 get thi—the best two wai avoid ar, first, presid lacker suggest,

 second object i’ve heard question whether action effect.
 think effect. mayb thei’re effect normal circumst, let
 put wai. cut 50 basi point todai libor–oi spread rise 50 basi
 point tomorrow, accept there’s problem. libor spread doesn’t move much
 overal libor drop 50 basi point, think we’re effect. look
 libor past year, you’ll see dramat declin even though spread widen.
 don’t think argu we’re effect. extent we’re mute
 effect, well argu aggress need
 get impact. understand concern, reiter, respond governor duke
 other, get low, side effect certain institut financi
 market. need understand those, that’s part decis process. don’t think it’s
 case monetari polici zero impact.
 third argument i’ve heard “keep power dry” argument. unless think
