 Transcript Federal Open Market Committee Meeting
 September 16, 2008
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everybody. Sorry late beginning.
 markets continuing experience significant stresses morning,
 increasing concerns insurance company AIG. reason Vice Chairman
 Geithner attending, Chris Cumming sit place.
 want turn minute Bill Dudley usual report, able give
 information situation. another action item would like add, given
 happening, significant problems dollar funding
 jurisdictions—in Europe elsewhere. Bill makes presentation
 discussion, would like put table request authorization swap lines. prefer
 put limit it, know I’ve got bazooka here. [Laughter] Foreign
 Currency Subcommittee consists myself, Vice Chairman FOMC, Vice
 Chairman Board. Again, Bill’s discussion, would like discuss possibility
 giving us temporary authority use swap lines needed.
 turn Bill, let say one thing. Obviously, started late.
 lot talk about. would like—just today, would indulge me—to condense
 discussion one round. discussion, please include tentative views policy
 decision. Obviously, ideal heard everyone else’s views,
 opportunity afterward people amend, revise, give additional thoughts.
 interest time, think would efficient time way.
 Without ado, let turn Bill ask report.
 MR. DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. going go
 great detail. look charts leisure. 1 going focus

 materials Mr. Dudley refers appended transcript (appendix 1).

 going right now, responded it, think issues
 are. give snapshot happened since Sunday evening, stocks
 worldwide—4 percent plus everywhere. Yesterday, U.S. stock market
 4½ percent, S&P futures indicate lower opening today.
 might expect, big flight quality, especially Treasury bill
 market. Ten-year Treasury note yields fell 30 basis points yesterday,
 big rally throughout Treasury curve. big thing,
 probably severe stress market, dollar liquidity foreign
 banks. remember, foreign banks, especially Europe, structural
 dollar funding shortfall, look execute foreign exchange swaps borrow
 dollar LIBOR market fund that. significant upward pressure
 market—overnight LIBOR rates today 6.44 percent—and pressure
 Europe leaking market. Yesterday federal funds rate opened
 3 3½ percent. Despite $20 billion repo normal 9:30 a.m. time,
 upward pressure funds rate yesterday continued. rose high
 6 percent late morning, came second operation
 $50 billion around noon yesterday.
 try effect issue, morning came much earlier
 normally do—around 8:00 a.m. $50 billion overnight repo.
 funds rate time trading 3¼ percent. think means
 obviously adding way many reserves current maintenance period;
 good news that, maintenance period week tomorrow,
 get fresh start. current time think see essentially lot firmness
 funds rate morning funds rate trading zero late
 day. funds rate averages relative target going somewhat
 difficult say. Yesterday, despite collapse funds rate essentially zero
 end day, funds rate quite firm relative target. don’t
 remember numbers, 2½ percent range. going try hit
 target average, going difficult. current circumstances,
 probably sensible—at least advice would be—to err side
 providing enough liquidity market rather trying cute worrying
 target federal funds rate.
 Now, Lehman filing also intensified pressure Morgan Stanley
 Goldman Sachs number respects. Lehman failure means investors
 view debt Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs much risk
 Sunday. means firms need bigger liquidity buffers
 before, implications long-term profitability.
 consequence, share prices fell sharply yesterday. Morgan Stanley
 $5 share, $32, Goldman Sachs’s stock 18 points,
 $135. Morgan Stanley experienced modest, insignificant, pulling back
 counterparties ate liquidity buffer measurable degree.
 Lehman problems also evident areas. incomplete,
 ones came attention money market funds—especially,
 Reserve Fund large withdrawals, encountered significant liquidity

 problem. actually sure resolved, think State Street
 situation cover large shortfall Reserve Fund last
 night. risk here, course, that, AIG fail, money funds even
 broader exposure Lehman, breaking buck money
 market funds real risk. capital resources entities associated
 money market funds often quite modest, ability top
 money funds keep whole quite limited. Thus money market funds
 definitely one important issue contagion could broader.
 second issue people dealing Lehman
 positions Lehman counterparty wind positions.
 know, parent filed bankruptcy, U.S. broker-dealer still
 operation. operation doesn’t mean necessarily conducting
 business normal way. One issue received lot attention
 asset managers mortgage TBA positions Lehman. Apparently,
 sell side net pretty easily FICC (Fixed Income Clearing
 Corporation), asset managers positions Lehman either take
 mortgage-backed securities sell mortgage-backed securities forward basis,
 really sure positions going get
 date. Lehman executing trades yesterday, asset managers
 unfortunate position knowing do. offset
 Lehman position trade elsewhere not? another openended issue market. terms market function yesterday, manageable
 sense markets trade. think much soon think
 going make based yesterday’s move move, even
 though wasn’t particularly severe terms of, example, share price
 movement, cause quite bit damage, people still pulling away.
 course, also issue AIG. AIG problem least starting
 liquidity crisis. problem AIG parent company doesn’t
 lot liquidity resources doesn’t easy ability funnel liquidity
 subsidiaries subsidiaries regulated entities. AIG
 running two problems: One, unable roll commercial paper and,
 two, ratings downgraded—they downgraded Moody’s yesterday,
 think AA minus minus, don’t quote that—they post
 lot collateral derivatives exposures also respect
 GIC (guaranteed investment contract) business. AIG situation
 parent basically going run money—today, tomorrow, Thursday, very,
 soon. say it’s liquidity thing, lot times people look
 closer books find liquidity crisis may also solvency issue.
 think still little unclear whether AIG’s problems confined liquidity.
 also may issue much company really worth.
 Finally, let talk bit facilities introduced weekend.
 Basically, two things. broadened Primary Dealer Credit Facility
 (PDCF) significantly terms collateral eligibility. Whereas, before, PDCF
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 6 108
 
 took investment-grade securities only, broadened include basically everything
 tri-party repo system. felt that, backstopping tri-party repo
 system completely, would reassure tri-party investors didn’t face rollover
 risk, would keep tri-party investors investing banks. seems
 mostly happened, least yesterday. get quite bit PDCF
 borrowing yesterday evening, predominantly Lehman. $28
 billion Lehman borrowing. think total borrowing something order
 $42 billion. telling borrowing associated
 Lehman’s able roll tri-party repo positions
 investors. don’t really know reasons borrowing, probably
 mostly test facility opposed actual need. broadening PDCF
 collateral eligibility seem working, far least, keeping tri-party
 investors game continuing provide funds primary dealers.
 second thing Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF).
 terms collateral requirements, AAA-rated RMBS, CMBS,
 asset-backed securities. broadened collateral, terms
 old Primary Dealer Credit Facility. think quite bit
 collateral primary dealers AA, A, BBB classes assetbacked securities, CMBS, RMBS. think going provide
 support primary dealers terms funding liquid collateral
 environment. also increased size. original authorization $200
 billion. auction schedule $175 billion, put $25 billion
 increase schedule 2. Remember, schedules 1 2. Schedule 1
 Treasuries agencies. Schedule 2 Treasuries, agencies, stuff.
 schedule 2 auctions going go size, frontloaded increase
 TSLF fully subscribed. actually going able
 two TSLF schedule 2 auctions week $35 billion, going get
 quite bit TSLF liquidity market week, think also
 helpful.
 things stand. Otherwise, think things market
 would expect. flight quality. Japanese yen Swiss
 franc outperforming. dollar sort middle, high-yielding
 currencies continue pressure. seen
 last year underlying risk trades. lot material, ask
 questions get that. think leave there.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Questions Bill? President Rosengren.
 MR. ROSENGREN. amplification State Street situation.
 understanding money actually went out. $20 billion withdrawals
 came late day. $7½ billion credit line. State Street enough collateral
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 7 108
 
 $7½ billion. unwilling $20 billion. asked us position was,
 told needed make business decision case. haven’t
 heard happened morning. assume scrambling funds. would
 emphasize real concern run week money market funds
 may freeze funds. possible break buck,
 organizations don’t sufficient capital make people whole. think
 real concern.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. question PDCF, expansion collateral base.
 said $42 billion, $28 billion Lehman. know kind
 collateral Lehman posted? actually make use expanded options not?
 nature it, know?
 MR. DUDLEY. actually even known late yesterday evening. takes
 us get reports clearing bank able go tell
 collateral is. terms Lehman collateral, allowed broaden PDCF—
 basically bringing us stuff Friday. also important recognize
 Lehman demanding lot higher collateral requirements non-Treasury nonagency securities. collateral haircut 20 percent. Fed taking
 credit exposure there, put place Friday—and continuing that—a 20 percent
 collateral haircut non-Treasury non-agency stuff PDCF exposure
 Lehman. think that’s roughly three times market level investors
 charging previously, think gives us fair degree protection.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 8 108
 
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. higher collateral requirement,
 Lehman?
 MR. DUDLEY. time, believe right.
 MR. LACKER. Okay. know lot concern going yesterday
 tri-party repo market, envisioned two scenarios anything them. One triparty lenders pulling away particular names moving funds names.
 Another, extreme, would tri-party repo lenders pulling away market
 whole. look tri-party repo market point view borrowers,
 frightening scenario. lenders going something money.
 curious would do. understanding cash balances, essentially deposit
 accounts, piled State Street BONY yesterday able tri-party
 repos institutions pulled away from. valid observation?
 prospects providing kind resilience tri-party market?
 MR. DUDLEY. Well, guess first thing would say absolutely right.
 investors pull away, take money somewhere. doesn’t disappear. think
 Primary Dealer Credit Facility shown pretty significant providing
 support market. look happened Lehman, example, even though
 Lehman extreme pressure Friday, tri-party repo investors stayed Lehman
 Friday night, actually surprised me. think reason stayed
 knew didn’t really lot rollover risk. long broker-dealer didn’t file
 bankruptcy weekend—and risk really taking—the Federal
 Reserve PDCF would tri-party repo investor last resort. Lehman’s
 experience suggests that, contain broad parameters crisis
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 9 108
 
 doesn’t spread much further, keep tri-party repo investors bolting
 don’t really huge amount risk long behind take
 overnight obligation comes due next day.
 MR. LACKER. So, follow up, understanding tri-party repos
 exempt automatic stay, filing per se risk. It’s risk
 don’t cash, right?
 MR. DUDLEY. Well, I’m sure that. thought issue
 broker-dealer filing. know clearing banks certainly quite nervous
 eventuality, I’m lawyer.
 MR. PARKINSON. repos exempt automatic stay provisions
 bankruptcy code. Lehman gone SIPA liquidation, could subject
 SIPA stay.
 MR. LACKER. right. question TSLF. program
 provide Treasuries?
 MR. DUDLEY. give Treasuries, give us stuff. know,
 also probably helpful week providing Treasuries market.
 tremendous amount Treasury fails yesterday. mechanism two things. takes
 illiquid collateral dealers, also supplies lot Treasuries market,
 help improve market function Treasuries.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions? Bill, would able talk bit
 need swaps?
 MR. DUDLEY. sketchy details based phone call, may
 quite right. understanding morning Norway put place facility
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 10 108
 
 going offer banks dollars, $5 billion, one-week term—sort open
 facility. fact Norway suggests situation broadened quite bit
 first time heard Norway story, except
 maybe exposures Icelandic banks.
 conversations counterparts ECB morning—this
 staff level, can’t really say would happen take chain
 command. certainly, least preliminary basis, quite bit interest
 similar facility ECB, would TAF loan type facility open
 facility European banks could come get dollars. would reassure people
 dollar liquidity available Europe throughout European day. advice
 probably good idea environment seeing lack dollar
 liquidity Europe really feedback effect people’s willingness business
 one broader markets. think open ECB
 perhaps Bank England Bank Japan well—at least ability
 prove necessary.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. two-hander, Governor Kohn?
 MR. KOHN. note discussion foreign exchange swaps
 Committee Global Financial System week half ago, general consensus
 handy damping pressures money markets—dollar funding markets
 particular—when foreign exchange swap market isn’t working well Europe
 Switzerland. central banks around table, major central banks, quite
 supportive expanding facility. talking putting something standby
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 11 108
 
 basis use situations like this. central banks view helpful
 containing pressures markets.
 MR. DUDLEY. Bank Japan requested staff level set facility
 would shelf year-end Japanese quite worried banks
 going face dollar funding problem year-end. Now, preceded recent crisis, even
 last week concerned Japanese banks could potentially
 problems, interested exploring us facility place.
 actually going pursue this, hope October FOMC meeting
 sooner.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Bill, going take action today, would
 recommend terms counterparties? say unlimited amount? specify
 amount? leave time open? recommendations
 dimensions?
 MR. DUDLEY. Certainly want make pretty broad. want make
 Bank England, Switzerland, ECB, Bank Japan, potentially Canada. would leave
 discretion would like participate. would make offer them;
 want participate, willing that. terms size, think really
 important don’t create notions capacity limits market always try
 test those. Either numbers very, large, open ended. would
 suggest open ended better really provide backstop entire
 market. we’ve seen PDCF, provide suitably broad backstop, oftentimes
 don’t even actually need use great degree. think strategy here.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 12 108
 
 MR. LACKER. Remind big European system central banks’
 outright holdings dollar balances are.
 MR. DUDLEY. European banks?
 MR. LACKER. Yes.
 MR. DUDLEY. don’t know.
 MR. LACKER. Central banks.
 MR. DUDLEY. mean terms dollar foreign exchange reserves?
 MR. LACKER. Right. ECB—they dollar reserves.
 MR. DUDLEY. don’t numbers.
 MR. SHEETS. believe number $180 billion dollar reserves euro
 system. ECB control fraction that.
 MR. LACKER. held individual national central banks, swap lines
 aren’t approaching level yet, right?
 MR. DUDLEY. No.
 MR. LACKER. Note sense discomfort lending dollars
 already serving substitute mobilizing dollar reserves
 purpose. Obviously, demand could swamp reserves, point would
 feel differently this. understanding distribution within European
 system central banks uneven, sense provides way
 circumvent negotiating dollars would distributed different central banks
 different private-sector banks within system. Broadly, I’m uncomfortable
 playing role.
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 13 108
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Whether it’s sensible not, ECB made pretty
 strong distinction us foreign exchange reserves dollars use
 operations. really want keep segregated. want, extent,
 represent collaborative effort United States opposed something
 taking behalf. perspective—actually President Poole raised
 issue earlier on, discussion—they seem put lot value distinct
 swap line, symbolizes cooperation coordination two central banks
 opposed simply using reserves. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, going say discussion before.
 approve swap lines. wonder could summarize us view
 downside risk this.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, don’t think significant downside risks.
 operational issues Bill Dudley team worry about. extend
 funds Europeans, relay banks, affects reserve positions
 affects management federal funds rate requires sterilization. That’s operational
 issue. suppose, really large draws, would begin affect
 balance sheet constraint concerns have. think entirely separate issue,
 certainly one looking terms trying get interest reserves
 kinds measures.
 Again, expectation facility would part provide confidence
 much actually extend. guess operational issues
 draw balance sheet would downside, me, seems relatively
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 14 108
 
 straightforward step—one we’ve done past one additional benefit
 indicating global cooperation issues.
 MR. DUDLEY. principle, could talk ECB central banks
 rate swap lines slight penalty relative normal times try
 mitigate potential reserve impact. mean, doesn’t 2 percent 2¼ percent
 overnight funds—it could somewhat north that. credible backstop,
 calm markets, backstop used. backstop
 actually used, presumably market conditions horrific.
 environment, could argue reserve-management things second order
 concerns sense.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. comments? right. I’d like propose
 FOMC delegate Foreign Currency Subcommittee unspecified authority, terms
 amount, offer swaps foreign central banks needed address liquidity pressures
 jurisdictions. decisions made, again, Foreign Currency Subcommittee
 consultation Open Market Desk. would keep FOMC closely informed,
 would revisit discuss issue October. acceptable resolution?
 amendments that? discussion, comments, concerns? President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Yes. favor this. wonder marketplace look
 open-ended nature typically dollar magnitudes associated
 swaps. may go relatively smoothly; hand, may raise questions exactly
 think issues here.
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 15 108
 
 MR. DUDLEY. Well, think going discussions foreign
 counterparts decide right strategy is. think right better open
 ended.
 MR. STERN. That’s fine.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. don’t discussions counterparties—
 won’t announce anything today, would assume?
 MR. DUDLEY. No, think take chain command,
 here. it’s going take probably day.
 MR. KOHN. would come minutes meeting.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Right. We’ll announce something.
 MR. STERN. assume announcement point.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. course. would announce measure?
 MR. DUDLEY. think would we’ve chance—I mean, think
 lot work foreign counterparties. basically raised morning.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. conditional agreements
 discussions counterparties. come joint communication
 announcement strategy. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. one clarification. basic objection this. wonder
 whether not, FOMC going delegate decision group, sort openended delegation ongoing basis. make sense define period time
 open-ended delegation appropriate—that would expire would
 renewed?
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 16 108
 
 MR. DUDLEY. Yes. authorities extending right January 30 lot
 facilities, would certainly reasonable time frame, think.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Existing facilities go January 31, right?
 MR. MADIGAN. January 30.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. January 30. Would acceptable?
 MR. PLOSSER. Yes. think ought termination point that, wanted
 renew it, would free so, wouldn’t last forever.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. course.
 MR. KOHN. One clarification, Mr. Chairman—this intended G-10 central
 banks, include ECB. clear, somebody asks, give central banks
 emerging-market economies.
 MR. DUDLEY. presume so.
 MR. KOHN. think presume so. happen, would come
 back Committee.
 MR. DUDLEY. Yes, major financial centers ability large
 banks operate globally obtain dollar funding.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. amend proposal terminate January 30.
 President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Could hear little benefits open-ended
 commitment? programs capped certain size. said something
 “test limits,” makes think foreign exchange regimes. kind scenario
 mind?
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 17 108
 
 MR. DUDLEY. think lot programs actually open ended.
 discount window open ended sense it’s limited amount collateral
 banks post there. Primary Dealer Credit Facility open ended limited
 size tri-party repo system. point that, foreign banks worry capacity limits,
 even large program could principle sufficient extremis. program
 open ended, rollover risk problem goes away. lend dollars today, don’t
 worry getting dollars back always know facility there. it’s really
 elimination ability flatten position need terms dollar
 exposures.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It’s open ended sense open window
 anybody come take. gives us authority adjust amount.
 MR. LACKER. set definite amount?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. certainly negotiate central banks
 tell we’re now. want flexibility case emergency
 respond, also don’t want communicate markets somehow hard limit
 going changed. would potentially bad confidence.
 MR. LACKER. communicate program size?
 MR. DUDLEY. think remains discussed counterparties. think
 need discussions would effective. Would big size that’s fixed
 quantity effective? Would open limit effective? think
 discussions. think important thing here—and we’re going for—is credibility. crisis
 need enough force—more force market thinks necessary solve problem—and
 we’re going discussions determine much enough force.
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 18 108
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think mostly communication issue. Anything else?
 right. want call roll one?
 MR. KOHN. move.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. need second.
 MR. FISHER. Second.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. Thank you.
 MR. PLOSSER. read resolution?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. resolution provide Foreign Currency

 MR. KOHN. move.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. objections? Okay. Thank you. Let’s turn
 economic situation. Dave Stockton Nathan Sheets.
 MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. response request
 economy remarks morning, I’m going set aside prepared remarks
 hit highlights here. receive great deal macroeconomic
 data since closed Greenbook last Wednesday. didn’t seem get
 right, netted nothing. [Laughter] Retail sales came
 considerably weaker anticipated, enough knocked
 ½ percentage point third-quarter GDP growth. offset
 higher retail inventories, rest offset stronger-than-expected
 merchandise trade report July. left us still feeling comfortable
 forecast looks us though economic growth going drop
 1 percent average second half year.
 terms things really stood intermeeting period, least
 mind, one weakness consumption. indicated, retail sales
 report weak; report hand, we’d probably mark
 current-quarter consumption forecast decline 1½ percent annual rate.
 think really remarkable weakness occurring even though
 still think spending probably receiving boost rebates. excluding
 effect, we’d looking something even weaker. Now, know, we’ve
 head-faked number times retail sales data, subject pretty
 substantial revisions. wouldn’t necessarily take report face value.
 drop we’ve seen motor vehicle purchases pretty much mirrors size timing
 kind falloff we’ve seen overall consumption spending. looks like
 weak picture consumption.
 notable development intermeeting period weakness
 labor markets—now principally payroll employment figures. Private
 payroll employment falling pretty sharply faster would
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 20 108
 
 thought. rise unemployment rate remarkable. Now,
 0.4 percentage point increase unemployment rate last month could statistical
 noise. wouldn’t entirely surprising see fall back some. 1
 percentage point rise we’ve since April going statistical noise.
 increase probably reflects bigger response emergency
 unemployment compensation program previously thought, we’ve upped
 estimates little less 0.3 percentage point level
 unemployment rate. even putting aside, experienced significant
 rise unemployment rate, think that’s consistent things we’re
 seeing terms labor market data. We’ve seen another appreciable jump initial
 claims. Announced job cuts up. Job openings down. Survey hiring plans
 softened.
 Now, sharp rise unemployment rate bit difficult square GDP
 figure looks though running 3 percent second quarter
 even 2 percent want average first second quarters together.
 occasionally large errors Okun’s law, think I’ve noted past. seems
 though Okun’s law gets obeyed frequently 55 mile hour speed limit
 I-95. [Laughter] still, one things probably considering
 perhaps economy strong suggested real GDP figures.
 Real gross domestic income, output measured income side
 accounts, risen 2 percentage points less GDP past year.
 look industrial production compare components GDP are,
 essence, goods production, there’s 1 percentage point discrepancy there,
 industrial production suggesting weaker figures GDP.
 see reason discount rise unemployment rate suggesting
 we’re entering second half labor market slack previously
 thought. Furthermore, net, we’ve revised projected growth GDP
 next two years—admittedly bit—and response two pretty strong
 crosscurrents. One significantly lower oil prices forecast.
 think they’re going provide support underlying disposable income
 spending. positive effect forecast going forward
 offset significant marking forecast net exports—which Nathan
 discussing—in response appreciation dollar downward
 revision outlook foreign activity. net, left us little lower growth
 rate carrying forward noticeably higher unemployment rate forecast
 period. Now, pretty small adjustments. don’t think we’ve seen
 significant change basic outlook, certainly story behind forecast
 similar one last time, we’re still expecting
 gradual pickup GDP growth next year little rapid pickup 2010.
 three things absolutely central producing outcome
 projection we’re going get stabilization housing 2009—and early 2009;
 diminishment drag growth financial
 turbulence; oil prices flatten out. three, mind, component
 
 September 16, 2008
 
 21 108
 
 probably central important would seeing stabilization
 housing market, big drag growth also
 consequences household wealth also there’s going
 clarity reassurance financial market participants, seems though end
 housing debacle sight. think seeing glimmers hope
 there—however, thought occasion past proven wrong.
 sales existing homes flat since turn year. Sales new
 homes flat several months now. We’ve drop mortgage interest
 rates followed takeover Fannie Freddie. Starts fallen much
 that, fact, builders making significant progress working inventory
 unsold new homes even months’ supply tipped late. think
 things looking little better us there. consequence, we’re expecting
 see bottoming-out near end year beginning next year—but
 sharp recovery. Overall residential investment actually still negative 2009
 less negative year. know Greenbook,
 estimates suggest financial restraints overall activity—actually level
 GDP—will increase 2008 2009, effects growth rate GDP
 diminishing somewhat. Finally, regard oil prices, assessment rise
 crude oil prices since beginning 2006 probably knocking ½ percentage
 point growth 2008; flattening oil prices, expect
 neutral factor next two years. That’s providing impetus. lot
 what’s going forecast bad things worsening quickly next
 year year, rather things actually getting better. guess it’s sad
 comment we’re relying second derivatives turning positive main force
 generating upward impetus economic growth. projecting gradual
 pickup.
 Now, inflation side, morning’s CPI report August actually came
 little better expecting. CPI August fell 0.1 percent.
 expecting increase 0.1 percent. surprise energy component,
 least see moderation retail food price side looking
 for, change core CPI fell back 0.2 percent string 0.3 percent
 increases. don’t think data much change basic forecast,
 total PCE prices somewhere neighborhood 5 percent rate
 third quarter, core prices 3 percent. Still, one looks back last CPIs
 PCEs, things come little higher core side. projected 3 percent
 increase ¼ percentage point August forecast,
 interpretation we’re probably seeing upward impetus passthrough higher energy prices, commodity prices, imports
 previously expected. certainly squares we’re hearing business
 contacts. also squares saw last week PPI, another
 sharp increase prices intermediate materials. least going forward, first
 time since process got way, seeing futures price
 forecast flattening out. easing prices oil commodities
 appreciation dollar giving us least little confidence
 cost pressures going abate going forward get disinflation

 forecasting. continue see reasonably encouraging signs
 inflation expectations. medium-term long-term inflation expectations
 preliminary Michigan report last week dropped 0.3 percentage point, 2.9 percent.
 TIPS haven’t really done much, hourly labor compensation continues come

 couple final remarks current events. Hurricanes Gustav Ike
 obviously created enormous amount devastation whole lot people,
 don’t really appear us significant macroeconomic consequences.
 temporary disruption oil gas extraction refining, looks
 though basic infrastructure largely spared. I’ll interested hear

 MR. SHEETS. also brief summarizing economic developments
 abroad. Indeed, would like make six brief points. first one
 incoming data we’ve received since last Greenbook foreign economies
 extraordinarily soft. Indeed, we’ve marked forecast projection
 second quarter full percentage point. data also suggest carry
 forward fair amount softness least next year. foreign
 outlook much softer before.
 second point softening outlook view key factor
 contributed sizable declines oil commodity prices. morning,
 oil prices trading around $92 barrel, another $25 barrel
 time last meeting.
 third point deteriorating foreign outlook also seems triggered
 something reassessment currency markets. Since last meeting, dollar
 strengthened nearly 5 percent broad nominal terms. view, happened
 currency markets markets priced expectation foreign
 economies would remain quite resilient face slowing United States.

 incoming data past couple months, becoming clearer
 clearer U.S. slowing going marked effect foreign
 economies, shifted relative attractiveness dollar supported
 appreciation we’ve seen last couple months.
 fourth point that, number emerging market economies, we’ve seen
 resurgence certain sorts financial vulnerabilities. We’ve seen across really broad
 array economies rising external debt spreads rising CDS spreads. We’ve
 seen falling equity prices and, number economies, downward pressures
 currencies. last point, number Asians intervening
 foreign exchange market intermeeting period actually intervening
 try prevent currencies depreciating, marked change
 we’ve seen last couple years.
 fifth point surprisingly strong performance U.S. exports we’ve
 seen appears continued July. Greenbook went bed, got
 July trade data, continue point fair amount strength export
 sector. particularly strong auto sector, broad-based strength
 July. Nevertheless, view that, given rise dollar
 softening outlook foreign growth, we’re likely see slowing export
 growth going forward.
 final point I’d like mention that, also late last week Greenbook
 went bed, received data import prices. data, really first time
 long time, showed marked deceleration material-intensive goods import prices
 finished goods import prices. forecast long time called
 deceleration import prices line projected flattening commodity
 prices projected flattening dollar.
 seems we’re point things
 incorporated forecast haven’t lot evidence starting
 materialize. dollar flattened and, indeed, somewhat stronger
 last Greenbook. lower paths commodity prices, data
 recently received showed actual deceleration core import prices, gives us
 confidence perhaps rise import prices peaked. I’ll stop there.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. questions Dave Nathan?
 MR. FISHER. Could ask one question, Mr. Chairman?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Could interpret us Bank China’s cut bank lending rate?

 MR. SHEETS. Yes. Yesterday PBOC cut main policy rate 27 basis points. guess
 felt 26 would enough 28 would much. [Laughter]
 27 right number. I’d say couple thoughts there. One important point
 inflation China decelerated significantly. spring looking twelve-month
 inflation rates around 8.3 percent. latest reading August 4.9 percent. it’s clearly
 decelerating trajectory. driven marked decline food prices. Earlier
 year, food prices moving 20 percent rate, 10 percent.

 Relative Bluebook version, language alternative B revised

 sentence B4 revised suggest Committee sees
 significant risks growth inflation roughly balanced. Given market
 participants’ expectation funds rate could trade soft target time

 appeared incorporate high odds least 25 basis point easing today possibly

 think actually 25 basis point cut probably least likely outcome market
 anticipates. evidence this, couple dealers yesterday change forecast 50 basis
 point rate cut. I’m aware anybody changed 25. Probably people like

 words that. I’ll also talk inflation front. long thought
 inflation medium term moderate, we’ve taking comfort recent
 developments cited already.
 weaker economic outlook, see intensification adverse growth coming
 many things mentioned already: unemployment rate increase likelihood consumer
 spending going negative. would put great stress also indications world demand
 slowing abruptly, Nathan mentioned. think three things occurring
 environment massive correction, adjustment, structural change autos, housing,
 financial intermediation. adjustment really interconnected—one effects
 others. part this—particularly financial sector, would say—in senior loan officer
 survey we’ve seen indications that, even rates in, say, mortgage markets start ease bit,
 nonprice terms may still tightening. President Pianalto talked areas
 borrowers facing much tougher terms. financial institutions feel capital
 constrained—and there’s plenty evidence balance sheets constrained across much
 financial sector—those kinds nonprice rationing measures probably become evident.
 Second, discussed earlier, we’ve seen credit losses, thus far largely
 confined financial sector increasingly shareholders, run risk spilling
 kinds investors, date really felt impact, money market fund
 investors, mentioned earlier. addition, three big corrections seen autos,
 housing, financial intermediation limited United States. particular,

 inflation side, mentioned, acknowledged we’ve seen elevated rates
 inflation. recent developments—as we’ve seen inflation expectations discussed earlier,

 discussed, year-over-year changes import prices—are pointing direction
 moderation inflation moderation inflation expectations. particular, looked

 Let turn financial market conditions. talked financial
 architecture. guess say today confidence I’ve able say
 dismemberment existing financial architecture accelerated last days
 weeks, quickly look business models, industry find new business
 models, hope, provide credit real economy. Financial markets testing
 financial institutions weaker capital structures, uncertain management teams, unsustainable
 business models. think question us today that’s hard judge whether financial

 CDS moves equity moves broker-dealers, Goldman
 Sachs Morgan Stanley, don’t think real specter that’s casting question
 broader financial institutions. think Lehman situation, matter judgment made
 past weekend whether provide official-sector money, driving
 markets broadly outside investment banks. What’s driving broader uncertainty
 questions institutions like AIG rated AAA, strong counterparties
 didn’t need collateral, certain bet guarantor around stable value funds
 sorts products. matter weeks AAA rating security could turn
 worthless, would force institutions evaluate two things. First, narrowly, much

 Let turn finally policy, Mr. Chairman. support alternative B and, based
 discussion Presidents Lockhart Stern, I’d make simple suggestions may
 strike balance acknowledges concerns financial markets doesn’t put us

 first sentence alternative A, paragraph 2—“strains financial markets increased

 alternative B. strike second sentence alternative B, think we’ve largely
 covered that. order gives proper attention, strikes me, financial market developments.
 Finally, assessment risk, Mr. Chairman, look last sentence, would suggest
 modifying ever slightly inserting word “closely” making one modification.
 last sentence would read, “The Committee continue monitor economic financial
 developments closely act needed promote sustainable economic growth price
 stability.” Also, think it’s acceptable, rather saying “financial developments” maybe
 would say, “The Committee continue monitor economic financial market
 developments closely.” would suggestions try strike balance—that

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. think that’s useful, although note that,

 MR. LACKER. “Monitor closely” language like that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, “monitor closely.” Maybe you’re right.
 MR. LACKER. Yes, gives pause. Then, “market”—like lot

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. sentiment side
 nobody thinks “market” important. Let’s get rid “market.” We’ll discuss “closely.”
