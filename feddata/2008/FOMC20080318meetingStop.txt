 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. WARSH. You’re still going get questions apparently. [Laughter]
 MR. LACKER. hope wife well.
 MR. DUDLEY. well, thanks.
 MR. LACKER. First, breakevens. Breakevens came lot yesterday,

 MR. MADIGAN. Three right Board’s measure.
 MR. DUDLEY. don’t number.
 MR. LACKER. concerned late-day softening problem Primary
 Dealer Credit Facility. Everything else done fairly straightforward sterilize,

 that. Now, could unravel. late-day softness becomes norm, arbitrage

 natural thing would us sort opposite repos late day return next

 MR. DUDLEY. given thought, press business, frankly,
 overwhelmed us short run. think good point. would say two things
 Primary Dealer Credit Facility ability keep funds rate target. One,
 works way hope works, going many people showing
 Primary Dealer Credit Facility. hope, time, none—because reassure repo
 investors roll repo, think dominate coming Primary Dealer

 remember, Primary Dealer Credit Facility cost tied target federal funds rate

 look, haven’t done before. one day experience. We’re going
 work issues raised, we’re going see goes, frankly.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, could add one thing this? think
 delicacy whole tri-party repo thing hard overstate. better worse, mostly
 worse, full tri-party repo market generally spread last years well beyond Fedeligible securities, get side this, lot risk stuff repo
 goes eligible collateral quality spectrum. Even world confidence
 comes back around primary dealers counterparties, thing there’s natural risk
 stuff going financed form.
 hardest thing balance try something doesn’t increase
 incentives become counterparty everybody. We’re trying make sure it’s
 backstop, backstop that’s attractive come, that’s going hard
 line walk. say that, Bill, because, lower expectations, necessary cost choice
 we’ve made we’re going take risk end funding bunch stuff like that,
 commitment way helps. hard know. Again, even
 confidence holds, reasonable probability stuff going
 move different forms hands, could delicate transition, particularly
 people read broader loss confidence stuff.
 thing that’s important point realistic expect, even
 force things announced Sunday night, don’t still wave

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank much. Thank comments.
 Let briefly summarize add points. summarize discussion, incoming data
 weak, view economy entered recession. Housing demand
 construction continued decline sharply, house-price declines somewhat
 greater expected. Housing weakness implications employment, consumer spending,
 credit conditions. also leads 21 miles empty boxcars. [Laughter]
 Financial conditions worsened considerably, reflecting weakness housing prices,
 credit markets particular highly stressed illiquid. Wider spreads offset
 decline safe rates many credit products, credit conditions tighter
 borrowers. Financial conditions likely significant drag economic growth.
 noted risk continued financial turmoil could lead serious prolonged recession,
 implying possibly large downside risk growth. respect households, consumption growth
 flattened out, generally greater pessimism labor market economic
 prospects. Consumer credit quality may worsening. Payroll employment growth turned
 negative. little expectation expressed strong help fiscal stimulus package.
 Firms generally pessimistic cautious also remain concerned cost pressures.
 Inventories look balance. Exports continue important source final demand

 slow.

 say policy less effective and, therefore, it. two ways
 looking that. addition, may benefits capital formation low financing
 rates steep yield curve keeping bank share prices entirely collapsing.
 inflation, agree much what’s said, I’m concerned it. Let
 make one simple point, though, don’t think adequately discussed. Ninety-five
 percent inflation we’re seeing either direct indirect effect globally traded

 relative price change going on. happen one way other. happen either

 happen let shock feed through; let prices energy, commodities, rise; accept
 temporary increase headline inflation; focus making sure increase headline
 inflation doesn’t feed domestic core inflation, say, wages domestic prices.
 good response is, well, we’ve lot “temporary” shocks gone

 inflation, worry little whether get benefits lower resource
 utilization terms lower inflation. look back historically previous
 slowdowns, President Stern mentioned 1990-91 discussed
 1998-99, didn’t actually formal slowdown, Committee cut rates,
 didn’t burst inflation. Obviously, slowdown 2001, main challenge
 concern inflation getting low rather getting high point. look
 past cycles—and think markets aware those—we see cuts
 federal funds rate don’t lead inflation getting control, economy
 growing strongly economy quite weak. although think situation
 uncertain, don’t think markets would read cut 75 basis points today lack
