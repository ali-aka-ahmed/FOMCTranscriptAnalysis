 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let go President Rosengren, waiting
 patiently.
 MR. ROSENGREN. two unrelated questions. One follows this,
 one term auction facility. First, given much expanded term
 auction facility, consideration minimum stop-out rate, given last
 two fairly low stop-out rates? wonder considered all, given
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 25 206
 
 much expanded size. second question gets stigma issue related
 swap lines. quite lot discussion differentiate countries.
 thought President Lacker had—if could set-off rights enable
 collateralize swaps. think going IMF attach fair amount stigma
 organization. worried spillover benefits countries negative,
 positive, stigma. One option would say either could go IMF
 would provide collateralized loans four, since sounds though
 four done deal. rather trying draw line figure whether Chile
 country appropriate, could collateralize it. held enough Treasury
 securities New York Fed, would seem would reason it.
 didn’t Treasury securities, would probably partly reflect
 mismanagement countries, wouldn’t able use facility would
 use IMF. would seem way get around stigma issues,
 someone chose come us fully collateralize it. might alternative way draw
 line rather trying come criteria seemed little difficult understand,
 went memo.
 MR. DUDLEY. term auction facility, minimum bid rate, OIS
 rate. $150 billion auction let’s say propositions $120 billion,
 winning bid rate OIS rate everybody.
 MR. ROSENGREN. I’m wondering, OIS rate come down,
 think band excess reserves, seem OIS provides much
 bigger band, example, even excess reserves. wonder whether,
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 26 206
 
 periods people considering reduction much 50 basis points,
 OIS ends low lower bound.
 MR. DUDLEY. Yes, right low rate market building
 future rate cuts. think OIS rate 1 percent three-month basis.
 MR. ROSENGREN. narrow target excess reserves narrow
 band there, wonder whether stop-out rate, lower band little higher
 OIS, might alternative way think it, excess reserves

 MR. DUDLEY. think something worth considering. emphasis right

 whether cost funds penalty. think emphasis program

 suggested, President Rosengren, future date, think would send
 mixed message market. think people would confused doing.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig. I’m sorry, Nathan answer.
 MR. SHEETS. Could respond President Rosengren’s second question?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Go ahead.
 MR. SHEETS. think put finger two difficult judgments made
 structuring facility. don’t see risk creating stigma emerging market
 economies swap network first-order concern. broadly
 recognized folks recommending larger, systemically important,
 well managed anybody else. sitting make list—and Fund
 recently done this—the economies we’re recommending would top list,
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 28 206
 
 think recognized essentially observers. see we’re really
 ratifying perceptions rather creating new ones.
 second point, choice swaps versus repos, one
 particularly tricky. much agree repos would give us little security.
 hand, swap framework gives emerging market economies little flexibility.
 going proceed, President Fisher mentioned, also creates symmetry
 industrial countries way we’re treating emerging markets
 way we’re treating them. Given successes many economies past ten
 years, see appropriate step. Nevertheless, admit choice
 swaps repos difficult one. Another thought repo structure might provide
 bit security, tried get security ways—through tranching,
 careful reviews, on.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig, I’m sorry. Go ahead.
 MR. HOENIG. No, no. fact, follows right Nathan answering.

 MR. HOENIG. it’s something ought think sooner rather later
 likelihood that, take care four get another request,
 going get three others one other.
 MR. SHEETS. Wherever draw line, going somebody

 draw line. much gap you’re going find. mind,
 next one could make case would India. However, India’s financial system

 admittedly hard judgments, tried flesh regarding issues

 October 28–29, 2008

 MR. FISHER. approached countries?
 MR. SHEETS. Yes, indeed, have. approached 552 U.S.C. (b)(4)

 .
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. encouraged that.
 MR. SHEETS. done everything possibly discourage it.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. clear.
 MR. SHEETS. That’s right. We’re advertising.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Another question Nathan swap lines works
 exactly. pattern holds Mexico, example, supports banking system—in case
 Mexico little different others, large banks foreign-owned
 (Citibank owns Banamex, Spanish banks two three large banks)—
 responsibility stop begin? possible subsidiary U.S.
 bank Spanish bank draw dollar liquidity Mexico fungible dollars move
 around world? one manner another stay Mexico?
 MR. SHEETS. couple thoughts. Certainly home-versus-host issues bedevil
 many, many discussions banking issues right now. true Mexico, suggested,
 true spades Central Eastern Europe, instead U.S. banks
 European banks tension home host. considerations
 relevant also exceedingly complicated.
 Bank Mexico Mexican authorities move address tensions
 financial system, standard set several Federal Reserve actions, Brits
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 31 206
 
 things done, believe number countries include subsidiaries
 foreign firms operating country. So, instance, United States,
 Deutsche Bank’s U.S. subsidiary access various facilities,
 coin realm announcements today. feeling Banamex, owned
 Citi, would access kinds facilities Mexican institutions.
 Now, guarantee that, would feeling. Regarding question of,
 Mexican institution gets hands dollars, happens dollars,
 understanding move around. fact, discussion, Guillermo Ortiz indicated
 date Mexican institutions net suppliers dollars United States rather
 way around.
 MR. LOCKHART. case foreign bank—they lend foreign bank
 country, Mexico case—defaulting, whose problem it? home country
 supervisor’s problem, Mexico’s problem vis-à-vis us?
 MR. SHEETS. would guess joint problem.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. I’m sure helpful, maybe give
 slightly different example another perspective. bunch U.S. affiliates
 weakest European institutions faced substantial dollar funding needs
 come us asked substantial ongoing access liquidity. substantial
 amount lendable collateral, collateral substantial market value relative needs,
 comfortable meeting needs. needs substantially exceeded might
 potentially exceed market value eligible collateral, talked home
 central bank. said that, effect, want us able meet needs
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 32 206
 
 collateral market substantial relative needs, better way us
 home country central bank meet dollar liquidity needs collateral
 meet liquidity needs provide dollar’s worth guarantees central
 bank.
 home–host thing delicate balance, Nathan said, shouldn’t fall
 host central bank. best thing possible home country central bank take
 responsibility meeting liquidity needs us help facilitate necessary.
 needs exceed would normally give terms access,
 conversation foreign central bank. So, example, weak U.S. institution
 Mexico faces substantial needs Mexico well excess eligible collateral Mexico,
 suspect would call us say, “We want meet needs.” would
 consider point liquidity-solvency spectrum comfortable
 meeting needs.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. good. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. question staff. noted countries believed
 would help market confidence. choice extending line potentially consequential
 here. two-part question. First, think risk uncertainty surrounding
 whether particular countries future able obtain swap line
 Federal Reserve? Second, would suggest say asked public
 Chairman asked Congress criteria principles used draw line
 countries swap lines don’t? know posed question
 us, would suggest say?
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 33 206
 
 MR. SHEETS. outlined memo also remarks, first
 looking economies large systemically important. second looking
 economies policies strong appears largely
 influenced contagion. third piece countries believe swap line might
 actually make difference.
 Now, let give concrete case third criterion that’s little
 abstract first two. Iceland came us requested swap line approximately $1 billion
 $2 billion, would 5 10 percent Iceland’s GDP—so fairly large
 relative size country. liabilities banking system order
 $170 billion, underlying problem really loss confidence banks.
 came conclusion $1 billion $2 billion swap line little ammunition use
 potential loss confidence $170 billion financial system. reason,
 staff recommended swap line Iceland.
 three conditions we’d emphasize. Sort subsidiary think
 appropriate European EMEs report ECB liquidity needs.
 would constrain list countries we’d look at. work list
 countries, think gets easier say “no” fewer fewer countries make case
 large systemically important. risk creating stigma, countries
 big, aren’t, that’s pretty darn objective. Now, debate about, well, what’s big
 isn’t draw line, happens three major economies
 we’re putting forward GDP around $1 trillion. seems like reasonable line
 draw. Again, there’s element arbitrariness here, line draw element
 arbitrariness it.
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 34 206
 
 MR. LACKER. first part question?
 MR. SHEETS. Oh, thought got it. first part?
 MR. LACKER. sort uncertainty might engender likelihood
 countries qualifying? recollection many economists claimed IMF

 interventions cases.
 MR. SHEETS. Well, guess I’m sure know exactly you’re driving at.
 concerned that, moving these, we’re sending negative message ones we’re
 moving on?
 MR. LACKER. I’m wondering uncertainty might created
 lack clarity who’s in, whether final list, on.
 MR. SHEETS. press release negotiating lists, clearly one
 press release, criteria looking at—that large, well-managed, fundamentally
 sound, systemically important countries. trying communicate that. addition,
 conversations folks come us—and especially get direction
 FOMC you’d like proceed issue—we very, blunt
 telling answer “no” “yes,” depending way FOMC goes.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chair, two-hander?
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Well, want point think
 absolutely right kinds questions this. think concerns substantially
 mitigated fact IMF putting place facility basically time,
 relatively little stigma range countries need it.
 universe countries would meet test eligibility swap type facility,
 
 October 28–29, 2008

 IMF us, go program conditionality bunch
 adjustments Iceland going Hungary go through.
 right raise questions. boundary problems around swap lines
 substantially mitigated fact new facility coming that’s going
 place. Raising question need swaps good, too, you’ve heard lots
 good arguments that, think realistically there’s natural division labor
 central banks classically done swap context IMF
 does. we’re natural extension central banks do. IMF moving little
 case, think mitigate signaling
 problems uncertainty created evolution scope swap lines.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.

 using repos securities, mechanism. Alternatively, IMF
 creating largely unconditional low conditionality type program, say
 everybody else goes first? tap IMF access, maybe might consider
 backstop rather coming us first place. don’t know ends.
 think that, questions raised tried answer, hit right head.
 said kind marginal, went one way, I’m leaning way
 criteria.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser, couple things. IMF
 limited resources. They’re remotely able meet needs of—
 MR. PLOSSER. don’t know needs yet, we?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, resources limited. thing
 staff asked guidance limits here. I’d like propose that, get point,
 ask voters suggest stand qualifications might have. One thing
 could do, example, would say, “I support this, do, think
 sharp line drawn point communicated way.” legislative history
 part this, communicate staff feel potential extensions.
 MR. SHEETS. put numbers IMF lending capacity—total IMF lending
 capacity $250 billion. get even high call special arrangements
 variety countries. maximum capacity $250 billion.
 $120 billion we’re proposing today would essentially half IMF could do.
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 37 206
 
 sense really see we’re proposing taking IMF’s hands largest
 potential liquidity needs, allows focus whole range additional countries.
 related point understand that, IMF executive board meeting today, managing
 director indicated getting fair amount interest new facility. really
 different kind facility, frankly, even week ago told IMF going
 able put facility together quick time, would said, “No way. There’s way
 IMF move quickly.” good could expect maybe even
 better could expected Fund. think
 minimize stigma. hand, don’t enough lending capacity really handle
 folks we’re talking today.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Bullard.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bluebook here, says, “Additionally,
 Swiss National Bank announced plans draw swap line help finance $60 billion
 purchases assets major Swiss bank.” really mind
 country like Brazil—that they’ll draw swap line purchase assets banks?
 MR. SHEETS. No, maybe folks New York want talk bit this.

 typical constraints swap lines we’d agreeing folks. swap lines

 MR. BULLARD. Well, think systemically important institutions

 MR. SHEETS. Again, we’re drawing lines here. prepared give folks carte

 whatever wanted resources.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. continue grill you, Nathan—
 MR. SHEETS. I’m earning pay today.
 MR. LOCKHART. know, atmosphere right largely precautionary
 part—they well capitalized foreign currency reserves. want deal
 hypotheticals, let’s assume recipients swap lines get liquidity crisis.
 European Central Bank approached swap lines? recognize need dollar
 liquidity, general liquidity crisis, euro would well help. sense
 whether ECB considering swap lines emerging markets?
 MR. SHEETS. don’t details that. I’ve mentioned, know
 created facility Hungarians, €5 billion facility. also approached Iceland
 time were. would speculate, don’t basis speculation,
 given emerging tensions Central Eastern Europe Northern Europe
 probably approached, don’t details that.
 MS. MOSSER. understanding approached. don’t know

 approached swap lines. many they’ll put place, don’t
 particular information point.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. want clear question. think Tim Nathan may
 answered this, it’s question President Lockhart raised earlier. Mexico’s case,
 example, almost major banks foreign owned—EU banks, Spanish banks—those
 banks clearly access dollars ECB swap line. There’s reason dollar
 funding needs banks, extent move things around, can’t satisfied
 access dollars ECB. correct incorrect assumption?
 MR. DUDLEY. collateral isn’t always right place. absolutely right
 collateral could easily moved; collateral oftentimes isn’t right place.
 MR. FISHER. Let ask Nathan question follow up, may. Obviously you’ve
 approached governor Central Bank Mexico—Ortiz visit.
 MR. SHEETS. Indeed.
 MR. FISHER. what’s argument? would assume asked questions.
 MR. SHEETS. Yes, absolutely.
 MR. FISHER. inform us justification is.
 MR. SHEETS. Mexico experiencing increased financial stresses, particularly

 MR. FISHER. conditionality?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think fairly tough point. Vice
 Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. I’m favor. basic question would
 deal requests beyond four, Nathan gave two options. One delegate
 subcommittee discretion make judgments. second option say, “No, without
 coming back Committee.” think makes sense see IMF thing works
 received, much participation get, boundary problems signaling
 problem play out, probably good idea Committee least briefing
 playing context going forward. would favor
 delegating authority subcommittee, would expect be,
 sometimes judgments need made quickly. certainly understand people would
 want better sense unfolding deal it. boundary
 problems going get worse go broader this.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Duke.
 MS. DUKE. I’m favor.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. I’m favor Mr. Chairman, would also favor, terms screening

 MR. KOHN. I’m favor, Mr. Chairman. think boundary problems difficult.
 agree Vice Chairman IMF mitigates them. encouraged
 Nathan’s sense people interested IMF, might much stigma

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. I, too, favor facility. think it’s important tranching
 using somewhat different ways providing money countries
 countries because, President Bullard others mentioned, we’re careful,
 could used purposes comfortable. could used supporting
 currency, don’t think we’d particularly comfortable that. Obviously,
 realistic. Money fungible. large reserves. could using reserves
 purposes using swaps purposes find acceptable. think, given
 circumstances, makes sense coming something that’s complementary IMF
 facility make sure IMF facility facility together sufficient deal

 Finally, want point out, underscore basic point: going
 principally monetary policy going forward. look broad framework policies

 United States overseas. Corporate bond rates risk spreads may well fall

 wider historical norms throughout forecast period. think new spread relationships
 uncertain. thought would sort normal spreads LIBOR normal spreads
 corporate bonds, reassessed us also market participants. Even
 credit made available businesses new Treasury
 programs, suspect all-in cost capital likely materially impede business investment,
 particularly given expectations businesses weaker economy upcoming period.
 Vice Chairman Geithner suggested, monetary policy might able bit this,
 going able change much.
 Let turn three points economy closing. First, near term, given
 sense October tracking, it’s likely extraordinarily weak. expect weaker fourthquarter consumption Greenbook, weaker labor markets going 2009, materially
 weaker fourth-quarter GDP print. labor surveys—including preferred
 measures, like JOLTS—seem holding up; I’m sure that’s going hold
 another couple months. I’d expect labor markets trend materially direction
 I’ve discussed.
 Well, beyond near term? 2009 beyond? strikes
 catalysts marked improvement lacking. think fiscal policy, regulatory
 policy, tax policy, trade policy, talked previously, it’s obvious
 going provide kind catalyst marked change contour
 economy. fiscal front, assume fiscal stimulus likely larger, maybe even
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 103 206
 
 materially larger, Greenbook alternative simulation, conclusions similar
 Greenbook’s, I’m sure it’s going terribly effective. I’m sure it’s
 going constructed way, I’m sure nearly much inevitably
 advertised do. disturbing trend probably even efficacy fiscal package—
 view absolutely necessary, query whether it’s going structured
 way needs do—is potential output forecast period likely fall.
 Trend growth rates coming down, expect productivity fall perhaps even
 Greenbook projection. vaunted resilience U.S. economy, I’ve talked
 long time, certainly going tested period. Business investment, strikes me,
 useful gauge get first quarter 2009 see tough economic period
 front us, worry decisions business people making. Now,
 course, this, markets could snap back, saw little yesterday—2009 could look
 better. remain open minded possibility economy continue,
 past ten fifteen years, outperform model-based expectations.
 Let turn foreign growth. decouplers, prominent long,
 somehow hard find days. Foreign growth strikes likely fall faster stay lower
 Greenbook projection. road back likely begin early first quarter
 2009 major trading partners. “more financial fallout” alternative simulation strikes
 significantly likely foreign growth. light growth trajectory better
 United States outside United States, least relative current market expectations, I’d
 expect foreign exchange value dollar balance strengthen basket foreign
 currencies.
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 104 206
 
 let turn finally inflation. trend import prices, broad measures
 commodity prices, expected dollar strength suggest inflation problems abating
 markedly. think open question, isn’t likely dispositive likely
 interesting, sticky prices are, particularly consumer product companies
 period—how long various surcharges increases prices we’ve seen stay high
 companies attempt keep profit margins. guess make profit margins look
 decent another quarter two; beyond that, prices across broad set products services
 likely retrace gains recent periods. I’ll save balance remarks
 next round. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you. Well, autumnal bonfires really sort heated
 since last FOMC meeting. think evidence United States worldwide

 always say, it’s particularly difficult predict economy going go.
 there’s evidence it’s difficult almost measure volatility

 consumer confidence. think say confidence particularly

 spreads come down, given extent actions governments around
 world—central banks, fiscal authorities, et cetera—it surprising little

 Now, maybe it’s much going there’s fair amount confusion

 coming respect interbank borrowing—there lack clarity exactly

 think real uncertainty thirty days banks may get guarantees

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. Let try summarize heard
 today yesterday, I’ll try add new comments that. outlook
 economic growth appears deteriorated quite significantly since last meeting. Data
 consumer spending, production, employment weakened expected even

 conditions greatly worsened, risk aversion increased, despite actions
 abroad stabilize banking system. Equity values declined sharply amid conditions

 Credit market conditions improved modestly since global actions recapitalize

 However, almost credit markets, spreads remain much wider, maturities shorter,

 Deterioration global growth expectations marked. Industrial economies
 already shown signs slowing, hit hard recent financial developments.
 Emerging market economies, recently evidently much affected U.S. slowdown,
 recent weeks also hit hard spreading financial crisis. Together
 stronger dollar, developments likely restrain future growth U.S. exports.
 Inflation risks declined materially, reflecting fall prices energy

 report much reduced pricing power lower markups. Inflation expectations come down,
 surveys TIPS market, though wasn’t noted—but note—that

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher, promised answers, deliver

 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. strongly favor alternative A, 50 basis

 support alternative A. think inflation trends trends global economy give us
 flexibility, six months ago think would have. think gives us
 degree freedom that, given negative tone, including own, around table, gives us
 least source comfort.
 Next would say agree consensus around table,
 problems principally monetary policy. also think monetary policy isn’t
 irrelevant this, agencies governments around world making tough decisions,
 marginal benefits monetary policy changes strike high irrelevant.
 think President Plosser talked bit alternative policy paths Greenbook range

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank much. Well, I’ve able convince
 agree President Evans. everyone said, significant global shift
 stepped real activity financial activity. inflation environment changed
 dramatically number months ago change commodity prices, change
 value dollar, change U.S. also global resource utilization. think we’ve
 seen enormous change there. Also, look expected federal funds rate path—
 careful looking anything markets days liquidity, risk
 premiums, term premiums we’re quite sure about—the markets expecting significant
 cuts us. expecting immediate near-term significant increases inflation,
 think indications going down.
 cost–benefit analysis, costs seem relatively low terms potential inflation
 this. Now, think terms benefits, number people
 touched transmission mechanism. think forces mute extent
 50 basis point cut translates 50 basis points lower costs, don’t think
 completely offset it. still effect reducing cost liquidity, reducing many people’s
 borrowing costs. think still effect even there’s offsetting risk spread even

 there’s offsetting bank action affects that. terms costs benefits, time
 seems costs relatively low muted, benefits positive potentially high.
 particular, mentioned before, I’m concerned confluence forces may
 make things difficult around end year. look lot LIBOR
 forward markets, they’re coming either United States around world.
 lot uncertainties hedge funds, potential institutions getting

 stated earlier remarks, I’m also concerned importance

 expectations. recently expecter rather decider, I’m going suggest

 There’s thought that, fed funds rate comes down, would maybe make pain go
 away. agree Governor Warsh public statements intermeeting period
 approach point simply can’t meet market expectations anymore critically
 important shape market expectations. think it’s important markets focus
 efforts, would support alternative A.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, support alternative A, action
 language reasons said earlier. want make couple points. think
 way predictable crisis like predictably inert late. don’t
 understand basic argument add confidence inert late or,
 Chairman said, passive despite overwhelming evidence changes outlook
 risks financial stability. argument makes uncomfortable around table
 today suggestion several made—I’m sure meant way—which
 actions Committee contributed erosion confidence—a deeply unfair
 suggestion.
 Now, lot things happened last three months last year, lot things
 happened terms policy last six weeks. doubt communication
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 145 206
 
 policy arms U.S. government uncertainty created actions
 arms U.S. government contributed ways uncertainty policy response going
 forward. also doubt inevitably crisis like this, policy moves forcefully,
 scary lot people yet point assessing understanding forces
 driving decisions. think it’s unfair suggest actions Chairman
 Committee substantial contributor erosion confidence uncertainty
 policy actions, even though it’s true move force drama risk
 adding uncertainty.
 I’d careful look broadly full range things happened
 period time, including, example, confusion established range different
 choices interventions Lehman, AIG, GSEs, WaMu particular, Wachovia
 meant. Look particularly damage confidence created Congress’s actions
 weeks legislation first proposed. Compare that, example, announcement

 know, everyone wants quote FDR. FDR said one point, “If judge mood

 risks appropriately time, think owe substantial amount deference
 judgments made wisdom. room effect
 policy choices fiscal authorities also ultimately made look good look
 even better time people understand grave substantial risks
 facing economy financial system.
 One last point President Fisher’s question. President Fisher asked obvious question,
 is, next? think good approach decisionmaking say, “I don’t want
 know much this. want know next three things.” know Chairman
 going give nice, thoughtful, complete answer this. would say following:
 don’t need know today next monetary policy front. know may
 arguments going lower 1 percent. think carefully
 collateral damage consequence terms market functioning behavior.
 look alternatives that, including communication. range policy options
 within capacity influence effect give us ability minimize downside risk
 going forward. don’t think need know—and cannot know precision—what
 optimal mix things deciding do, although I’m sympathetic
 basic judgment. question really is, moving today, going harm

 require monetary policy address risk here.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. I’d like take moment react. I’m sure heard
 saying result primarily result Committee’s actions Chairman’s actions
 anyone else’s actions. words putting mouth, said,
 President Geithner. think supportive almost actions terms liquidity
 facilities; supported actions. also supportive Lehman Brothers decision.
 think it’s far cry saying uncertainty policies contributes uncertainty—which
 agreed to—it’s far cry saying lay blame feet Committee
 Chairman. don’t know straw man setting up, certainly didn’t apply
 member Committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. Let offer thoughts may
 somewhat expansive usual response questions raised.
 extemporaneous, you’ll bear me. Let first talk strategy
 pursued thus far think might go country well
 institution going forward.
 Without going familiar discussion crisis began,
 sources were, think Federal Reserve’s responses essentially three. First,
 relatively early aggressive monetary policy easing, particularly compared
 countries. Second, creative expansive use liquidity tools, including
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 148 206
 
 wide variety lending programs. Third, used available, always adequate, tools
 try stabilize systemically critical failing institutions try mitigate systemic risk.
 Without sounding defensive, try argue think three
 less right direction. First, early aggressive monetary policy easing,
 obviously lot concern—a lot expressed abroad going create
 stagflationary 1970s type situation going destroy dollar role
 international currency. response essentially thought increases
 commodity prices mostly relative price change induced changes real demand
 commodities supply commodities across globe that, point,
 commodity price increases would stabilize, would lead moderation inflationary
 effects concerns. took longer expected; began,
 pronounced expected. Inflation become problem anticipated
 many early on, dollar, course, stronger began cutting
 interest rates. retrospect, think monetary policy, although perfect certainly—and
 communication always perfect—broadly speaking appropriate given turned
 severe economic situation.
 Liquidity expansion also received criticism early on. view
 inducing moral hazard. also question whether effective approach.
 helped respect fact ECB joined us early type
 aggressive policy. don’t know counterfactual. obviously solved problems.
 think there’s strong perception markets general public actions
 supportive, helped mitigate effects crisis functioning
 financial system. feel comfortable also approach.

 heard recently Jackson Hole. never took seriously. don’t believe
 allow systemically critical institutions fail middle financial crises expect
 problem. don’t want get issue inconsistency. It’s true treated senior
 debt differently Fannie Freddie WaMu Wachovia, don’t think

 turned run. Companies like Wachovia adequate Basel capital faced run

 stabilize them, think run, panic, impact panic
 major institutions source intensification financial crisis. don’t buy
 argument stay business protecting financial system, think
 major factor was, fact, panic generated underlying uncertainties
 effect critical institutions.
 Also recently heard critique left, is,
 heck guys letting Lehman fail? interesting given critique
 one quite while. think critique unfair narrow level that, first, Lehman
 symptom well cause recent crisis and, second, Fed Treasury simply
 tools address Lehman companies stress time.
 think criticism appropriate, though, directed toward United States whole.

 have—as Europeans FDICIA banks—a system set
 allow reasonable responsible orderly resolution nonbank systemically critical institutions.
 think made lot progress there. TARP provide good interim solution.
 important future address too-big-to-fail problem have, find
 ways reduce problem, find ways deal systematically firms
 crisis. given fog war—which has, course, intense going back
 year—I would defend we’ve done terms general direction, acknowledging
 execution always perfect communication always perfect.
 Now, future? History suggests that, whenever financial crisis becomes
 sufficiently severe, ultimately solution fiscal solution, fiscal
 solution. two possibilities. One financial system muddle through,
 case fiscal solution sort we’ve already seen: injections capital, support
 critical firms, support credit markets general; Keynesian-style demand support. That’s
 one possibility. hope that’s we’re going be. testimony, argued
 try focus whatever stimulus solving underlying problems rather
 simply handing money could that, again, addressing credit markets. would
 add, foreclosure, homeownership, issues well. hope that’s
 fiscal policy be. hope take lead us going forward. Obviously, we’ll
 continue play supporting role lot different ways.
 possibility, course, things get much worse
 situation Sweden Japan, case massive recapitalization banking system
 necessary. eventually happen, note that, fiscal dynamics,
 political economy overlay. get point right policy induce
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 151 206
 
 fiscal support also politically possible. That’s one reason think TARP
 possible recent period. fact, barely possible recently. So, again, believe
 fiscal policy critical part solution going forward.
 Another part forget international response,
 beginning really become serious. responses G7 weekend banks bank
 guarantees important suggested commitment countries stabilize system.
 That’s important. think see aggressive monetary policy going forward, think
 we’ll see increasingly aggressive fiscal policy countries recognize
 decoupling longer realistic story. that’s going important well.
 respect Federal Reserve, generally speaking—and I’ll come back
 specific recommendation today—again, think liquidity provision
 constructive. allowed use balance sheet help push deleveraging process
 that’s going year. guess probably expand more,
 don’t see expanding lot more, reason reaching limits
 operational capacity well balance sheet capacity. think reasonably successful
 staying side liquidity provision straying credit taking credit risk. want
 stay side line legal reasons that’s way monetary policy
 lender-of-last-resort policy supposed work. Again, hope fiscal interventions
 able take away responsibilities us, we’ll see play
 out.
 confess hear President Plosser’s concerns reversing programs.

 monetary policy, think important us responsive. Even stipulate
 moment interest rate changes might make today minimal effect cost
 capital—and don’t necessarily agree that, let stipulate it—there still importance
 signaling we’re trying tell markets plan future.
 Frankly, don’t think try signal going stand pat,
 reluctant refuse move lower. prepared move low makes sense.
 mean part institutional factors affect efficacy monetary policy
 low interest rates. We’re aware that. asked yesterday, I’ll ask again, staff go
 back 2003 work, update it, think help us understand would call
 effective zero. real zero? zero? 50 basis points? 75 basis points?
 recognize go literal zero, would substantial effects number
 financial markets, would ask whether benefits worth
 dislocations. Japanese thought were, example, shut
 interbank market long time. Maybe worth that. decisions need
 make next meeting, opportunities talk together
 public well. think monetary policy needs proactive continue part
 solution going forward.
 today’s action? essentially accept general change outlook proposed
 Greenbook. Since last meeting effective tightening financial
 conditions, overwhelmed 50 basis point cut central banks.
 
 October 28–29, 2008

 outlook become much worse. important us act aggressively signal
 essentially we’re willing whatever necessary support recovery economy.
 lot talk confidence. think best thing confidence
 say we’re going whatever takes, even involves extraordinary actions, get
 economy back onto path begin grow reasonable way again. Signaling
 coyness, cute, safe strategy right now. need straightforward say
 we’re going takes. view, specific, 50 basis points right step
 today.
 Now, number concerns objections raised. Let address
 them. One President Bullard’s interesting presentation inflation trap, intuitively
 it’s clear that, given real interest rate, equilibrium high
 nominal rate high expected inflation rate low nominal rate deflation.
 things possible. trap Japan got into. obviously want
 avoid deflation trap. question is, avoid it? far see—obviously
 get this—the best two ways avoid are, first, President Lacker suggested,
 reaffirm commitment price stability defined 1½ 2 percent whatever Committee’s
 general view is. We’re going try projections potentially trial
 projection we’re doing, think continue strengthen commitment
 maintaining positive inflation rate. thing, terms dynamics, aggressive
 trying avoid getting deflationary situation, expectations move direction.
 don’t think deflation expectations arise spontaneously we’re cutting interest rates.
 think they’ll arise economy expected extremely weak, anything
 eliminate expectation view would helpful.
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 154 206
 
 second objection I’ve heard question whether actions effective.
 think effective. Maybe they’re effective normal circumstances, let
 put way. cut 50 basis points today LIBOR–OIS spread rises 50 basis
 points tomorrow, accept there’s problem. LIBOR spread doesn’t move much
 overall LIBOR drops 50 basis points, think we’re effect. look
 LIBOR past year, you’ll see dramatic decline even though spreads widened.
 don’t think argue we’re effect. extent we’re muted
 effect, well argue aggressive need
 get impact. understand concerns, reiterate, responding Governor Duke
 others, get low, side effects certain institutions financial
 markets. need understand those, that’s part decision process. don’t think it’s
 case monetary policy zero impact.
 third argument I’ve heard “keep power dry” argument. Unless think
 movements rate entirely psychological effect, don’t think that’s strong
 argument particular circumstance. Again, analyzed quite bit 2003 episode,
 general outcome literature simulations done staff—Dave
 Reifschneider, John Williams, others published research this—is best way
 avoid zero bound aggressive normal try avoid accumulation
 weakness try avoid getting trap. more-preemptive strategies are, fact,
 consistent we’ve done last year.
 recommendation today 50 basis points language alternative A.
 think least moderately beneficial terms psychology terms
 reducing cost funding giving additional support funding markets. hope
 
 October 28–29, 2008
 
 155 206
 
 remarks, somewhat extemporaneous, addressed extent
 future steps. ought, again, think hard next six weeks real zero
 implications going below, say, 75 basis points. ought make
 determination, may sit still December. may things improve quite
 bit markets, example. It’s possible. One advantage 50 today almost
 certainly anything intermeeting done significant step
 today. December we’ll able look situation. may able little
 nothing—it possible. decide action needed, point
 prepared decide regime going be, far we’re going go, effective
 zero is, think shouldn’t hesitate that’s situation calls for.
 think way forward. understand need withdraw policy actions
 appropriate time. don’t think focusing near term moment
 inconsistent fact point things reversed. So,
 questions comments? President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. First, would like thank you, Mr. Chairman, thorough

 MR. LACKER. Yes, also strongly support charge direction staff
