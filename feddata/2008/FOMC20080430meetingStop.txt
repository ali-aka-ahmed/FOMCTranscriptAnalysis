 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would like do—it probably
 come surprise—is make case stand pat today make
 change. case built number points, I’d like articulate best can.
 First, know, economic outlook weakened since start year,
 deterioration occurred largely January March. Since March meeting,
 little change Greenbook forecast outlook economy.
 Incoming data intermeeting period consistent weak first half
 appreciably weaker earlier anticipated. believe easing policy appropriate
 weaker economy, continuing cut rates long economy remains weak
 appropriate. Although difficult task, must try calibrate appropriate level
 fed funds rate economic prospects policy goals. note that, since last
 September, lowered funds rate 300 basis points. year alone, period less
 60 days, cut 200 basis points. aggressive policy easing.
 enough time passed, view, see full effect economy cuts,
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 107 266
 
 25 basis point cut funds rate point nothing change near-term
 outlook economy.
 Second, currently running accommodative monetary policy, matter
 look it. real funds rate negative negative, depending measures
 inflation use construct it. nominal funds rate level versions
 Taylor rule, even adjusting interest rate real rate effects, given
 objectives. noted yesterday, monetary aggregates measured M2 and, extent,
 MZM expanded rapidly, especially since rate cuts late January. Now, although
 none measures monetary accommodation monetary ease perfect—each
 drawbacks—I concerned measures monetary accommodation suggest
 accommodative current time.
 Third, inflation high, unacceptably high view, way

 expectations inflation remain anchored. since end last year, measures

 Clearly, oil prices commodity prices part relative price shock.
 question that. also true 1970s one mistakes

 April 29–30, 2008

 fall trap. Besides, think monetary models today worry
 particularly stabilizing core inflation represents sticky prices stickyprice models. relative price shocks begin seep core, sticky-price
 elements, monetary theory would suggest need respond those. going
 achieve something close optimal monetary policy, concerned seepage
 may affect expectations part monetary policy doing, least
 class models.
 Although true seen much way wage inflation date
 encouraging, would also reiterate, people noted yesterday, wage inflation
 tends lagging, leading, indicator overall inflation. Contrary Greenbook
 forecast, us maintaining negative real funds rate two years inflation coming
 down, think that, continue easing maintain real funds rate well zero
 period time despite inflation well goal, reasonable assume expectations
 remain anchored. FOMC’s stated goal price stability cannot remain credible
 independent actions. want expectations remain well anchored, act
 way consistent that.
 Fourth, believe fortunate position today able pause.
 Market participants reacted incoming data appreciably tightening
 expectations future funds rate moves—at least measured futures markets,
 seen. Participants seem getting less comfortable idea easy monetary policy
 sustained period, given outlook inflation. note markets’ reassessment
 policy expectations intermeeting period doesn’t appear significant
 negative effect markets, economy broadly, period. think
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 109 266
 
 reassessment markets presents us opportunity reinforce stated commitment
 price stability, words action or, case, inaction. think pause
 today would send strong signal commitment price stability, could help
 anchor inflation expectations, consider fragile. pause, seems me,
 balances risks two parts mandate. might argue that, midst
 financial market disruptions seen year, important Fed add
 market turmoil taking policy actions anticipated markets. mean expectation
 markets 25 basis points easing today. market participants placing odds
 somewhere 25 percent 30 percent pausing, don’t think pause would
 disruptive markets. magnitude surprise would
 surprise last time cut 75 basis points. surprise, view, really
 cause much turmoil marketplace.
 Finally, say cutting 25 basis points won’t help outlook economy
 much, others might respond cutting 25 basis points won’t hurt much either,
 not. disagree. think cut today disaster contribute
 eroding credibility eyes public. past meetings Committee spoken
 lot need rapid reversals rate cuts took insurance. think
 overly confident ability implement rapid reversals. fact,
 lower rates go, need come back start taking

 summary, mind gain credibility pausing today substantially

 pause relatively small disappointment. President Plosser pointed out,

 longer maintenance period might allow depository institutions scope

 however, whether aggregate quantity voluntary balance targets would
 large enough provide adequate leeway effective arbitrage across days
 maintenance period. Many banks might choose establish voluntary balance
 target system, may choose establish large balance

 corridor.
 Option 3. noted page 30, option 3 paper—the simple corridor—is
 similar systems employed Bank Canada Reserve Bank

 Option 4. noted page 31, option 4 paper system similar many
 respects employed Reserve Bank New Zealand. Key structural
 features system include asymmetric interest rate corridor relatively
 high level balances ensure funds rate trades near floor interest

 right. low levels balances, demand curve would downward sloping

 sufficiently high levels balances, risk overnight overdrafts become
 low, demand curve would asymptote near floor funds rate

 probably sufficient cases. principle, fluctuations various factors
 affecting reserves would much effect funds rate, generally
 high level balances could reduce daylight overdrafts. Partly
 experience New Zealand, questions incentives strategic
 behavior structure.
 Option 5. noted page 32, option 5 hybrid single-day system would
 involve voluntary daily balance target relatively wide target band.
 Depositories would receive full remuneration balances maintained upper
 bound target band would penalized shortfall balances
 lower bound target band. structural elements, reserve
 demand curve fairly flat target rate wide range, curve

 Let sum outlining five options stack four
 objectives established new operating framework,
 summarized pages 40 41. First, options would eliminate
 current “reserve tax” associated nonpayment interest reserves,
 perhaps exception option 1, would reduce administrative burdens

 (floor high balances) would eliminate administrative costs.

 Second, options would improve monetary policy implementation
 helping set floor fed funds rate. additional features could
 help control rate volatility, although differ one another terms
 mechanics. options offer greater potential adjust parameters
 ways could helpful amid changing circumstances—say, periods
 market stress heightened uncertainty developments could affect
 balance sheet. adjustable clearing band option 5 could offer considerable
 flexibility. Adjustable reserve targets, feature options 2 5, another
 possibility.
 Third, options would rely efficient money markets distributing
 reserves DIs. uncertainty, however,
 options might influence incentive structure trading allocation
 liquidity short-term financing markets role central bank
 process. case option 3 (simple corridor), corridor
 narrow, option 4 (floor high balances), choices lending

 equivalent.
 Fourth, options compatible proposed changes payment
 system policies. However, differences among options levels
 reserves would likely place could serve substitute
 provision central bank daylight credit. Option 4 (floor high balances) would
 provide reserves system, option 3 (simple corridor) would provide
 fewest, perhaps even lower current levels. system voluntary reserve
 targets, feature options 2 5, could deliberately designed encourage
 relatively high level reserves.

 Put generally, effectiveness market isn’t quantity transactions.
 bring one main objections option 4, least report—it didn’t

 Option 1 easiest one. enough information it, that’s fine. think
 that’s have.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. two comments. would drop option 1. think doesn’t
 enough reduce burdens dead weight losses. long it’s there,
 tendency fall back sorts reasons, given bureaucratic tendencies. would
 discard it. would discard option 4, would include options 2, 4, 5. originally
 attracted 4. read reservations report thought, okay, it’s worth pursuing.
 listened President Lacker, reconvinced significant merits
 there.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you. First, really appreciate excellent work staff
 done topic. really learned lot papers. thought clear
 comprehensive. couple comments questions Bill Brian
 raised memo. first one whether agree objectives,
 couple issues.
 First, think stated objective reducing burdens dead weight losses
 associated current reserve tax narrowly framed paper. starting point is,
 burden, cover given program government spending, Treasury obtain
 revenue source, nondistortionary lump-sum taxes one available
 options. real question public finance standpoint tax much.
 means, mind, issue magnitude welfare gains would
 come lowering dead weight loss due implicit tax reserves compares
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 178 266
 
 additional dead weight losses would result alternative taxes would
 raised make lost revenue. answer depends part interest elasticity
 demand reserves, believe. think case that, interest elasticity relatively
 small, dead weight loss reserve tax relatively small, net welfare gain,
 taking account burdens raising taxes make lost seigniorage,
 effect, could easily turn negative.
 Let give example comes play. well-known paper
 Martin Feldstein looks benefits moving price stability, zero inflation,
 favors. looks issue context, concludes would net
 social losses, gains, reduction seigniorage would associated move
 zero inflation positive inflation dead weight loss due shoe-leather cost,
 also known Bailey effect, smaller dead weight losses would associated
 alternative taxes. analysis taxes labor supply saving. actually think
 serious problem framing objectives paper. is, effect,
 saying, “We think give tax cut. think give banks, think
 that, welfare loss—a Harberger triangle—associated that, clear
 welfare gain.” Now, pretending know exactly would come out,
 think that’s issue. come net loss, gain, possible
 implication fallback option 1—I’m saying favor option 1—
 could case paying interest required reserves rather paying interest
 federal funds rate paying interest excess reserves rate would determine.
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 179 266
 
 administrative costs voluntary target balances, seems
 paper, come it, ought try least estimate administrative
 burdens associated options 2 5 would be.
 Another comment issue objectives: coming white paper,
 seems objective everybody discussing discussed—
 namely, paying interest reserves would enable us expand size balance sheet
 times financial crisis, like now, perhaps greatly enhance scope liquidity-altering
 interventions would possible without push federal funds rate zero—is
 real improvement tool kit available us address market disruptions. would see
 advantage paying interest reserves. discussing right
 Congress much discussed press, think kind odd come paper
 doesn’t even mention it. Maybe disadvantages advantages.
 seems there.
 Also, would say question options 2 5 versus options 3 4,
 advantage paper attaches voluntary targets ability moderate
 volatility federal funds rate. seem that—I understand may
 difficult—the possibility intervening multiple times day alternative,
 possible change procedures could multiple interventions reduce
 volatility, would mean 3 4 could table, might less burden
 associated those. think possibility deserves least careful consideration.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Bullard.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. proposal study. timeline
 seems fine me. study period pretty important case clear
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 180 266
 
 option best, think maybe keep options table. One
 question is, extent current reserve requirements actually binding
 depository institutions? past study St. Louis staff—Dick Anderson Bob
 Rasche—suggesting that, large, existing reserve requirements binding.
 calls question whether objective 1 study group really appropriate. Dead
 weight losses make sense binding reserve requirement. regard, I’d
 like endorse President Yellen’s comment, thought right target, whether
 going make lost revenue somewhere else distortionary
 would be. bit political risk that, starts get painted handout
 banks, maybe wouldn’t serve us well.
 would like see emphasis option 3, based discussion seems
 bad system. Canadian system. tested system economy
 different own—certainly, economy closely integrated one.
 corridor would narrow. might volatility within corridor, still
 seem get pretty good results. know small number banks, seems
 today’s technology might able get good read even large economy. would
 like see kept mix here. lots success low administrative
 burden, worried about. perhaps familiar options 2 5,
 favored options discussion. concerned language
 voluntary balance targets, seem maybe voluntary. seems create
 risk systems really market-oriented would like see could
 manipulated market participants, particularly time stress.
 concerns this.
 
 April 29–30, 2008

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. public finance question, course, Congress
 acted score cost. sense moot perspective. President
 Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let also start commending
 authors papers prepared topic. found material informative
 helpful. agree objectives established staff evaluate set proposals,
 also support process proposed timeline moving proposals forward. think
 good timeline provides comments banks early process.
 important us receive input early stage.
 found option 2 preferable option 1 option 2, discussed,
 clearly reduces administrative burdens relative option 1. think option 3 leaves
 much potential fed funds rate volatility corridor. also intrigued option 4
 caps. However, ultimately rejected option 4 concern might lead less
 robust interbank lending market. given comments President Lacker others,
 perhaps makes sense keep option 4 table. end, however, comfortable
 moving forward focus options 2 5. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lockhart.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. answer questions
 posed, comfortable options 2 5, thought President Lacker’s presentation
 made case option 4 deserves remain mix. think objectives appropriate.
 comment have—and bit vague, realize—is ensure thinking far
 enough ahead ensure durable system operate different mixes
 private public payment system. Certainly, think conceivable years
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 182 266
 
 business retail payments, think address different mixes
 private public payment systems.
 Regarding timeline, Governor Kohn already asked question approaching
 Congress accelerate. Assuming approach Congress accelerate this,
 timeline seems quite comfortable gives plenty time careful
 consideration.
 room Roberds research staff, chance Bank
 England talking experiences recently. thought would share couple things
 apropos. tried maintenance periods intermeeting period,
 found effective, apparently ambiguity around target rate.
 useful way thinking—that maintenance periods would designed around
 intermeeting period. apparently tried option 3, didn’t work much
 volatility within corridor. two tidbits feedback visit member
 staff Bank England. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would look meeting
 introduction topic, given breadth discussion here, found extremely
 interesting useful. think need come back another discussion it—not
 necessarily another 100-page study. wouldn’t want put burden you—it might
 negate savings get project. [Laughter]
 point options, one attractive option 2.
 good transition. familiarity it, given way clearing balances now,
 think work it. reason little questioning option 1
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 183 266
 
 option 2 quite sure going end with, given banks may
 choose target amount reserves forth. choice make, going
 go learning curve. those, prefer option 2. fascinated, though,
 President Lacker’s comments option 4 look mind
 thought made good points. moment, think option 2 pretty good path
 go down.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. brief. Option 2 looks
 attractive me. think option 1 may fallback position, like President Stern, given
 tendency move slow quickly, makes sense, would rather take opportunity
 make larger step. think option 2 fine. Option 5 interesting, distinction
 nobody else really that. would little wild card terms
 might implement might work. think merit.
 asked Bill Dudley back fall, trouble meeting endof-day targets, didn’t set price. answer got was, “Well, good
 time think option context paying interest reserves.” probably
 little disappointed didn’t see strategy might look like
 would behave. Thanks President Lacker, interpretation option 4 pushing us
 direction. hadn’t really thought option 4 context way, like it. still
 view essentially looking everything quantity-based view go
 restricts way think options might be. would like see
 little explanation price target, buy sell, might actually do.
 might interact option 4 would interesting way enrich set options.
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 184 266
 
 Another question had—and don’t know answer this—is instituted
 number new facilities. TAF, TSLF, forth. wasn’t quite clear
 facilities would interact appropriate inappropriate within context
 things, whether would substitute sense. wanted pull
 shelf future time, would interact systems? think
 would useful little discussion interactions might be.
 last observation related President Lockhart’s comment. go
 paying interest reserves implications parts Federal Reserve System
 does—in particular retail payment system way calculate cost recoveries
 revenues Monetary Control Act. separate study groups
 thinking this, ought make sure tie pieces together go forward
 know domino effects going direction might be. Maybe
 concern, get retail payments, affects Monetary Control Act
 requirements fees services things like that. would like see loop closed
 somehow end discussion. Otherwise, want congratulate staff
 thorough report. conference well February. thought interesting,
 applaud staff good work. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, favor paying interest reserves
 time. excellent paper. Like everybody else, learned great deal
 papers sent superb summary presented. personally tend toward
 option 2, think worthwhile considering options 4 5 well terms vetting
 timetable. think Charlie asked good question relates
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 185 266
 
 facilities, generally, optics favorable. Again, moving forward.
 public doesn’t really understand background this—where Congress stood
 achieved far. think would one good thing us modernizing
 Federal Reserve.
 asked question governance understand current plan calls
 rates adjust automatically changes target set FOMC. would want make
 sure case. words, don’t like potential vesting power
 Board; and, course, potential there. think worth preserving federal system
 Federal Reserve. reservation have. comments. Thank you,
 Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. don’t want it. [Laughter] Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. thought great piece work
 staff, thank all. good job organizing laying general
 principles way people understand. Despite President Yellen’s comments,
 regrets testimony favor paying interest, perhaps bore much
 administrative costs years [laughter]—along Stephanie Martin
 predecessors Legal Division. costs borne considerable, addition
 dead weight losses.
 think consider options 2 5 sure. option 4, think need
 understand bit—other people said this—what third objective, “promoting efficient
 resilient money markets,” means exactly, entailed, would intersect
 option 4. think needs fleshed little more. planned get
 white paper soon, think perhaps including option 4 would easier including it,
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 186 266
 
 get people’s comments. Perhaps administrative burden experience,
 would like see reserve requirements zero, ruling option 1. option 3, don’t
 think, least system periods crisis, top band would hold,
 don’t think option would really work well. Thank work.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let add plaudits already
 expressed quality work, let confine comments timing
 sequencing. First, respect rollout white paper, strikes that, given
 questions raised flexibility around balance sheet tools
 event continued problems financial markets, need cognizant paper
 discussion might read, context long Fed effort get interest
 reserves perhaps solely responsive perceived burdens
 balance sheet flexibility. sensitive white paper read rolled out.
 broadly, timing—come fall, event decide collectively go
 Congress seeking authority respect PDCF, investment banks, things
 might might concluded, even though timeline makes lot sense, might
 good stead fairly good sense conclusions ultimately come,
 even exhaustive Fed rigor isn’t complete time. real benefit
 accelerating new authority late 2011 earlier period, could put
 context broader asks us expectation might get traction
 there. sort secondary timeline, option value come fall strikes useful.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 187 266
 
 MR. KROSZNER. Thanks. Great work, great presentation. impressive get
 fifty-two pages less fifty-two minutes, applaud that. Basically
 agree lot stuff said before. trick may thinking bit creatively
 stigma issues, way deal those. quite sure
 suggesting putting white paper comment—options 2, 5, possibly 4?
 thinking putting five out?
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, certainly think point three mentioned first.
 stage, going go three, might want think putting five
 out, flesh parts spectrum acknowledge option 1 could fallback.
 think pros cons that, certainly three point
 consensus seems be.
 MR. KROSZNER. three seems perfectly reasonable. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. comfortable analysis approach, don’t
 major comments there. Although white paper might mention them, would
 like take options 1 3 table. Option 1 much administrative burden.
 enough tsuris already. Although option 3 may work well countries different
 structures banking system, don’t think feasible alternative us. think
 look options 2 5, certainly comfortable another look option 4.
 One issue worry bit markets sort interbank credit
 risk issues. don’t want lose that, aware it. also worry bit
 setting price credit risk element it. credit risk
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 188 266
 
 element—if want set Treasury bill rate—it big deal. may issue
 there, sure, one considerations context. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman. Oh, sorry. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Presumably, rate pay would viewed risk-free rate.
 Presumably, market rate would priced relative include credit premium
 usual way. dynamics anticipated staff, would useful know that.
 usual presumption observed market rates would rate plus
 credit premium booked it, transaction costs, whatever. I’d make comment.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. don’t conviction
 yet options, agree narrow focus options 2 4-5. think
 design process tries force us get conviction quickly option
 would prefer. think possible. made huge investment already. know
 alternatives. think worth, again, goal gets us conviction quickly, part
 brief window might able get Congress
 accelerate could implement quickly. would get Congress accelerate
 could totally confident would free, would pay price, would
 risk anything else would table would compromise
 objective. hard confidence that. get confidence that,
 would go it. would certainly run process get conviction early.
 would want us conviction go public comment. general
 rule figure want design process maximizes chance
 get quickly. also strikes process drawn take much staff time.
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 189 266
 
 guys busy. don’t lot time. don’t lot excess capital
 Federal Reserve System relative challenges face. longer drawn out,
 maybe smaller tax day day, week week, huge tax. would want
 go public comment white paper time frame knew two things. One
 is, going get Congress accelerate? so, what? probability?
 going ask it? wouldn’t knew closer saying,
 “If got it, would time frame.”
 Finally, think hard discussion public Congress without
 answer perceive larger questions. larger questions?
 think reduce larger questions simply to, going
 role lender last resort going forward? version President Plosser’s
 Governor Warsh’s questions—what future facilities is, sense. staff
 assured options preserve optionality future facility framework.
 don’t prejudice options, important. think demand
 interest answer broader questions. hard see architecture
 role lender last resort without answer framework
 restraints risk-taking institutions access normal times extremis
 lender last resort facilities.
 can’t get conviction time frame need accelerate
 legislation stuff, but—and probably because—I think things fundamentally
 important whether end 2 4.5 5 way 4.5. would try
 shorten amount time effort put this, would increase amount time
 effort put broader set policy questions, going essentially
 
 April 29–30, 2008
 
 190 266
 
 intersection among lender last resort role, monetary policy regime, moral
 hazard consequences stuff done, deal future.
 think going take lot time, effort, care.
 don’t know reconcile said context practical path
 forward, except repeat it. try run process get conviction
 quickly relatively small set adjustments operate? Try get judgment
 quickly whether get Congress accelerate without meaningful political
 cost, design process whereby put position implement early next
 year, Congress accelerate. try resources saved attenuating
 process devoted deeper questions future facilities associated
 constraints going put broader set institutions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. broader questions, Vice Chairman,
 going talk lunch initiatives address
 broader regulatory bank supervision issues. process parallel this.
 would say issue that, go forward, keep mind possibility
 might want go Congress kind interim power. Obviously, things
 full panoply things described today. would
 interim steps, think important thing make sure whatever ask
 would inconsistent contradictory longer-term plans. obviously
 don’t anticipate implementing option 5 next year, could take interim steps
 potentially might useful current circumstances.
 briefly, agree President Fisher President Lacker. once-in-ageneration chance modernize system. relic use quantity-based

 management federal funds rate. think option 1 fallback can’t make
 something else work, try hard see find system let us
 manage funds rate tightly, even balance sheet expands contracts, on.
 concerns option 3, might tie fed funds rate much.
 Options 2 5 interesting. agree President Lacker option 4 worth exploring.
 broached staff meeting. Option 4 seems lot like Friedman’s optimum
 quantity money: throw money transaction cost margin zero.
 That’s basically is. don’t, frankly, fully understand implications would
 federal funds market—whether federal funds market shoe-leather cost whether
 actually useful functions, including price discovery, credit risk management,
 counterparty discipline. may functions market important,
 even still existed, liquidity greatly reduced wasn’t functioning
 normal way, could question. mind, main question understand
 think option 4. again, terrific work, really exciting, interesting stuff.
 thank much. comments interest reserves?
 Okay. not, let’s see. First, again, projections due Thursday 5:00 p.m.
 anyone changes, please make effort that. circulating information
