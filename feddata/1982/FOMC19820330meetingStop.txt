 So, wondered figures would

 give idea, that's almost exactly 1974-75

 1979, 18-1/2 percent 1978, 17-1/2 percent 1977.
 So, it's
 much smaller flow funds credit users typical.
 It's typical deep recession continues typical deep

 MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, expressed earlier,

 It's also responsibility sense permitted
 rather substantial increase interest rates right middle

 line argument Chuck developed. really something
 very, unusual going growth M1 it's currently
 measured.
 put point different way:
 true one

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. may interject. There's one
 factor hasn't mentioned, want mention
 sake completeness.
 think it's probably largely liquidity
 preference.
 Part may plain bad seasonal. may
 know seasonally adjust OCDs. maybe distribution
 really different think is.
 MR. GRAMLEY. think growth M1 since last October
 greatly overstated extent monetary policy
 stimulating economy. Another factor convinces
 case looking prospective growth rates, fourth
 quarter-to-first quarter, various monetary aggregates.
 Although less disparate less unusual fourth quarter-toFebruary numbers, still show progressive decline growth

 -43-
 
 3/29-30/82
 
 don't think alternative restrictive "A"

 I'd remind you,
 looking alternatives B C, M2 figures B C

 So, think alternative ought go.

 MR. ROOS.
 Mr. Chairman, I'd ask one question,
 I'm lost argument concerning effect accounts.
 accounts part M1, not?
 are, money

 It's different name different type

 lost
 that.
 trying figure total M1 trying

 MR. PARTEE.
 It's mixed account, Larry.
 savings account it, too.
 MR. ROOS.

 Yes, money bank and--
 
 MR. PARTEE.
 Well, money would

 MR. MORRIS.
 Another answer Larry's question
 present growth ranges M1 fundamentally based old M1.
 is, wanted show progressively shrinking number.
 fact new M1 different animal old M1.

 applying old M1 yardstick something different
 old M1.
 that's source problem.
 MR. ROOS.
 So, saying original targets
 set differently would known M1
 
 -44-
 
 3/29-30/82
 
 going expanded advent accounts?
 that's a-MR. MORRIS.
 
 think
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. WALLICH. M1 could also influenced things
 change velocity.
 We've often deceived
 underestimating velocity gains overestimating them. right
 see ahead us two sources velocity gain. One
 continued money fund expansion; sweeps.
 can't sure
 we'll get velocity, think it's less dangerous bet
 bet opposite.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Corrigan.

 going along 13-1/2 percent 13-1/4 percent interest rate,

 economy back work.
 Given alternatives wide division

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Boehne.

 MR. BOEHNE. good bit talk earlier

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. KEEHN. admit significant bias caused

 I'm way suggesting major change
 it, think
 provide least modest degree relief, seems
 alternative way that.
 would strongly
 favor alternative way trying accommodate possible
 bulge could occur April, particularly M2
 reasonable position within range.
 So, would much
 favor alternative A.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES. Well, Mr. Chairman, listen dialogue
 debate, one thing seems stand loud clear far many
 us concerned. think Frank expressed others
 followed:
 observed money supply really overstated
 effective money supply, given fact much growth
 since November come accounts OCDs. Therefore,
 would join would much hurry lean
 kind bulge.
 responding tactical question
 Steve posed Committee long continue let
 M1 run range year, bulge come regular
 demand deposits, I'd side fence.
 since
 didn't since April bulge equally mysterious
 while, would hurry lean hard
 solid information we're really doing.

 expressed pretty forcefully earlier urgency
 getting real interest rates down. can't much long rates.
 going solution depends major
 efforts get budget deficit down.
 think
 
 3/29-30/82
 
 -47-
 
 something short run short-term interest rates. I'm
 really quite concerned immediate future, unless
 short rates come down, going inhibiting seriously
 aborting prospective recovery. nets
 would lean somewhere "A" "B" terms ought
 March-to-June period. others suggested,
 I'd place emphasis M2 view low visibility
 going meaning M1 figures, particularly
 move April. say, I'd much hurry get
 back within range get better information
 true effective money supply is, based changing behavior [and]
 content.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Rice.
 
 MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, Governor Partee stated
 don't anything
 case alternative well, thought.
 really add that.
 would like remind everyone
 thought heard Mr. Axilrod say alternatives C B
 assume accounts precautionary balances whatever

 want call going work soon.
 don't, likely implied risk
 obstacle recovery.
 don't think ought take risk.
 don't need take risk think we'd leave
 position flexible adopt alternative A.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Roos.
 
 MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, stated prior recess,
 decisions make today made context
 mean policy second half year. looking
 this, don't think take lightly targets
 announced.
 don't think assume glibly arbitrarily
 adjust targets upward make July adjustment without
 risking perception market participants action paving
 way toward inflation. made upward adjustment
 order bring relief economy, would assume would
 exactly opposite effect proponents might
 seeking; upward adjustment annual ranges would probably
 bring upward movement interest rates rather reduction
 interest rates.
 So, would opt something like alternative B
 think would position us probably well could anticipate
 present difficult circumstances.
 feel
 strongly anyone could feel temporize,
 April bulge say don't want mechanistic [in
 responding it] however phrase it, going get
 position going live

 unacceptably fast growth M1 first part year.
 look day day week week, so,
 occasionally past, validate increase
 don't take action pinch pinch awfully quickly,
 think going jam brakes second half
 year. going bring us negative reaction terms
 economic activity later year early next year
 accused precipitated another recession. Regardless
 want view explain it--and nobody skillful
 
 3/29-30/82
 
 are, Mr. Chairman, explaining confusion arises
 accounts sweep accounts financial innovations--the
 people set interest rates eye M1.
 can't fool saying, well, M1 performed way
 M2 performed way. runs locomotive
 think recognize things.
 that's would
 disagree say shouldn't respond quickly
 bulge occurs. think incumbent upon us react quickly.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Governor Partee additional comment.
 
 MR. PARTEE. Well, yes.
 Larry, don't regard target
 year set stone.
 think circumstances
 would prepared shift target. said
 account dominance continues find ourselves, let's
 say next meet, looking sustained 30 percent rate
 increase accounts something like that, think would
 time consider whether make adjustment
 targets year, based unexpected strength accounts
 --not M1 generally, account performance--because
 kind precautionary development. Now, I'm inclined think
 [the bulge] going come out.
 can't understand people
 would keep much money accounts 5 percent interest
 get substantially almost alternative
 could go into.
 Or, Paul may right; seasonal may bad,
 would bring too. is, seasonal wrong
 first part year, definition wrong later
 we'll see weakness accounts.
 could
 sweep accounts develop we'll get observed slowing
 Ml sweeps taking money accounts.
 don't want
 prejudge point I'd say fact
 accounts continue perform far year I, one,
 think
 certainly would prepared change targets.
 Chairman could readily state changed targets.

 would eased unexpected
 development regard accounts. kind
 freedom we're slavishly stuck numbers whose contents don't
 know.
 One comment would like make rather agree
 thought ought use M2 information
 device. I'm still concerned don't good handle
 information M2 giving us.
 looks going
 pay attention M2 period ahead
 period past, would like staff begin develop
 rationale, far totally lacking, using M2 guide.
 [We need information on] kind cyclical attributes interest
 rates elasticity attributes M2 would have.
 think need
 really rely it, don't know
 behavior number [means] short run.
 MR. ROOS.
 studies recent studies made-not studies necessarily inclusive conclusive-that show M2 much inferior predictor economic activity
 M1 can't control it.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, course, people maintain
 opposite:
 M2 better predictor.
 think last
 
 3/29-30/82
 
 -49-
 
 study associated showed got little additional
 information added M2 components M1.
 don't know
 changed much.
 M1 deteriorating, think,
 may we'll rationale using M2.
 There's
 reason can't developed.
 all, found
 didn't much hit Federal Reserve head with,
 Milton Friedman M2; it's recently changed
 M1.
 Could ask Steve repeat proposal
 MS. TEETERS.
 might use M2?
 don't think understood it.
 MR. AXILROD. Well, suggesting M1
 running strong relative 8 10 percent think makes
 rough allowance possibly peculiar behavior April,
 Committee might consider effect adjusting reserve paths
 happening M2 running strong--if running
 right around top range something close
 now. hand, also thought
 uncertainties April, M1 running weak, might simply mean
 make good seasonal adjustment; may want
 react that. Then, too, could take account behavior
 M2 and, M2 also running weak, might mean money
 supply whole could considered running weak relative
 basic objectives.
 I'm suggesting using M2 kind fly wheel
 help judge behavior whole group aggregates, given
 uncertainty M1 April May.
 MS. TEETERS. read first quarter,
 tremendous increase M1 associated increase M2
 strong. correct?
 MR. AXILROD. Well, pretty good growth.
 may
 slightly number, it's something like 9-1/2 percent
 quarterly average basis.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's little high quarterly
 average basis. look December-to-March basis, it's
 top range.
 MR. AXILROD.
 would 9 percent December March;
 it's running right top range.
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. haven't heard Mr. Boykin Mr.
 Morris terms specifics.
 MR. BOYKIN.
 Well, Mr. Chairman, would favor alternative B.
 Given uncertainties don't know April
 don't know accounts many things, alternative B
 would seem represent prudent course would least
 position us address situation becomes clarified without
 abrupt change direction. respect conversation
 change ranges, seems change
 forthright decision opposed de facto working
 So, point
 direction, think alternative might do.
 time least, alternative B seems prudent place be.

 Anyhow, great variety opinion.

 course year whole we've anticipating growth

 uncertainties M1, given doubts economy, would
 feel comfortable tightening effect chase hard

 that's going case; reason believe

 So,

 I'm sure I'd want push M1; it's
