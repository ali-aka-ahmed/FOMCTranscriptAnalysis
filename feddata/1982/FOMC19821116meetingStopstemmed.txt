 go 2 percent, respons somewhat
 proport m1 togeth nontransact compon
 would roughli [as variabl m1].
 presid black point
 out, short run clearli won't be; interest rate go up,
 market rais rate nontransact compon
 respond.
 so, short run probabl ought react, [in
 effect,] move reserv requir demand deposit.

 is, m2 strong, realli practic option lower demand
 deposit substanti; we'd us demand deposit ratio
 multipli--for purpos [technic] adjust [to
 nonborrow reserv path]--rather m2 ratio.

 compon would requir substanti rise interest rate.
 that's anoth wai sai technic jargon
 interest elast m2 low rel interest elast

 so, try control m2 short-run period risk

 that's
 reason start us 2 percent ratio--to moder
