 Therefore, justified

 So, we're
 talking Fund money disbursed middle

 bank money talked presumably would wait

 that's temporary money; don't know terms would be.
 It's
 clear Mexico going need money next year--not
 Fund money, largely go repay short-term official
 assistance, money survive period time next
 year. take another negotiation initial $1
