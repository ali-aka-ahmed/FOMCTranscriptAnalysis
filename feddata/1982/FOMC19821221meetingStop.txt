 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, happy background, Mr.

 MR. AXILROD. Well, Mr. Chairman, Committee's decision

 might better bypass M1 least transition period.
 Now, said that, group whole felt--and would

 So, even

 therefore, would behave differently old M1, would

 That's saying, course, new M1 could like

 So, reasons given memo don't need

 Looking immediate problem, context providing

 Since figure initially given probably accommodate

 M2 probably best target use.

 little definite. probably going buy
 view point, I'd like see kind commitment

 favor two reasons.
 One

 I'd feel little better bumped

 Well, one point.
 interest elasticity M2
 less M1, probably be, elasticity
 M1 less past innovation,
 think necessarily would larger movements
 interest rates we've willing tolerate, we're going

 So, things

 One,
 basis research done Board, use
 intermediate targets inefficient better

 including political one, something one ought

 nothing paper exchange rates.
 Again, don't think
 exchange rates proper target economy, targets

 something think about.
 would think certainly
 exchange rates might play greater role targeting
 future have. little sentence [on them]
 directive much attention paid them. Finally,
 reference nominal GNP. may recall Martin Feldstein came
 weeks ago gave us talk recommending target
 that.
 think that's dangerous advice.

 think
 M1, share points made paper.
 wait see use it, becomes viable again.
 hear market money market deposit accounts

 Certainly M1 one element money supply targeting

 interest rate
 targeting, rejected paper, way feel

 difficulties.
 great difficulty, course, deciding
 right rate would difficult sustain

 rates, money, one sense better target directly
 interest rates target money let money determine
 interest rates.
 Well, come doable, think M2 best bet
 short run. keep flexible wide range
 around it.
 attractive sense trying control
 produces large changes interest rates control economy
 effectively even though control M2 aggregate
 effectively. may accept considerable deviations.

 base, think, perhaps deserves little support we've given
 here, particularly nonborrowed base.
 Fundamentally, course,
 base currency it's hard believe economy runs
 currency. However, currency best behaved variable
 it's one least known!

 So, find lot conflict

 target something predictably related
 GNP, M1 past two years, one two things

 MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, think one helpful comment
