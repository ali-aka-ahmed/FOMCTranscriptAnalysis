 strategy 2
 highest inflation highest money growth, would expect.
 also somehow get lowest interest rates it;
 that's part puzzles me. would explain that?
 MR. PRELL. Well, lags relationships,
 course. within time period, essence we're getting
 movement demand money curve.
 money
 people hold lower interest rates.
 So, within time
 span, hold interest rates down. also produces
 stronger performance economy, tighter labor markets,
 greater cost pressures prices.
 think clear
 consistency. Now, perhaps someone believes rational

 Well,

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Balles.
 
 MR. BALLES.
 I'd like ask Jim question

 MR. KICHLINE. Well, did, many alternatives

 MR. PARTEE. You're talking real rates building 10

 MR. KICHLINE.
 
 Well, Governor Wallich would say,
 
 taxes-MR. PARTEE.

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

 MR. BALLES.
 Another question tighter fiscal policy
 assumption:
 translate, this, Mike
 Prell's chart Treasury borrowings percent total
 funds raised?
 chart shows percentage shooting 40
 percent 1983.
 Would get significant relief
 tighter scenario crowding-out phenomenon I'm quite
 afraid of?
 MR. KICHLINE. borrowing tighter
 alternative would drop $45 billion, 10 percent
 total funds raised.
 would make substantial difference
 terms federal borrowing share total funds available.
 MR. CORRIGAN. Let pick up, John, may, point
 Tony started get at.
 think there's natural coincidence
 conversation downside phenomenon here, real/nominal
 interest rate issue strikes something really may cut
 way, even it's realm possibility. look
 numbers here, basically, nominal interest rates
 unchanged 1981 1983.
 that's true whether it's
 mortgage rates bill rates.
 time,
 time frame sharp change measured rate inflation,
 ending 5.7 percent something like 1983.

 question is:
 Isn't least conceivable, everything else equal,
 could end quite different nominal interest rates,

 Mike's

 Now, wouldn't project it, isn't clearly
 [possibility that], things worked little differently, could

 One that,
 MR. PRELL. I'd make couple observations.
 course, outcome flows outcome supply demand.
 one things holding flow basic

 MR. FORD. Well, may, question
 rest asking:

 strategy others--certainly 3 times high
 strategy 2 1984.
 MR. PRELL. Well, short-term rate interest.
 don't think there's clear evidence one models demand

 briefly, reason that,
 looked back last July, hadn't known weakness
 emerging economy.
 expected--I think
 now--the prospect downward shift demand money,
 downward shift seems slowed pretty considerably.
 Whether resume go 1982 remains seen.
 given fact fairly serious recession
 hadn't really anticipated July, given fact demand
 money longer shifting downward much--and maybe
 all--as compared last summer, given fact 2-1/2
 percent lower band would seem pretty Draconian right middle
 recession terms public announcement effects, believe
 would better advised use 3 5-1/2 percent range.
 would
 virtue uniform across board; upper end,
 lower end, midpoint [of M1 range] would 1/2 point

 would continue credibility

 presumption, growth would 4-1/4 percent.
 4-1/4 percent
 pretty healthy decline actual observed M1-B growth 5

 So, although supported tentative decision

 Mr. Chairman, think Steve addressed

 So, say there's small

 MR. GRAMLEY. Unless we're awfully lucky, I'm afraid
 growth rates going permit economy anything like

 think seriously something give economy

 Mr. Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. established preliminary targets
 last July, I'd reluctant make change time
 unless good supportable reasons doing. I'm
 unpersuaded I've heard today that, regard M1, change

 seems environment
 absolutely everything carefully scrutinized we'd
 supportable reasons making change. change upward
 would inappropriate, particularly given economic forecast

 Therefore, I'd favor leaving M1 target

 Therefore, would

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 Mr. Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, three points, probably none
 prevail.
 first would raise lower

 Peter, may ask question?
 MR. ROOS.
 staff usually gives us several alternatives short-run targets
 also indicates implied fed funds range
 
 2/1-2/82
 
 -51-
 
 memory serves me, past well
 alternatives.
 current Bluebook expansive alternative usually reflects lower
 fed funds rate projections restrictive money growth
 projections accompanied higher fed funds ranges. Now,
 last meeting, actually set targets money growth
 happened--money growth exploded--would feel
 normally would resulted lower fed funds rate
 higher one?
 seems-MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, Committee set kind
 money growth rates actually transpired past month,
 would accommodated happened without getting rise
 borrowing rise funds rate occurred.
 MR. ROOS.
 I'm trying clumsy way get this:
 possible whole concept fed funds rate

 really happens?
 money explodes, seems fed
 funds rates interest rates rise, presently.

 true? true, continue
 alternatives suggested imply lower fed funds ranges
 aggregates show higher money growth?
 MR. PARTEE. mean ought reduce funds rate

 MR. ROOS.
 sir.
 I'm suggesting relationship
 money growth fed funds ranges opposite
 Bluebook shows us.
 Bluebook usually shows lower range
 fed funds opt expansive alternative
 higher fed funds range alternative money grows
 slowly, implying bring rates up.
 that's exactly
 opposite happened, Chuck.
 MR. PARTEE.

 Yes, think-It depends supply demand.
 
 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
 
 defend Bluebook, Mr. Axilrod?
 
 MR. WALLICH. One distinguish whether movement

 increase supply money--just potatoes--increases supply

 Mr. Schultz.
 
 MR. SCHULTZ.
 don't quite understand this, gather

 argue it's price credit that's-MR. ROOS.
 
 Fred, I'm trying argue if--

 MR. ROOS.
 look happens today money grows

 It's
 exactly opposite circumstances formerly,

 MR. SCHULTZ.

 it's supply money increases, quite

 President Roos, may make comment?

 One could argue raising
