 go 2 percent, response somewhat
 proportional M1 together nontransactions component
 would roughly [as variable M1].
 President Black pointed
 out, short run clearly won't be; interest rates go up,
 market raise rates nontransactions components
 respond.
 So, short run probably ought react, [in
 effect,] moving reserve requirement demand deposits.

 is, M2 strong, really practical option lower demand
 deposits substantially; we'd use demand deposit ratio
 multiplier--for purpose [technical] adjustment [to
 nonborrowed reserve path]--rather M2 ratio.
 case
 would get powerful interest rate response.
 reduce demand
 deposits sufficiently offset expansion nontransactions
 component would require substantial rise interest rates.
 That's another way saying technical jargon

 So, try control M2 short-run period risks

 end, would
 enough [of increase interest rates] bring income

 That's
 reason started using 2 percent ratio--to moderate
 particular impact, consistent Committee's decision. Also,
 certain reality. think market response,
 control horizon M2 [necessarily] somewhat longer
 control horizon M1.
 Whether Committee would want go
 directly control funds rate make deliberate
 decision instead leaving implied reserve path-knowing control horizon M2 might little longer,
 implied M1 movements would still substantial--strikes
 issue economics it.
 personal preference,
 course, would stay reserve path think makes

 I'd like join feel interest

 therefore, come present.
 Like Governor Gramley, don't know level need come

 Therefore, would support alternative belief

 correct, Steve?

 Likewise, Lyle mentioned last time, question
