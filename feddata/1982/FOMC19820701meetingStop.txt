 It's extremely hard believe wouldn't get

 positive. Alternative A, 5-1/2 percent growth rate, would leave
 M1 September running 6 percent rate; new lower June

 September--more like 5-3/4 percent.
 So, would 1/4 point

 MR. GRAMLEY. May ask technical question, Mr. Chairman?
 one leave September levels start

 September be?
 somewhere. immediately
 MR. AXILROD.
 hand, Governor Gramley, new Q4-to-September growth rate
 would reduced 0.3 percent. level June $1

 CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. right.
 Let make one
 comment seems nature problem--I
 think corresponds many people said--with respect
 long-term ranges.
 Apart focusing numerology, may
 equally important important react whatever
 happens, particularly given uncertainty seasonal
 July. may want passive sense reacting,
 depending upon happens doesn't happen early weeks
 July. Now, much introduction wants say something?
 Mr. Black.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm happy,
 might suspect, revision June M1 figure.
 I've
 computed correctly, allow us bring M1 September
 top upper band without slam brakes.

 figure I've computed June--and I'm using
 May figure June since we're assuming zero rate growth-would allow us hit target letting money supply grow
 4.6 percent.
 think gets us dilemma suggested
 yesterday--being rock hard place--because
 that, would preserve credibility coming
 top target wouldn't say deliberately
 plan overshoot target, think would [ill advised].
 time, we'd aiming higher rate growth M1
 appear gotten last three months, don't
 think we'd risk severe tightening money market
 conditions dangers might entail.
 So, would urge
 strongly aim top part September, would
 take whatever M2 figure Steve thinks compatible that.
 I'm
 guessing borrowing level $900 million might
 right and, usual, would like widen federal funds range.
 case July wild, I'd like able go 17 percent
 hope like devil didn't [go high].

 time, I'd like reduce lower end 10 percent hope

 Since it's unlikely we'll able anything get interest

 VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
 Let ask question:

 knew Congress Administration going continue
 run huge budgetary deficits next two three years,
 would change monetary policy?
 Incidently, might say
 calculate we've mark exactly last two years
 New York budgetary deficit. calculate, Board's
 economic assumptions, deficit fiscal '83 $180
 billion. economic assumptions it's $166 billion,
 there's lot aside that--it's Bill Ford I'm talking

 back [to question]:
 assume deficit
 going $166 $180 billion fiscal '83 it's going

 would change monetary policy?
 MR. GRAMLEY. asked Economic Advisory Council
