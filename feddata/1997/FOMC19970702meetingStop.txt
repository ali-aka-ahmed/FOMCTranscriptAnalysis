 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions, would somebody like
 start meeting discussion? President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Economic activity remains strong
 Kansas City District, signs slowing. directors business contacts
 report solid economic growth throughout District. Retail sales robust
 manufacturing remains quite healthy. Two strikes mentioned last meeting
 ended satisfactorily, 4,200 workers back work. Conditions continued
 improve District's farm energy sectors. District's wheat harvest way
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 expectations largest crop since 1994. Also, cattle prices improved
 ranchers making modest profits. energy sector, drilling activity registered
 another small gain May despite decline oil gas prices. Tempering
 positive economic news District, construction activity tended level total
 employment fell slightly April even adjustment strikes.
 Retail prices holding steady Kansas City District, labor markets tight
 continue hear reports wage pressures. Many firms continue difficulty filling
 entry-level positions hiring skilled workers. quote month one
 directors Southern Oklahoma reported labor markets tight town
 everyone working wanted working want to. [Laughter]
 Several branch directors respondents survey informally reported normal
 wage increases markets, especially entry level. example, owner one
 large retail chains reported entry-level wages increased somewhere
 neighborhood 10 percent plus last year. However, rate increase spotty;
 see wages pressing rates uniformly across District.
 national front, despite moderate pace growth second quarter,
 economy appears fundamentally strong. would agree much said
 Greenbook. expect real GDP growth pick somewhat second half

 stop, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District economic growth vigorous
 thus far 1997. Payroll employment expanded 3 percent annual rate first
 four months year probably May well. rate slightly last year's
 pace. durable goods manufacturing sector performed particularly well, strong
 demand continued high-tech products materials related aircraft production.
 California's economy fully track, state currently ranking seventh
 nationally pace payroll job creation. Los Angeles sharing fully state's
 economic success. Employment growth LA County accelerated substantially year,
 county's unemployment rate declined 1-1/2 percentage points past 12
 months 6.8 percent.
 Five District states ranked among top seven nationally yearly
 rates payroll job creation. accelerating substantially last year, Washington State
 economy settled solid growth path. Although economic expansions fast growth
 intermountain states Oregon slowed slightly 1997, states remain strong
 growth paths stable declining unemployment rates. Even Hawaii shown signs
 year reversing several-year pattern employment declines.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 Sustained rapid expansion caused rising inflation many areas District.
 San Francisco Bay area, sharp acceleration prices services led rising consumer
 price inflation 1996 early 1997. Inflation strong growth areas District also
 increased 1996 likely rise year.
 Turning national economy, recent data confirmed growth economic
 activity slowed markedly, probably rate around 2 percent second quarter,
 little lower Greenbook projection. Although forecast shows growth picking
 second half year, drops back sustainable pace 1998. think
 number factors restraining prospective growth, economy's rapid expansion
 past year left operating noticeably higher level according traditional
 measures capacity rate unemployment, rates capacity utilization,
 GDP gap.
 indicators provide good reasons concerned future trend
 inflation, lags policy mean must forward-looking. regard,
 concerned indications excess demand resources. situation raises two key
 questions difficult resolve. First, estimates capacity accurate,
 second, given capacity estimates, economy's growth likely slow enough
 long enough period time eliminate inflationary pressure may exist? balancing
 uncertainties, best judgment underlying inflation show upward trend.
 GDP price index, forecast indicates increase around 2-1/4 percent year
 2-3/4 percent 1998. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, economic conditions Midwest remain quite
 similar reported May meeting. regional economy still expanding
 modest rate, District manufacturers retailers continue report competitive
 pressures inhibit ability raise prices. manufacturing sector still operating
 high levels. Chicago Purchasing Managers' Survey results, released Monday, showed
 sharp increase composite index 61.5 June 56.8 May, indicative pickup
 rate expansion manufacturing sector. Contacts report strong activity number
 industries including steel, heavy trucks, cement, gypsum board, agricultural heavy
 equipment. However, large national paper manufacturer headquartered District reported
 slow growth shipments containerboard noted reducing capacity
 temporarily closing two plants.
 terms consumer spending trends, retailers indicated sales slowdown
 evident April May continued much June. However, sales improved
 significantly latter part June warm weather finally arrived. illustrate
 adverse impact cold weather, one large national retailer headquartered District
 noted year-to-date basis, unit sales air conditioners 38 percent compared
 last year. retailer also reported sales white goods flat year-to-date;
 taking conservative approach second half year. Contacts trucking
 industry reported shipments new merchandise retailers nationwide slowed
 first quarter. probably indicates attempts retailers keep inventories line
 slower sales pace. Information auto industry suggests reports light vehicle sales
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 released week probably show June sales annual rate around 14.8 14.9
 million units, would consistent implied Greenbook forecast.
 labor markets still tight. unemployment rate District states
 4.1 percent April third straight month fell 3.8 percent May. Despite tight
 labor markets, still seen much upward pressure wages, although reports
 mixed. Contacts one large national retailer said still difficulty attracting
 workers, recent labor settlement UAW calls 50 percent reduction wages
 benefits new hires foundry, resulting two-tier wage structure. contrast,
 another retail chain increased wages 10 percent still trouble getting workers.
 large phone company seeing upward pressure wages, particularly marketing
 managerial people. trucking industry, one firm's 33 percent increase truck driver wages
 went effect February year enough attract many drivers
 needed, started advertising drivers. trucking firms raised wages
 considerably, increase industry 10 15 percent.
 Turning national outlook, since met May new data confirmed
 view growth slowed considerably second quarter first-quarter pace. Further,
 good news price front, CPI rose .1 percent May.
 However, anything, labor markets appear tighter previously anticipated,
 currently positive output gap. forecast growth near trend next
 quarters maintain gap shrink it. Consequently, see significant risk
 economy operating beyond long-term potential underlying inflationary
 pressures worsen gradually next quarters, though pressures may

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, economic activity Fifth District seems
 part following pattern recent national data. nation whole,
 consumer spending strong region latter part last year early
 part year, clearly decelerated second quarter, especially spending
 automobiles, durable goods, apparel. question, course, region
 national economy whether deceleration temporary phenomenon something
 permanent. Unfortunately, recent data anecdotal information District
 shed much light issue. Consistent comments Greenbook
 relating national economy, signs pickup retail activity

 7/1-2/97
 
 does, strong going forward. Certainly, fundamentals seem place
 support reacceleration consumer spending region months ahead.
 Labor markets remain exceptionally tight District apparently

 concluding definite way longer-run trend growth productivity
 increased, certainly possibility may looking moderate increase.
 said last meeting, either events would imply need higher real interest rates.
 inflation expectations basically stable, moderate increase nominal funds rate would
 give us moderate increase real interest rates. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. Eighth District economy continues grow
 pace consistent national trends. Firms report moderate gains sales employment,
 often hear concerns labor availability put damper expansion plans. Tight
 labor markets reflected average unemployment rate 4.6 percent District states
 April. Manpower's employment survey third quarter shows increased job opportunities
 compared three months earlier. survey 223 small businesses District revealed
 18 percent plan increase sales prices months ahead, 3 percent

 Year-to-date sales tax receipts District states running nearly 5 percent ahead
 period one year ago. Retailers District remain optimistic sales growth second
 half 1997. Although results April May mixed, many say sales growth
 generally line expectations current inventories desired levels.
 loan demand appears slowing District banks, many still experiencing doubledigit growth rates loans year-over-year basis. contacts report generous
 lending terms stemming stiff competition, consistent recent Senior
 Loan Officers Survey nation whole.
 national economy indeed turning impressive performance. far 1997
 economy created average 229,000 nonfarm payroll jobs per month, well
 projected longer-term trends labor force growth. Consumer confidence indices high
 levels, manufacturing continues show strength. retail sales slumped last
 three months, part reflects adjustments exceptionally strong gains early year.
 Greenbook notes, weekly chain store sales data indicate upturn June. consumer
 price index increased 1.4 percent annual rate first five months year,
 sharply 3.3 percent rate 1996. favorable inflation news come
 surprise relative forecasts made last year, Cathy Minehan noted.
 Committee might well think ways inflation gains could

 longer-term interest rates might fall line news CPI. is, 30-year Treasury
 bonds trading yield 6.7 6.8 percent recent sessions, actually notch

 rebound later year, forecast echoed Blue Chip consensus. expected 1997 CPI
 inflation rate 2.8 percent June 10, followed rate 2.9 percent 1998, rate
 professional forecasters see 10-year horizon. St. Louis forecast,
 incorporating good news real growth inflation first quarter 1997, assumes
 persistence underlying forces generated sustained real growth rate

 Usually try look statistics past couple years forecasts
 next couple years effort discern basic trends productivity, labor force growth,
 labor force participation, kinds things. want focus much longer-term

 MR. MEYER. tough act follow. read recent data consistent

 7/1-2/97
 
 surprisingly robust first-quarter growth. importantly, fundamentals supporting
 aggregate demand, judgment, remain positive: solid momentum income
 employment; financial conditions generally favorable, measures consumer
 confidence soared new highs. absence change policy, fundamentals
 appear support Greenbook projection rebound well-above-trend growth
 second half continued growth near trend 1998. result, unemployment rate
 likely trend lower coming quarters already low level. would normally
 suggest increased risk higher inflation, staff trimmed inflation forecast
 Greenbook. highlights come appreciate unusual period
 perspective relationship inflation unemployment. staff forecast
 represents careful attempt balance inflation risk stemming prevailing projected
 labor utilization rates continuing exceptional performance inflation. first reading
 Greenbook, however, staff somehow mistakenly combined output path

 True, remains upward drift inflation staff forecast,
 acceleration 1998 reflects small rise oil prices following sharp decline year
 rebound non-oil import prices fall first half year.
 Compensation per hour, hand, edges .1 next year despite unemployment

 Let focus two positive elements inflation forecast support
 Greenbook story two concerns nevertheless make worried prices may rise
 Greenbook projects. first positive factor influence excellent
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 inflation performance year wage determination inflation next year. Overall,
 inflation year benefiting falling energy prices, smaller increases food prices,
 date still declining import prices. Next year, wage change core inflation feel

 still leaves unanswered question holding wages core
 inflation year despite low unemployment rate. never-ending effort reconcile
 low inflation low unemployment, placing increased weight contrast
 apparent tightness labor market seeming absence comparable
 tightness product market. illustrated fact prevailing 4.8
 percent unemployment rate estimates NAIRU, prevailing capacity
 utilization rate shade estimated natural rate. Looking historical record
 unemployment capacity utilization rates previous cycles, one reaches conclusion
 disparity unique feature current episode.
 One way appreciating significance disparity view unemployment
 rate price/price specification Phillips curve proxy overall excess demand
 across labor product markets. Given excess demand labor market
 traditionally mirrored similar degree excess demand product market,
 unemployment rate generally reasonably good proxy economy-wide excess demand.
 current case, however, unemployment rate best capturing tightness labor
 market hence overstating economy-wide excess demand. Another way seeing
 compare inflation forecasts Phillips curve using unemployment rate
 specifications using capacity utilization rates. disparity likely reflects one key
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 perhaps under-appreciated features current expansion--the robust pace business
 fixed investment, notably equipment purchases particularly purchases high-technology
 equipment. result industrial capacity increasing fastest rate 28 years.
 net effect labor markets tight, increasing productive capacity associated

 much reported absence pricing leverage firms emphasize may another implication
 absence excess demand product markets. Nothing gives firm market power like
 excess demand. also suspect firms responded absence pricing leverage
 less willing bid aggressively workers, thereby helping explain wage change

 considerations encourage expect continued modest inflation forecast horizon.
 Let conclude, however, two reasons remain concerned inflation
 may nevertheless increase projected staff forecast. First, unemployment rate
 averaged 5.4 percent 1996, close current estimates NAIRU. fallen
 significantly threshold couple months. rise wage change
 would normally anticipate prevailing unemployment gap may therefore ahead.
 emphasized above, role capacity utilization rate view damp rather

 7/1-2/97
 
 contributing restraint increases compensation consumer prices.
 factors likely diminishing importance going forward.
 balance, absence policy changes expect above-trend growth
 coming quarters, decline unemployment rate, still modest inflation. Perhaps
 main message would remarkably benign outcome. get
 paid worry get paid hold line inflation. concerned increase
 inflation may somewhat sharper projected Greenbook, believe single
 important risk factor forecast potential significantly sharper rise
 inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. lot suspicions discussed
 last time seem bit confirmed. slowdown consumption,
 least March May. Inflation appears remained well behaved. seems
 questions us cluster two areas. first whether really
 experiencing slowdown expansion. so, much? soft landing
 touchdown followed takeoff next months? second area questions
 clusters around inflation. possible inflation record favorable?
 much longer reap benefits benign inflationary environment?
 structured comments around two sets questions.
 First, respect factors contributing length perhaps
 upcoming strengthening expansion, certainly behavior labor market,
 already discussed around table today. People appear coming
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 woodwork join labor force. consistent widespread reports labor shortages,
 hiring bonuses, retention bonuses impressive. intermeeting period, made
 several trips Midwest West, met several groups Board.
 particularly impressed labor shortage stories. never thought would
 hearing in-migration suggested accepted answer Iowa's economic challenges.
 [Laughter] Business people talking recognizing
 locate transport new workers, also train unskilled workers meet
 production needs. Clearly, indicates labor market going strong while.
 sure quite buy Greenbook forecast 4.6 percent unemployment rate
 1998, even rate drifts bit, clear U.S. job machine alive
 well. Strong labor markets mean people wherewithal spend, certainly
 seeing evidence aggregate numbers retail sales housing.
 second area contributing strength expansion business
 fixed investment. think fundamentals remain growth area. overall cost
 capital low short-term long-term debt financing internal external
 equity financing. capital shortage certainly credit crunch. Profit levels
 holding up, puts management mood expand least buy
 equipment improve productivity. low inflation environment, believe, especially
 conducive capital investment. fact, declining prices computers information
 technology make investments particularly viable presence tight labor markets.
 gains productivity capital seem encouraging additional investment.
 technology story well documented, think firms learning manage inventories
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 closely. two factors seem feed other: business investment creates job
 opportunities, strong labor market allows continued growth consumption
 aggregate demand. guess located least getting close zone
 sustainability.
 second set questions identified relates inflation.
 favorable inflationary performance recently? performance probably
 attributed number factors. strong dollar accompanied low-inflation imports
 helped control domestic inflation. Increased business fixed investment added capacity
 improved productivity. macroeconomic weakness economies
 foreign trade partners alleviated commodity price pressures. recent
 energy food shocks, farm outlook 1997 quite favorable also. Now, lest get
 cocky, remember BLS made improvements CPI
 measurement, shaving several tenths index. President Moskow drew attention
 this. quite rosy outlook, see considerable risks: economy could turn
 stronger anticipate. Consumers could reemerge go spending spree.
 international sector strengthens, expect less drag GDP growth,
 concomitantly may bring back inflationary pressures. respect inflation,
 point wage pressures start bite. Productivity improvements absorb
 much. believe key area us watch profit margins. see significant profit
 declines, investment activity would slow could trigger sizable stock market correction.
 possibility development certainly highlighted Greenbook.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 sum, seen bit slowdown expansion, may already
 come gone may way out. seem bit soon tell, risk
 growth may anticipated.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, economic growth Second
 District slowed slightly past six weeks, growth taking place mainly
 New York City. Economic activity rather stagnant rest New York State,
 growth slowed slightly northern part New Jersey.
 great differences forecasts members let

 happening today. puts us forecasting business. us believe price stability,

 years forecasting models working well, witness bad forecasts

 length last meeting, underestimating continue
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 underestimate productivity, aren't sure that. fact, meeting meeting
 exception March, Committee fretting waiting. think many us
 felt risk waiting quite low because, measured real fed funds rate
 ways, policy fact rather tight; certainly loose. Therefore, believe
 afford continue wait greater certainty really
 happening economy. members Committee concerned
 credibility wait, certainly concerned wait long. think

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. count, cleanup hitter
 excellent tour de table. Nearly every thing said, brief.
 seem finally getting slowdown expansion, albeit quarter later expected.
 inflation news continues good, none indices surging, beginning
 show signs drifting upward, still either flat drifting 12-month change
 basis. continue try best scan carefully emerging pressures inflationary
 pipeline. I've seen little pressure number quarters, recently
 straws wind new pressures may starting emerge expected
 increase level import prices forth. glaring exception, course,
 remarkable labor market; everybody talked that. far, price levels
 little affected low unemployment rate rising ECI, unit labor costs
 production remained stable. However, Greenbook projecting substantial
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 sustained acceleration unit labor costs beginning almost immediately, time tell
 that. condition economy today remains excellent, tensions pressures
 continue build one looks forward forecast horizon. rate expansion
 remains moderate, remarkable era could continue well future. However, growth
 reaccelerate strongly short run, Committee may need reassess conditions
 quickly critically. Looking forecast period, would like
 confident Greenbook's projection substantially slower growth 1998.
 seems quite likely growth exceed Greenbook projection forecast
 period, especially additional monetary restraint middle next
 year. now, however, steady goes. going well far. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. pointed out, come end

 likely quite interesting. call Dave Stockton lead us set issues.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Parry.
 MR. PARRY. don't questions either, comments. I, too, think
 good study, clearly based first-rate empirical work. like use
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 model-based simulations illustrate tradeoffs facing policy. least me,
 simulations suggest flexible approach pursuing price stability would generate
 excessive variability output. importantly, believe study contains
 useful insights well. one thing, gives us working definition price stability.
 Measured terms broad indices least, value around 1 percent seems reasonable.
 Since inflation measured broad indices still rising rate 2 2-1/2 percent,
 clearly price stability, this, course, fact brought Bluebook
 well. Moreover, study shows seem matter index choose.
 Focusing one broad price index rather another unlikely make significant
 difference longer-term success policies, think focus longer term
 appropriate. Finally perhaps importantly, would like Committee focus
 clearly pursuit price stability, require address
 issues raised study also list issues Dave Stockton's cover memo.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would like raise fundamental question
 whole issue. something need address shorter term, come
 look beyond 5-, 8-, 10-year horizon. start focus price stability now,
 try aware problems may confronting longer term.
 First, let raise heretical issue. price stability really
 financial stability? Even generally, going back time tended argue,
 think correctly, objective monetary policy create maximum sustainable economic
 growth, argued, think quite correctly, price stability necessary
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 condition reach goal. price stability may indeed proxy something else,
 suspect financial stability.
 look data working, part problem
 discussed around table relates fact increasing proportion nominal
 GDP involves items whose prices, define estimate them, undergoing
 significant declines ranging 15, 20, even 30 percent per year. argue tomorrow
 industries accounting 3 percent nominal GDP created third increase
 real GDP past year. require much analytical insight see
 segments economy increasing nominal share GDP continue
 so, point looking average price level falling could
 falling quite significantly. would argue deflation meaningful sense
 word. Indeed, question really whether something wish fight. reason
 define price stability terms whatever price measure using run
 increasing proportion high-tech products falling prices, would led
 price stability objective inflate economy prices falling. clearly cannot
 make sense.
 One difficulties created involves tough conceptual
 measurement problems us. means clear exactly measure price
 stability, given prospect become increasingly difficult time define
 constitutes output prices. raised issue earlier meeting suggested really
 didn't matter much policy standpoint may well
 endeavoring stabilize inflation premium long-term interest rates. short,
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 Jerry Jordan said, question whether looking inflation prices decline
 purchasing power money. context, even get point
 able define explicitly unit production bundle goods services involved

 question still nominal interest rate there. inflation
 premium necessity implicit nominal interest rate. may able define
 particular price, end know markets operating basis notion

 purchasing power money, however measured.
 reason raise questions worry much
 current period, noted. wish put table notion that, respond
 excellent paper Dave Stockton colleagues, bear mind paper really
 refers nearer term. problems dealing get beyond turn
 century going increasingly difficult resolve fact define.
 conceptual problem involved defining nominal GDP, principle calculate
 last dollar even last cent know measure correctly.
 unambiguously defined. unit production not; price not. So, think problems
 deal defining stabilizing going increase years
 ahead. want suggest confront question whether trying
 stabilize prices trying stabilize financial system. issue asset prices
 comes in; certain sense positioned continuum begins spot prices units
 goods services.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 sum, speculating going problems quite different
 today. saying involve issues need
 resolve today, suspect start confront 5 years certainly within 10 years,
 may well affect projections going to, say, year 2006. also suspect
 around year 2006, tricky question may involve endeavoring
 stabilize may focus policy actions. guess going
 dealing asset prices, question nominal long-term interest rates, probably
 outlook nominal GDP well. event, task surely tougher today,
 issue proceed. moment, fortunately, issue.
 probably violating President McTeer's view sit enjoy it,
 want mention different set worries. Tomorrow, raise
 conventional worries.
 MR. MEYER. theoretical framework, think understand
 one thing measure define price stability; may something else define
 inflation target. want put table view that, decide want target
 price stability might call price stability plus small cushion, still need
 lot research dealing nominal rigidities, potential flexibility real interest rates,
 whether little deflation dangerous little inflation. want throw out.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. couple comments. First,
 agree good paper right time talking issue. issue
 put context, mentioned, important goal sustainable growth.
 put context, becomes important discussion item.
 perspective, brought table realization that, regardless price
 measure may mind, price stability. something keep
 front us, continue talk about, introduce public point broaden
 education issue. mind, think take paper discussion
 next step, namely might mean policy standpoint might proceed.
 regard point looking ahead, ten years whatever,
 anticipate happening economy, agree conditions
 substantially different. However, convinced prospective changes period
 substantially pronounced gone past 10 15
 years. deal changes ahead part discussion measure prices
 define price stability. constantly refining thinking that, think
 continue going forward. regard, analysis
 working definition price stability helpful assist us discussions
 work toward making progress achieving price stability objective.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let raise related question table
 largely because, knowledge, nobody around table supports alternative question.
 looking page 2 memorandum. page follows executive summary
 comprised several pages. second sentence page 2 heading "Theoretical
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 Issues Related Choice Appropriate Price Index" says part "the case price
 stability rests belief inflation costly." general agreement around table
 inflation costly undesirable, universal view. view really
 addressed paper. extent want go forward pursuit price stability,
 need recognize absence universal belief benefits price stability.
 regard, find major change central bank politics. really quite
 remarkable central banks seized upon issue crucial. Indeed, look
 communiques G-7 summits, take desirability price stability given. Yet,
 papers like Akerlof-Dickens-Perry article similar paper Canada
 raising questions basic policy objective. notion widespread support price
 stability given assert really quite there. looked
 word "belief' sentence quoted from, struck writing it,
 would said "because case price stability rests something belief."
 [Laughter] rests greater higher conviction. hesitate interesting
 question.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. true believer, nothing
 stronger belief!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. may well be, true believer often great
 difficulty communicating reasons belief third party.
 MR. MEYER. follow examples: Marty Feldstein
 paper tries demonstrate importance squeezing last bit inflation
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 achieve low inflation, defines 2 percent. countries zone inflation
 targeting ranges 1 3 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Part bias question.
 MR. MEYER. is, call bias plus cushion. think issue
 really confront. need little work whether
 costs outweigh benefits eliminating last, say, percentage point inflation.
 regard, keep mind look literature costs inflation,
 find enormous nonlinearity costs. high high inflation rates.
 discernible modest inflation rates, fact 8 10 percent
 inflation really hard find definitive evidence. So, think long way go
 research make case definitively, particularly last percentage point.
 think want little cautious.
 MR. PARRY. feeling Dave Stockton would want study
 again! [Laughter]
 MR. PRELL. emphasis "again." [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. add brief observation recent point
 made, would agree importance zero inflation article faith among central
 bankers still lot work ahead us make case society whole.
 main point.
 I, too, thought paper quite helpful. One main conclusions
 broad measures inflation examined tend move together long run
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 necessarily short run. Therein lies dilemma policymakers. need
 keep focus longer term make monetary policy, still make short run
 justifications carry short-run weight. Even ended
 picking "best" measure inflation, would periods would lead us astray
 measure measures would accurate. Therefore, think least one avenue
 pursue go study potential advantage basket
 price measures would enable us monitor multiple price indices rather hanging
 everything one. Committee faced similar problem period leading
 Humphrey-Hawkins supposed target money. question
 money? M0, Ml, M2, M3, think one time M8. point, one
 goes far. main point whatever may strengths advantages individual
 measures time, given period single measure lead us astray. little
 untidy look basket measures, think would helpful go forward consider
 basket least one alternative way might proceed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, also thought paper well done.
 good step forward addressing issue, type longer-term issue
 important Committee review time time. intrigued Ed Boehne's
 suggestion considering basket measures least one option. coming
 slightly different way. going choose one measure, slight preference
 continuing focus consumer price index. basket measures,
 would say CPI basket.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. BOEHNE. first among equals.
 MR. MOSKOW. preference CPI stems much technical
 superiority measure familiarity public. inflation measures,
 received attention. switch focus CPI one single
 measure, think would risk causing lot confusion divert energy away
 productive efforts educate public importance price stability. others
 noted, doesn't matter much, according memo, broad index choose
 choose one. reason stabilize one inflation rate, tend stabilize
 all. matter index chosen, simulations suggest economic performance
 would enhanced. So, important thing choose index basket indices
 stick goals first capping inflation moving inflation rates
 achieve price stability, however define latter.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. I, too, thought excellent stimulating paper. don't think
 we've dissenting vote score. think lot put
 marginal research effort. guess paper convinced would put refining

 go back Susan Phillips' point, feeling part criticism

 offered supporting evidence well. view, credibility would
 enhanced, undermined, serious discussion. Humphrey-Hawkins may right
 venue it, inform public real issues really
 thinking them, credibility think have.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suspect last couple years going give
 us data observation points helpful case. demonstrate
 effectively lower rate inflation, higher rate productivity growth.
 demonstrate that, make case low inflation; cannot, tough case
 make, especially inflation falls Larry Meyer's 8 10 percent range.
 MS. RIVLIN. causality question here. also look whether
 low unemployment gives high productivity growth tradeoff is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. cannot demonstrate least covariation,
 causation issue never comes up. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Rather comment paper directly, would like comment
 point moment ago sentence word "belief" it--the belief
 inflation costly. statement belief may universally held within
 community central bankers, want go central banker heaven, necessarily
 outside small group. express view believe minority view around
 table. lot people said price stability regarded end
 means end, latter maximum sustainable growth. price
 stability means end, think worthy end itself, lose lot
 emphasizing that. little easier think distinction borrow
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 believe Jerry Jordan's view distinction price stability stability value

 responsibility take care dollar. People using dollars store value,
 think something moral obligation protect value dollar regardless
 statistical studies whether 1 percent 2 percent 3 percent inflation might maximize real

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think try make point periodically.
 MR. MCTEER. believe may overdo point price stability means

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. person may well spent less career time puzzling

 come simple conclusion differences among primary indices

 7/1-2/97

 Unfortunately, current state public understanding concept, even pushing
 inflation somewhat current level, minimally advanced cannot imagine us
 position use justification near-term policy actions without engaging
 great deal educational effort. Again, know come debate later many
 people, think underestimate need talk this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. little careful misreading
 one respect. polls show inflation rate low one worried
 inflation. Trying convince inflation problem perceive
 one, basically already low, difficult.
 MR. GUYNN. That's trying say.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. best time try argue move 2-1/2 2

 MS. MINEHAN. must say I, too, enjoyed reading paper. came

 One things impressed stable things 4-

 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. basic determinant tells us

 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. enough data points recent history

 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, one part fascinating discussion leaves

 prices necessarily relevant way measure whatever want measure
 tomorrow's world. important questions, must lose sight fact
 manage policy related question manage policy low
 inflation era. era. may price level stability, however someone
 may want define it, low inflation period. price indices look
 show inflation rising 1 2 percent trend flat. indices 2
 3 percent area, don't think 3 percent point. Much discussion
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 price level stability focused inflation rates 1 3 percent area.
 manage policy framework, rather imminent questions.
 Larry Meyer raises probably basic question, is, socially
 optimal era? range, range? policy respond differently
 inflation low absolute level high? one percentage point
 difference inflation level may mean something entirely different absolute level
 5 6 percent opposed 1 2 percent. policy respond differently,
 respond? going get lower levels inflation, going
 start pockets deflation. think those,
 extent acceptable condition? sum, low inflation problems
 know. face them, think could well get
 situation may need face them. So, practical problems
 need work even thinking longer-term, perhaps little
 theoretical, kinds concerns. guess plea is, let's give large amount attention
 nearer-term problems dealing others.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Let make several brief observations: terms general
 question overall value low inflation, seems actually developed
 evidence. think performance U.S. economy 1960s, much
 1980s, much decade, periods favorable economic
 performance periods relatively low inflation. prove causality, step
 away rigor economists might want apply think general public, seems
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 process developing practical evidence. get
 think tougher question--and agree Larry Meyer Cathy Minehan this-of demonstrating significant payoff reducing inflation from, say, 3
 2-1/2 percent. think significant challenge. don't think evidence
 would convince skeptics sensible sound thing do.
 Finally, raise question, wonder whether preferable
 basket inflation measures opposed one measure. paper suggests long
 pick broad index, danger going significantly course extended
 period time. seems working monetary aggregates,
 really something little different. trying various combinations
 permutations bank liabilities, knowingly changing concept. think
 know general concept make lot difference empirically specific
 measure choose.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, seems
 talking about, directly indirectly, whether publicly stated, publicly agreed
 upon goal monetary policy. mean goal little clear citizens
 country would describe goal sustained economic growth achieved
 price stability, turn defined number. fact, use working
 definition. view, would benefit clearly stated goal price
 stability today would give us better signals. could stop debate would
 accountable American people would better idea
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 supposed whether it. democracy, one extremely
 pragmatic. Given absence absolute certainty supposed doing,
 fact successful bringing level inflation. Despite done
 that, however, political criticism central bank increasing.
 particularly rewarded achievement; instead, increasing questioning.
 Going back Humphrey-Hawkins report testimony, think
 clear think ought goal monetary policy go start
 selling it. quite know sell agreed it,
 certain attempt sell make likely able carry
 policy effectively rather less.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus, going close us
 down.
 MR. BROADDUS. comments wanted make paper
 already made, many cases once, make quick comment
 broader issue desirability price level stability, come interesting
 discussion.
 
 couple points. One is, Gary Stern mentioned, lot work
 
 already done support idea price stability desirable longer-term objective
 central bank. thought lot good evidence support view summarized
 Kansas City conference Jackson Hole last year.
 second point little vague. Let put way: think
 underestimate degree appreciation already exists among public concerning
 desirability benefits something approaching price level stability. see everyday life
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 hear conversations growing realization least part explanation
 universally recognized good macro economic performance something way
 conducting monetary policy focus low inflation eventual price stability. Like
 stew, one let appreciation steep, slowly surely grow. need
 do, seems me, reinforce every way can. One dimension price stability
 current inflation numbers, important expectational component.
 need reinforce view going maintain progress made,
 think pay time. think need strategy, needs clear
 be. view, paper good first step helping us build strategy
 address related tactics go forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Unless anyone final words, think Al Broaddus
 completed session good note. Congratulations staff took
 impossible subject made slightly less so.
 [Meeting recessed]

 July 2, 1997--Morning Session
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. turn discussion long-run ranges
 monetary aggregates, call Tom Simpson.
 MR. SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. referring handout called
 "Material Staff Presentation Money Debt Ranges." [Statement related handout-see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, going back bottom panel Exhibit 3,
 would assume substitute gross domestic income gross domestic product,
 recent data would look good would getting higher V2.
 MR. SIMPSON. Right, points would farther apart.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. actually done calculations see
 would look like? words, part tightness fit see function
 widening statistical discrepancy national accounts de minimis?
 MR. PRELL. think talking .02 scale. don't think
 would greatly alter recent picture.
 MR. KOHN. Especially revision went back couple years.
 MR. PRELL. It's question starting points thinking this.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. gap opening since 1994, V2
 shifts progressively time observations here. recent
 observations top fitted line, would expect little drift.
 MR. SIMPSON. could alter slope.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't know significant is, raise
 questions. Since observations, clear happening.
 President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Also reference Exhibit 3, seems developments
 last couple years clearly encouraging. focus bottom panel exhibit,
 also seems clear velocity continuing change. particular, one run
 regression include forecast period, would produced different velocity. So,
 exhibit seems encouraging me, also illustrates would mistake assume
 velocity stable.
 MR. SIMPSON. Right. mentioned Bluebook, thought M2
 velocity boosted somewhat year continuing large inflows mutual funds,
 presumably involving diversions M2 accounts.
 MR. KOHN. also case fit things econometrically, find
 small time trends period covered bottom line covered top.
 Thus, charts show bigger misses relative fitted line models
 models time trend them. think basic point still correct.
 sense, amazing little velocity shifted given huge flows stock
 mutual funds.
 MR. SIMPSON. look upper panel, alternative interpretation would
 big upward movement early part 1990s slowed rather come
 end.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? President Jordan.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. JORDAN. couple things: regard question, Mr. Chairman,
 looked gross domestic purchases instead nominal GDP also
 command basis GDP. That's trying relate money held household
 income command U.S. citizens resources. change picture little.
 statistical relationship MZM better terms stability functional relationship.
 series volatile higher interest elasticity, still get tighter fit
 MZM, especially use gross domestic purchases command basis.
 question, real question, complete picture NAIRU
 alternative. Bluebook presents almost "for information" kind alternative
 assumes NAIRU 4.8 percent, really doesn't anything it. would
 helpful, anyway, Exhibit 4 completed include would implied
 velocities three aggregates assumption appropriate ranges
 aggregates. might choose change nominal funds rate, opportunity costs would
 change, lower NAIRU implication choice appropriate
 ranges.
 MR. SIMPSON. mentioned, supply shock sort particularly
 Committee wanted see shock show terms real output, would
 get nominal GDP money growth.
 MR. KOHN. low NAIRU alternative, would small effects
 nominal GDP lower inflation. clear way nominal GDP would go since
 would higher output lower inflation. Actually, think nominal GDP would bit
 lower scenario baseline scenario. Interest rates would rising,
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 would help boost M2, nominal GDP would little lower inflation would
 much lower. So, don't know way would go, guess net effect would
 alter projection M2 great deal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Tom? Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Tom, could expand bit Exhibit 1, shows growth
 federal debt turning up?
 MR. SIMPSON. basically keeping slightly larger deficit
 projecting 1998.
 MS. PHILLIPS. take current budget negotiations account?
 MR. SIMPSON. assumed fiscal package.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Okay.
 MR. PRELL. recall unified deficit forecast next fiscal year
 somewhat larger deficit fiscal year. calendar-year basis,
 timing borrowing means payment cash flows federal government,
 step-up borrowing one would expected basis unified
 deficits two fiscal years.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Tom? strikes M2
 creeping way back potential use. creates interesting questions including need
 review issues raised yesterday reserve requirements contemporaneous
 reserves. issues, including longer-term target ranges, package.
 extent M2 appreciable monetary policy significance, then, course,
 ranges irrelevant except sense technical meaning reserve
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 balances similar measures. Frankly, less areas, better
 probably are. anything required sweeps, example,
 unavoidable technical problems elevates issue money supply level
 conform way currently employ monetary aggregates.
 impression current ranges aggregates point
 probably change capture center expected outcomes.
 would inclined simply reproduce wrote 6 months 12 months ago reasons
 changing ranges save lot typeface. true cost
 cutter Federal Reserve! [Laughter] rather fascinating recall good forecasts
 growth aggregates been. retrospect, M2 forecast year ago
 right money. M2 growth continues way, make decision,
 significant decision, M2 range. irony good forecast
 exactly year ago. preference, frankly, would retain
 ranges have.
 MR. JORDAN. agree extent decide change way
 use ranges monetary aggregates. anticipation possibility one,
 two, three Humphrey-Hawkins hearings road may want give little
 different weight information M2 providing, think would useful start preparing
 Congress public change. would alert change would
 return 1970s kind monetary targeting rather intended use aggregates
 contemporaneous monitor policy actions interacting real economy.
 believe would mistake allow people outside think go back
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 setting target ranges forward-looking sense could provide information trigger
 increases decreases federal funds rate. Rather, range used monitoring
 especially if, staff paper says, feedback effects interactions--the simultaneous
 determination aspect nominal income money--are getting weight, want
 characterize range monitor going economy. telling us
 something demand central bank money target trying hit.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. actually started fringes
 Congressional testimony. relationships hold, think gradually increase
 emphasis aggregates. event, Committee going reach crucial point
 decide whether start something formal. going
 interesting discussion, part think us slightly different time
 frames mind. must admit happen agree view get sense
 going lock aggregates, soon find backing off,
 chagrin. remains later discussion. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, agree suggestion support alternative I.
 seems M2 velocity coming closer stabilizing, don't think enough
 evidence yet put weight aggregates time.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, also agree suggestion would prefer
 stay alternative I. want comment, though, point Jerry Jordan made. read
 Bluebook time, found facing choice. concluded wanted use
 aggregates indicators projections, would choose one alternative. decided
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 use targets assumed velocity, would choose another. get point
 starting put weight aggregates, think need careful discussion
 want use them. Otherwise, going split votes tend
 issues interpretation alternative versus alternative II.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. old P-star memo sitting bottom
 desk might help. could blow dust pull out! President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. I, too, agree change ranges reasons
 people given today mentioned last couple times talked this.
 know exactly using measures money formulation
 implementation monetary policy, think well advised keep ranges way
 are. would also encourage discussion road exactly use
 measures trends continue.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. delighted see M2 better. thought
 detailed memo received helpful moved ball little farther
 field. agree proposal, Mr. Chairman; think change ranges
 time. would align Jerry Jordan's comments think would
 useful start talk way see M2 changing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, certainly agree recommendation.
 say impressed increasing evidence M2 may coming back
 track. produced supporting research Bank supplement excellent staff
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 paper done here. basis analysis seen, think case
 made, Bluebook indicates this, setting provisional range 1998
 assumption M2 continue reassert old pattern. would want
 quite yet. One attractive things 1 5 percent range M2,
 around while, sense closest thing nominal anchor
 absence inflation target similar target. would reluctant give up. said
 that, think continue see evidence remainder 1997 M2 coming
 back strongly track, probably ought consider changing 1998 range take
 another look February. That's because, normal behavior, M2 could actually
 come near top end 1 5 percent range, might feel little uncomfortable
 maintaining range move 1998.
 would like make couple additional comments focus longer-term
 strategy. Humphrey-Hawkins meetings recent years, used agenda item
 opportunity make pitch inflation targets, sometimes recommended, Mr.
 Chairman, might little precise testimony objective
 holding line inflation. want say still think worthy ideas,
 hope get weight attention. know feel issue,
 repeat arguments today.
 would like, though, make brief comment closely related matter, one
 think increasingly serious issue standpoint strategy conduct
 longer-run monetary policy. points related things Jerry Jordan said
 yesterday. is, absence clear firm nominal anchor policy, almost
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 public's attention monetary policy focuses federal funds rate prospect
 may change particular point time. Obviously, nothing new, seems
 single-mindedness intensity public focus is, anything, little stronger
 may historically. view, presents potentially serious risks
 conduct policy going forward.
 particular, seems widespread tendency view almost tactical
 increase federal funds rate effort part reduce inflation restraining
 economic growth, even objective really hold line inflation. result,
 almost funds rate increase days going turn lightning rod. situation,
 think important make every effort better job explaining public
 expect funds rate target, matter short-term interest rates,
 behave current regime why. Specifically, think need make point
 current environment, actual inflation low anti-inflationary credibility
 relatively high, though maybe perfect, short-term nominal interest rates essentially
 short-term real interest rates, short-term real rates routinely move
 order clear credit markets.
 Dave Stockton made point like Chart Show comments yesterday.
 Whenever future income prospects brighten relative current prospects perceived permanent
 income rises, however want describe it, households business firms going
 want borrow anticipated future income, demand credit rise.
 situation, short-term real rates need rise maintain balance supply demand
 credit markets, Fed needs let happen. point is--and really main
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 point want make--that actions like part restrictive monetary policy actions
 usually portrayed press elsewhere. neutralizing actions.
 situations, really tightening policy; simply minimum needed hold
 line inflation maintain current inflation rate. Far endangering expansion,
 seems kinds actions essential sustaining it. really pose
 kinds risk economy actions necessarily mid-1980s
 indeed tightening policy effort reduce inflation time credibility
 relatively low.
 realize points may make good economic sense may

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, agree recommendation. understand
 it, would describe money ranges last time, namely benchmarks
 would normally expect conditions reasonable price stability historic velocity

 regard discussion Al Broaddus, us
 talking issue meeting. think sense discussion agree
 completely exactly phrased need communicate basis monetary
 policy actions, namely saying objective encourage continued recovery, sustained
 economic growth, increases employment. realize difficult

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. tell you, Mike, one thing considered

 doing. allow happen, deserve beat upon persuaded
 moral high ground. long-term focus rather short-term

 7/1-2/97
 
 expediency issues--is effectively side, advocates make sound
 though moral high ground. think allowing happen unfortunate.
 merely says good are, make case, would able
 well they.
 MR. MOSKOW. agree everything said. believe need
 spend time thinking best communicate message.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. absolutely agree focus outside
 commentary monetary policy recent months good been.
 Considering going world, really unbelievable. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree adopt
 alternative I. think far early conclude recent fit V2, therefore use
 M2, anything like sure thing. One things believe aware
 effect change market focus monetary measure. may monetary aggregate
 tracks reasonably well using policy tool. Therefore, matter
 passing interest essentially indifference marketplace. hand, start
 using tool, markets going concentrate lot more, may pick
 degree volatility related used policy tool.
 broader issue explaining doing, seems
 concentration economic growth creation jobs high ground located
 appropriately dedicated to. use price stability means
 end, end itself. also like clarity involved talking interest rate
 people real world understand interest rates. understand reserve levels
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 arcane stuff like discuss. use latter appears
 effort obfuscate. understandable say believe long-term
 economic growth, believe monetary policy effective tool bring about,
 tool overnight interest rate. decide shift
 overnight interest rate means working toward long-term goal, people may like it,
 least understand it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, granted far come. think
 way could go back non-interest-rate regime--let's assume involved net borrowed
 reserve number--would believed analytically approach become
 efficient means implement policy. could identify net borrowed reserves target,
 instead associating huge range used set federal funds rate,
 could indicate expected consistent federal funds rate within relatively
 narrow range. So, would still fact focus federal funds rate. believe
 literal fixing federal funds rate inappropriate policy--a conclusion may
 well reach point theoretically it's hard make case fixing rate
 optimal way conduct monetary policy--how would reword directive would
 importance, would would view superior mechanism carry
 policy. could explain expected approach policy engender federal
 funds rate between, say, 5-1/4 5-1/2 percent narrow range like that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. would comfortable that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think could defend it. Governor Meyer.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tom Simpson's presentation
 Bluebook alternatives Humphrey-Hawkins ranges identified two distinct decisions
 make today, also third decision might want talk
 contemplate. first interpretation ranges; second boundary
 ranges; third whether want upgrade role monetary aggregates

 stay them.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. return issue whether
 inflation jobs, mistaken, Jerry, quoted James Glassman newspaper
 column yesterday day before?
 MR. JORDAN. hope not.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. thought quoted. talking
 issue job creation, example came somebody Chinese city
 everyone working shovels build dam. quoting you?
 MR. JORDAN. may come speech gave.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't set straight us. actually
 refers issue whether jobs growth ought focused on.
 MR. JORDAN. speech said Western businessman traveling
 China visited site hundreds workers building earthen dam shovels.
 businessman suggested could get earth-moving piece equipment build
 dam afternoon. Chinese official asked could done unemployment
 would create. businessman replied understood. thought
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 building dam, Chinese authorities really trying create work people. So,
 suggestion make, namely take away shovels give spoons. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't think ought repeat suggestion
 many places! fact effective argument creating jobs directly rather
 fostering economic growth create jobs. stages short-circuited
 process; involve controlling inflation order promote growth jobs.
 President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Alternative going say. communications issue,
 think also careful terms communicate. use shorthand
 internally, public confused impression affect inflation
 affect growth. So, need talk inflation context prevents use real

 that, involves certain subtlety. certainly want put position
 public think directly deliver growth real factors that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. say "ditto" arguments alternative I--keeping
 long-run ranges same. issue role M2, think spend fair amount
 time talking among ourselves. easy discussion. first issue
 whether M2 intermediate target indicator, various levels within

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. I, too, Mr. Chairman, would prefer stay current ranges.
 think important consideration moment signal effect, view
 raising ranges would risk sending wrong signal. notes yesterday's

 go-around, let relate point personal observation difficult
 found yesterday make argument low inflation. comment far

 McDonough made morning better ways communicate clearly indicate
 right direction. supportive collectively trying make case better way

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. I, too, would support alternative I. ways improve
 aspect policy process, look forward discussing future meetings.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. I, too, would go along alternative I, think
 kick difficult decision road. next months may actually easier

 period explain change thinking later one might imagine may
 something really unpopular time economy well
 blamed it. One think lot worse moments explaining things

 second point easy say raising interest rates,
 that, sustain growth economy jobs. explanation

 people ask talking totally tuning unless get explanation across.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. Alternative I. early flight, say more.
 [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. already used time really
 intended. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. concur, Mr. Chairman, alternative I. don't think add
 anything many valuable comments made around table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. fairly thorough discussion.
 get vote, minor question adjective directive, word "monitoring."
 Kohn, would explain issue?
 MR. KOHN. struck us recent Humphrey-Hawkins write-ups putting
 word "monitoring" front debt makes sound aggregate quality
 differs Committee's use monetary aggregates. think existing practice
 evolved monetary aggregates really indicators targets, somewhere
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 nexus, debt never intended target trial indicator.
 Committee decided call "monitoring" range people would expect action
 Committee actual behavior debt fell outside range. However, struck us
 one expect action one monetary aggregates breaching range,
 fact ranges monetary growth even set mind. So,
 differentiation awkward. question Committee whether drop word
 "monitoring" front word "debt" since effect ranges "monitoring" ranges.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Unless someone expresses objection, presume
 would appropriate. fascinating see anyone notices deletion. [Laughter]
 Would read version reflecting alternative I?
 MR. BERNARD. wording paragraph long-run ranges page 29

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Mr. Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. begin thoughts
 longer-term strategy section Bluebook, referring charts
 document. talk bit results exercises might might relate
 current situation finish comments proposed changes wording
 operational paragraph shown Bluebook. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, assume questions! [Laughter]
 President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. Don, think exercise various policy rules quite
 useful, colleagues complimented helping guide us
 using approach. quite properly point out, however, Achilles heel
 uncertainty. know underlying structure economy high degree
 certainty; least different views it. also uncertainty, often real time,
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 whether dealing supply shock demand shock. happens
 analytically approach one relaxes rather Herculean assumption certainty says
 really high level understanding underlying structure
 uncertainty whether demand supply shocks? analytical way deal
 end something definitive?
 MR. KOHN. think "both" answer. models actually
 differentiate supply demand shocks. effect do,
 noted reacting output gaps inflation gaps. perspective
 rule, ruler, guess, say supply shock demand shock.
 said that, would like mention certain rules work better demand shocks
 rules work better supply shocks, paper circulated pointed
 clearly. So, clue whether dealing supply shock
 demand shock making policy, would want use information shape policy
 response instead adhering rigidly particular rule. theory, know
 type shock is, could make policy better know.
 Concerning problem uncertainty structure economy,
 really complex subject President McDonough brought last meeting, one
 must admit sorted satisfaction. pointed out,
 older literature starting Bill Brainard says, multiplier uncertainty--if
 sure connection policy action response economy--that ought
 induce caution. sure happen, go part way there, see
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 works out, go little further. so-called Brainard uncertainty induce
 much cautious response would get Henderson-McKibbin strategy.
 hand, people done exercises coefficients
 known, slopes lines known, position uncertain. example, may
 uncertain position NAIRU quite sure know slope
 short-run tradeoff is. kinds uncertainties necessarily engender sluggish
 policymaking. would proceed basis best guess kind uncertainty,
 see happens, adjust later. So, different kinds uncertainty.
 real world clearly much complex. Various uncertainties interact.
 observe things happening; know whether multiplier effect involved. Things
 happening way expected; know whether reaction economy
 changed whole position function changed. know caused
 change, whether supply demand shock. think uncertainty counsels
 caution policymaking, would get little concerned counseled paralysis. part
 lesson see output gap opening up, best guess,
 something point pressures producing gap mount
 worse problem later. concern cautious policymaking get cautious
 problems build.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. going refer chart 4 following page 12 Bluebook.
 would like get perhaps also, Mr. Chairman, comment observation
 going make. believe true us polled individually asked
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 believe Phillips curve tradeoff, would give answer along lines
 probably none long run. would say various inflation rates consistent
 given unemployment rate long run vice versa. probably would believe
 shorter-run tradeoff. Comparing top panel bottom panel chart 4, seems
 strong Phillips curve built lasts years years. lot
 allusions tradeoff Bluebook seem indicate strong belief long-term
 Phillips curve.
 MR. KOHN. No, long-term Phillips curve built this. think
 little careful, President McTeer, scale charts. talking
 small declines inflation fairly small output gaps. sacrifice ratio built 3

 used first set simulations, 2 period 5 years, also consistent lot
 modeling empirical work done quite long period. So, short-run Phillips

 MR. MCTEER. guess struck horizontal axis vertical axis.
 seem lot years there.
 MR. KOHN. implied sacrifice ratios line using
 quite while.
 MR. PRELL. think model reflects importance price expectations
 process simple way. long-run tradeoff.
 expectations change gradually time, going short-run tradeoffs.
 MR. MCTEER. There's sentence page 6 Bluebook says: "In staff
 model, sacrifice ratio five years 2; is, 1 percentage point reduction
 inflation achieved pushing unemployment rate NAIRU
 equivalent 2 percentage points one year." end 1996, December, CPI
 inflation rate 3.3 percent, think latest reading 2.2 percent. come
 trailing basis full percentage point time unemployment rate
 come half dozen notches.
 MR. KOHN. think facing situation
 favorable supply developments, means short-run tradeoff.
 MR. PRELL. tradeoff sense, obscured big drop oil
 prices. shifted short-run Phillips curve.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. going address issue somewhat different
 form. basic problem model whole series consecutive short-term Phillips
 curves, structure change. accept hypothesis short-term
 structure continuously work change structure, results shown
 mathematically inevitable.
 MR. MCTEER. Life series short terms.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. short-term Phillips curve is. see
 correlation historically. trouble veers periodically, creates
 nonexistence long-term Phillips curve. veer stage! President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Don, believe provided useful framework thinking
 demand side/supply side. need think unavoidable. implicitly.
 So, explicitly? helpful forced framework think
 going policy regime respond. say model
 really care whether dealing supply-side demand-side shock; responds output
 inflation gaps. course, policymakers care. important us try
 evaluate shock occurs even cannot sure mean demand side
 supply side. think know mean. last 30 years, comfortable
 thinking oil events 1974 negative supply shock 1986 favorable
 supply shock. lot events shock economic system
 international developments: certainly Suez, Bay Pigs, Kuwait come mind.
 also domestic events like Crash 1929, Nixon's price controls, things like that.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 know whether call supply side, demand side, what, might
 want react differently policy sense depending upon think is--the
 nature events. potential interdependence based monetary policy regime
 think careful about. get back question may
 want exercise caution Brainard sense Bill Poole sense worry
 paralysis. suspect--this guess point--that extent confident
 dealing demand-side development, would lean direction
 caution. extent believe dealing starts supply-side event--it may
 asset market development--then need resist paralysis. reason
 following: may series developments one might characterize
 favorable supply-side shock recent increase productivity--where people perceive
 real rate return productive capital rising whole host reasons. reason
 worry pegged nominal interest rate approach policy market dynamics
 people reacting perception rising real returns increasing wealth raise opportunity
 costs holding central bank money. derived demand central bank money,
 pegged nominal interest rate policy would cause us expand central bank money. would
 unintentionally convert favorable supply-side shock demand shock. would want
 little activist avoid converting favorable supply shock negative supply shock,
 say Kuwait War, adverse demand shock. mean interdependency
 two.
 Sometimes talk terms happened natural rate
 interest something similar. translate things kind framework
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 talking here. think analysis whether convert one kind shock
 type shock, intentionally not, needs fleshed little enable us
 guard inadvertent outcome. comment want react that,
 would glad hear thoughts don't feel thought
 carefully need to.
 alternative wording operational paragraph directive, like
 getting rid "woulds" "mights" that. However, really want introduce
 words "tighten" "ease" directive even though clear language refers
 tightening easing conditions reserve markets. talking expanding
 contracting central bank money. know supply-side event, possibly
 demand-side event thought enough, effect tighten ease
 money market conditions reserve conditions unchanged fed funds rate. Conditions
 reserve markets tighten ease fail change nominal funds rate based
 derived demand central bank money modified external shocks. proposed directive
 language would imply actions cause reserve conditions tighten ease,
 know true. failing change funds rate would cause tighten
 unintentionally ease unintentionally, often trying guard that.
 MR. KOHN. don't think lot add said, President Jordan.
 indicated might react strongly demand shocks supply shocks,
 wonder that. really thought demand shifted first half year,
 starting position economy close potential going past
 potential, would want react rather strongly that. supply shocks, agree
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 said following sense: think difficult analyze. thought Dave
 Stockton briefing yesterday gave good example kind supply shock
 discussing. example equilibrium real funds rate rose
 increase productivity economy, point Fed would tighten
 avoid overshooting demand talking about. could kinds
 supply shocks. think, example, NAIRU shock different flavor it. So, supply
 shocks require differentiating see whether require eventually require raising
 lowering interest rates equilibrate supply demand economy. always
 obvious way going go tradeoffs go. Supply-side shocks
 difficult analyze come different varieties.
 MR. JORDAN. want respond point demand-side shock late last
 year early year. case became increasingly concerned
 really going related fundamentally supply side, inadvertently converting
 demand-side shock holding nominal funds rate steady. unintentionally
 creating demand, initial impetus came favorable supply-side surprises.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. found simulations chart 4 Bluebook extremely
 interesting. would like ask question opportunistic approach monetary policy
 chart. sure situation adverse supply shock positive
 demand shock causes rise forecast inflation, aggressive reaction
 terms opportunistic rule. one adjust reaction reflect realistically
 policymakers might symmetric objective function terms willingness
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 raise lower interest rates, seems could conceivably see opportunism line
 chart reach long-run inflation objective even beyond year 2030. looks
 though model forecasting increasing interest rates, think almost human nature
 begin question forecast. may apply policy strategy alternatives, think
 explicit opportunistic alternative.
 MR. KOHN. turn back page 10, see target zone
 opportunism simulations strong reaction inflation outside target zone
 outside zone indifference opportunism.
 MR. PARRY. That's right.
 MR. KOHN. certainly, almost algebra, right. reduced
 coefficients inflation outside zone 2.5 1.5, would get less strong
 reaction, would take longer get price stability. hand, think
 little careful. Look Henderson-McKibbin deliberate rule. case
 policymaker respond strongly output gaps inflation gaps, performs
 fairly well terms getting low inflation. demand shock, course,
 conflict. output gap opens going raise inflation strongly response.
 moving direction. supply shocks get conflicts. So,
 necessarily case policymaker puts lot emphasis output relative inflation
 would take long time get price stability. Henderson-McKibbin policymaker takes
 less time opportunist bit Taylor policymaker.
 MR. PARRY. see.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MS. MINEHAN. coming different direction, wanted make
 comments. found simulations interesting even though know
 nothing carried year 2030 reasonable level reliability. must say
 going keep using definition opportunism, would like feel little
 comfortable involved it. great deal good material accompanied
 Bluebook, going take digest that. reasonably sympathetic
 idea one reacts inflation goes boundary, inflation within
 boundary, one tries work harder output side inflation side. like
 theoretical construct, I'm sure way modeled way
 thinking it. need time assimilate that. discussion really helpful
 paper helpful.
 risk resistant change sheer sake resistant change,
 must say sympathy Don's comment Pandora's box reference
 proposals change wording directive. watching CNN financial
 commentary program 6:00 7:00 a.m morning. woman usually
 commentary Fed policy observed Fed's policy decision today "no brainer."
 really important thing wording directive May meeting, released
 tomorrow, whether would symmetric asymmetric. thought, oh heavens!
 change directive wording, make lot difference people expect.
 don't necessarily want send new messages wording change.
 MS. RIVLIN. remember, think something say morning.
 [Laughter]
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MS. MINEHAN. suppose.
 MR. KELLEY. change would give six months' worth new material!
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, that's right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. least said "no brainer" rather "no brains."
 MS. MINEHAN. Well, that's interpretation actually said.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. strike go back drawing
 board this. maximum likelihood estimate would take us 4 hours, 52 minutes,
 .4 seconds get issue resolved today. much time.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. change wording?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. ought following:
 try negotiate issue meetings. difficult negotiate directly here.
 figure another way it. reason people interpret directive differently
 constructive ambiguity worked. problem. looking
 elephant different directions. So, unless somebody disagrees saying,
 try approach. willing support proposed here.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. super willing support it.
 MS. RIVLIN MR. PARRY. Me, too.
 MR. MEYER. question wording symmetry
 asymmetry handled. However, practice set target funds rate
 describing terms reserve conditions seems somewhere
 embarrassing amusing. think time come make least change
 directive.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. PARRY. think could take us many hours discussion decide whether
 ought include reference symmetry directive. don't understand
 would take us four hours make words clear. merely saying English.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't following.
 vote Committee members Committee
 currently, concern general. don't go around room get quick
 statement everyone whether accept recommendation is,
 minor changes, accept it. find quickly. don't start,
 Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. like recommended wording. think simpler clearer.
 MR. KELLEY. would retain traditional wording explain public
 changing it; explanation released advance actual
 publication reworded directive.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, might useful ask members differentiate
 first sentence second sentence. may favor changing one
 other.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, thought that. ought change one
 one sure one acceptable not.
 two steps good idea. I'm sorry, go ahead President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. totally agree Governor Kelley.
 MR. MCTEER. pass.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. MELZER. I'm sure change gets us much. worry little
 reinforcing idea rigid interest rate targeting regime time
 thinking possibility alternative regime, though know decision
 longer-term future. Secondly, worry little Jerry Jordan pointing out.
 Presumably, could times maintain current conditions reserve markets increase
 decrease funds rate. would allow here, event might
 quite confusing describe.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. said it. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. think agree Tom Melzer's reservations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom saying complex.
 MR. STERN. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. would much like clear difficult wording, would
 suggest taking preamble portion applies second sentence apply
 sentences alternate wording.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. like changes. change federal funds rate,
 announce following meeting. So, including rate directive seem
 much change. also like clarity alternative wording suggested symmetry
 asymmetry. reservation would think Jerry Jordan raised
 interesting point.
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 MR. HOENIG. would like see clearer language. might want negotiate
 whether it, think definitely could use clearer language.
 MR. GUYNN. think suggested rewording raises enough issues it's
 worth trouble might bring us introduced time. would leave alone
 now.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. recent years moved direction transparency
 clarity terms making public do. debated years, example, whether
 ought announce decisions promptly. think much better
 announce them. concerned would happen released transcripts,
 aware adverse results that. think proposed rewording
 directive continuation movement toward transparent clear. One
 quibble words don't necessarily make proposed changes today,
 general matter think would helpful continue move direction.
 times one may want constructive opaqueness, favor proposed
 rewording points toward openness transparency.
 MR. JORDAN. think language ready prime time.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, like transparency aspect proposal
 much. However, current environment specific long-term
 goal, worry point Tom Melzer made. rewording going reinforce
 focus funds rate. One point Tom made intrigued me, though. could
 future point consider linking first sentence notion "maintaining current"
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 increasing funds rate explain way, might way get around
 problem. now, would leave wording unchanged.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. view improvement, increase explicitness
 transparency. don't see reason professional Fed watchers understand
 directive. think bring conformity say announcements.
 also object little idea new wording problem would tend
 reinforce notion control move federal funds rate. do!
 long do, say do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. bit comfortable proposed first sentence because,
 Larry Meyer said, do. focusing on, think
 update directive sentence. must say respect symmetry sentence
 worry substituting one archaic expression another. also feel every time vote
 given symmetry, different reason. vote particular symmetry one
 meeting, mean thing another time. So, sure whatever
 change make wording sentence going help much.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think proposed first sentence merely says
 directive already say press release, cannot see reason one
 would wish adopt rewording. current second sentence, find "woulds"
 "mights" embarrassing nonsense. think wording ultimate obfuscation
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 truly silly. Therefore, anything understandable English improvement,
 find proposed language that. So, happy proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. intermeeting period, don't try
 find mechanism communicate views question bring perhaps two three
 alternatives next meeting, sense everyone stands. words, let
 us throw issue table. could discussion hopefully
 reach consensus. issue rather tricky may end agreeing, example,
 first sentence second. Maybe find choice words people
 support.
 respect issue locking funds rate, terribly concerned
 move away funds rate, change language. think
 language reflect doing, see new wording
 seen reinforcing focus funds rate current wording does.
 cannot see that, provided Committee recognize rewording
 merely endeavor describe operate current regime. prejudge
 might improve current regime employ new language directive
 describe it. go back read early directives, look anything
 like current directives. Committee changed wording directive innumerable
 times. directive constitution; like statute terribly good one.

 Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. strongly support recommendation. amused yesterday

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, said agnostic, I. [Laughter]
 MS. RIVLIN. Fair enough. think view uncertainty fact
 clearly enormous pressure something, nothing wise course. risks
 are, say, still high side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree great deal
 uncertainty risks high side, certainly argues asymmetry
 matter confusing existing wording directive may be. right decision
 watch wait watch quite carefully. So, believe "B" asymmetric right decision.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairman, agree policy recommendation today.
 want spend minutes talking policy somewhat longer-range perspective.
 think semiannual two-day pre-Humphrey-Hawkins meetings give us opportunity take
 broader perspective monetary policy. take advantage that, want talk
 policy think would appropriate remainder year. way binds
 respect future policy decisions, prescription always respond unexpected
 developments data associated changes forecast.
 Based current assessment outlook, similar

 effect, pushing forward second half 1997 increases second half 1998
 incorporated Greenbook forecast. think path would put us better
 position limit increase inflation projected 1998 especially 1999 well
 reduce risk still sharper increase inflation projected Greenbook. might
 also note environment second half, least projected, provides unusually
 
 7/1-2/97
 
 good opportunity tightening: above-trend growth, falling unemployment rate, rising
 long-term interest rates, building expectations Fed action. window
 opportunity evident economy slows trend 1998.
 view recommendation consistent long-run simulations presented
 Bluebook. important conclusion reach simulations that, even
 given optimistic assessment inflation outlook base forecast, monetary
 policy needs tilt toward greater restraint prevent increase consumer price inflation
 time 3 percent. second conclusion, perhaps implicit explicit,
 putting restraint place near term enhances prospect required restraint
 modest, imposed gradually, done without threatening recession.
 think simulations alternative policy rules reinforce recommendation. establish
 rules would yielded improved tradeoff inflation output
 variability compared actual policy historical period. One reason
 require aggressive moves federal funds rate response changes inflation insure
 inflation lower real federal funds rate. Greenbook follows pattern
 assuming rise nominal funds rate 1998 prevent higher inflation lowering
 real funds rate. Another reason rules successful insure systematic
 responses real funds rate evolving economic conditions. consistent
 view increased flexibility response interest rates changing economic conditions
 might contribute better macroeconomic performance.

 interpreted decision hold policy steady last meeting reflecting desire

 rebound demand following slowdown second quarter. data since last

 comfortable recommendation change. also think light balance risks

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, although clear implication forecast
 Greenbook tighten policy soon, willing support

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. basic dilemma real world operating differently
 preconceived notions would suggest. know divergence

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. also support change, alternative B. reasonably strong

 might put it. First, although sure fully corrected past tendency

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation
 essentially agree credible basis tightening
 point.
 Let comment description situation find ourselves.
 agree description, sure much departure past experience
 suggest. reason view illustrated chart relationship
 unemployment inflation going back long period years. perhaps
 rigorous way go it, find useful way start analysis. Several things pop
 look chart. First, relationship unemployment inflation nonlinear.
 Secondly, NAIRU, bounces around lot. Thirdly, variable lag
 low unemployment achieved inflation accelerates noticeably.
 benefit analyzing relationship number years, may find view
 history simpler today earlier. Now, obviously several caveats
 getting analysis way. One, course, history relationship
 predicated policy time, analyzing contemporaneous data
 forth. think chart instructive suggests kinds discussions
 kinds uncertainty facing today differ greatly past experience.

 leads me, least tentatively, think risks remain direction

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, agreement proposal
 think, President Stern mentioned, probably need greater element credibility
 taking action right now. want sound couple notes caution

 However, seems theory reality slightly divergent

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. agree "B" asymmetric. Since inflation pipeline inflation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. would favor alternative C. Basically, rationale

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. agree recommendation, Mr. Chairman,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, think economy operating beyond potential
 increase interest rates eventually. also agree see
 early evidence, certainly credible evidence, wage price acceleration point.
 So, agree wait now.
 Gary Stern stated concern may willing act promptly address
 early signs rising inflation. certainly hope willing act promptly
 preemptively earlier year. concern going start see little

 changes BLS introducing going make difficult people outside

 something careful concerned about, agree
 recommendation "B" asymmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. agree recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, lot favorable reports
 period since last meeting, like everybody else encouraged them.
 time, Cathy Minehan emphasized appropriately, need keep perspective.
 level economic activity still high. Labor markets, anything, tighter
 time last meeting. data suggesting aggregate demand softening
 may reflect temporary rather permanent developments; don't know. Certainly,
 fundamentals seem place reacceleration consumer spending third quarter.
 expansion number occasions seen weak quarter followed
 resurgence following quarter.
 respect structure economy, certainly hope right
 changing way help us conducting monetary policy. know that,
 Jerry Jordan said. think careful cautious jumping unduly
 firm conclusions regard. tried balance considerations best can.
 me, would still prefer take insurance mainly seems
 me, line Tom Melzer saying earlier, risk taking insurance
 less balance risk taking out. also would make point small move
 would tightening monetary policy. goes back things said earlier.

 believe rationale moving today, think rationale
 public ready accept. need better job preparing public accept it.
 time, recent news encouraging. feel least little comfortable
 last meeting. support recommendation, Mr. Chairman, would definitely want
 asymmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, healthy humility virtue eyes Lord,
 think given voice certain level humility feel light
 lack understanding. Happily fortunately, conditions understand
 favorable, far holding. think recommendation accommodates
 uncertainties. recognizes state affairs exist, anticipates likely
 course upcoming events. So, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Please read directive old language.
