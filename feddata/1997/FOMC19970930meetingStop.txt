 So, prologue, tendencies think facing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Mike?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think Mike's oral presentation adds good deal
 clarity ideas behind Greenbook forecast. couple things there, however,
 strike somewhat inconsistent, perhaps could clarify rest us.
 rather high real interest rate rate makes carrying inventory expensive.
 may one reasons inventories kept rather low. cranked federal
 funds rate 100 basis points assumed Greenbook forecast, would real interest
 rate 4 percent would make carrying inventories hugely expensive. would like
 view likelihood increase real rate would bring much greater
 inventory correction forecast.
 thing strikes somewhat inconsistent relationship

 interest rates. think assume kind wealth effect coming "I-am-scared-todeath" 20 percent correction stock prices, especially latter occur relatively quickly,
 flow funds would stock market bond market instead long-term
 interest rates going forecast, think one might expect come down.
 two things forecast appear somewhat inconsistent.
 
 9/30/97
 
 MR. PRELL. interesting questions. Perhaps relatively high real rate
 interest recent years, particularly measured terms prices goods, say PPI,
 may something see downtrend inventory-sales ratios. Another factor,
 course, better information systems firms work with. Going forward,
 project substantial deceleration inventory investment seeing recently.
 level inventory-sales ratio remains historically low forecast. think firms still
 find markets loose, even given capacity utilization numbers, feel
 avoid need precautionary stocks hand. But, yes, always
 potential, especially anticipating final demand decelerating perhaps
 surprisingly coming year, inventories get line least temporarily.
 would lead initially period somewhat greater inventory accumulation
 forecast would followed swing toward much lower rate accumulation,
 would introduce bit cycle outlook. Whether inventories forecast

 much add question. certainly something aware of.
 stock market correction question, something chicken egg

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. think answered question part, Mike. also relates
 Greenbook assumptions one hundred basis point tightening 1998 20 percent stock

 MR. PRELL. "no change" scenario included model simulation

 accelerated. Even UAW assembly workers pay tied productivity
 targets. Firms seem increasingly willing move jobs areas labor scarce.
 extreme example mentioned meeting involved telemarketing firms, seem
 able locate areas relatively high unemployment. new facility area begin
 operations within month. Tight labor markets also encouraging, cases forcing,
 firms spend worker training. Similarly, apprenticeship programs revitalized
 building trades elsewhere. Finally, council members reported conditions remain

 informal conversations region's retailers manufacturers confirm
 positive picture. Retail sales manufacturing revenues year-ago levels, surpassing
 expectations many cases. Manufacturing strength quite broad-based, aircraft parts
 furniture exhibiting rapid growth. retail manufacturing contacts report
 capital expansions way. manufacturing plans quite ambitious.
 Many contacts characterized labor markets tight. Several commented quality
 pool people draw declined. Employers claim resisting increasing
 wages across board, although normal wage increase seems edging

 changes. Even favorable assumptions link growth inflation
 pressures, higher growth path Greenbook forecast yields unfavorable inflation
 outcome, justifying preemptive policy response.

 MR. JORDAN. Don, mentioned substantial slowing growth M2

 MR. KOHN. modest deceleration bank balance sheets fourth

 find relationship balance sheets money growth tight.
 Certainly, relationship M2 growth bank balance sheets tight.
 many sources funds banks besides M2 funds. fact, found
 relationship balance sheets M3 also tight. One reason
 banks substitute domestic dollar borrowings Eurodollar borrowings, tends boost M3

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Don? [Pause] not,
 let get started.
 think incoming indicators pointing clearly underlying trends

 think interesting event recent weeks, extraordinary acceleration capital
 investment. big increase capital investment late business cycle really quite
 startling. focus orders pattern, see suddenly take off. recall
 expansion capital investment started accelerate 1993 sluggish period

 substantial investment, insignificant part
 capacity expansion. also little doubt plant managers propose
 new investments anticipate significant improvements efficiency operations,
 ultimately leads increased productivity. look cost reduction,
 consolidated basis obviously nets significant drop ratio hours output,
 inverse productivity.
 several indications prospective productivity improvements may
 materializing. First, earnings figures still seem rising. early get good fix

 may recall, initial estimate industrial production based part hours worked coupled

 quite significant surprisingly strong rise electric power use, indicators suggest
