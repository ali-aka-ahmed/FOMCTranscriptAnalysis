 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, Fifth District economy continues healthy

 Turning national picture, hard, least, impressed

 Obviously, significant differences 1965 1997, least
 greater commitment, believe, contain inflation resist inflationary
 pressures greater credibility goes along it. think also
 striking parallels situation 1965, least early year,

 Let make quick comment those. said, Mr. Chairman,

 Furthermore, labor markets remain tight extended period

 course, turns ability United States continue attract capital inflows. think

 Obviously, situation could change. growth Japan Europe begin

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. wide range opinions way

 talking uninformed; talking people participating

 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Regarding Cleveland District first, bankers

 construction additional retail space.
 already excess space far concerned. Store closings starting occur, yet
 new construction planned put place. One bankers said lending
 standards relating construction commercial real estate disappeared last
 couple months. hears lending agreements takeouts arranged,
 permanent financing locked up, tenants signed, finding
 increasingly difficult rein people turn applications
 construction loans. Also, thinks extensions C&I loans,
 strong throughout region, may increasing further. Interest margins continued
 erode. noninterest expense side, mixed story. Several directors, bankers
 non-bankers, talked telephone expense dropped dramatically. banker
 said overall telephone expense--
 
 --is 25 percent year
 
 ago, software costs skyrocketing. balance, seen much benefit.
 
 3/25/97
 retail sector said even though January February
 sales came lot better expected nationally region, still thinks
 growth retail spending next years going average 3 percent
 versus 5 percent far 1990s. So, pessimistic regarding sustainability
 kind retail spending seen. steel industry,
 
 large

 three-year period, increase 27 percent productivity, without
 company would able sustain earnings
 able adjust prices far. said steel imports flooding in. fourth
 quarter imports 25 percent year earlier. sees downward pressure
 steel prices, then, oddly, said took advantage current situation
 marketplace put 3 percent price increase 30 percent volume. asked
 thought increase would stick, replied that,
 personally think would. top
 management team thought current market conditions presented opportunity
 obligation try find market would support price increase. found
 interesting shift attitudes willingness test receptivity market higher
 prices.
 Another interesting development view relates newsprint side
 newspaper industry. recall year half ago newsprint prices
 skyrocketing, lot companies put price increases home delivery
 newsstand. Now, environment newsprint prices plunging, asked
 newspaper executives pricing. told savings going
 
 3/25/97
 advertisers. Price competition intense volume ad space
 sharply, price ad space substantially year ago--an
 indirect effect marketplace works.
 labor side, construction unions expecting 4 percent average yearly
 increase next three years. think contract agreed May
 increase higher contract three-year period currently
 ending. interesting twist press plant closings Ford Motor
 Company announced going shut Lorain, Ohio, operation
 terminate jobs 1,800 people. news stories said workers
 going provide much relief tight labor markets area. That's
 people collect 95 percent high wage year wrong set
 skills employers. One press report also said auto industry workers
 wrong work ethic needed small manufacturing firms.
 Let turn national economy. want put different twist notion
 opportunistic policy. experiencing favorable productivity surprise.
 know precise dimensions, lot anecdotal reports hear certainly
 suggest occurring. circumstances, would expect prices decline.
 stable price environment--whether gold standard environment stable fiat
 currency regime--and favorable productivity surprise, would expect benefits
 wealth gain show higher standards living way lower prices.
 inflation-prone environment, would expect lower rate inflation. nothing
 mechanism way individual firms operate would suggest higher
 total nominal spending. think connection see micro level
 
 3/25/97
 macro level needs unraveling, look projections like Greenbook
 show acceleration nominal spending growth total demand output.
 would expect favorable productivity surprise, things same,
 translate higher real interest rates. stable price environment
 discrepancy nominal interest rates real interest rates, level interest rates
 would shift up. fiat money world, monetary policy failed recognize changes

 nominal spending like one happened 1960s, think large
 part story time.
 disturbing see growth narrow broad money
 measures virtually every major country world accelerated last 4 6
 months. Growth measures, including high-powered money, risen
 double-digit range. sharp acceleration occurred Japan, Canada, countries
 throughout Europe. Now, may world experiencing productivity surprise

 3/25/97
 analysis would lead us direction saying guard passively
 unintentionally accommodating acceleration nominal income growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tenth District economy continues
 grow robust pace. reported directors business contacts, growth
 strong across board District states industries.
 manufacturing survey suggests firms continue project strong production activity
 look forward. example, one high-tech firms, Sun Microsystems, announced
 plans build one million square foot plant Denver add three four
 thousand employees. Reinforcing anecdotal evidence, know District
 employment growth last year somewhat higher nation
 whole. know bank credit growing region;
 recently, seasonal. farm economy energy economy District
 good shape now. One crop, winter wheat, never better shape
 people's memory, excellent harvest year, assuming weather
 cooperates. drilling area, activity high, higher year ago, even though
 oil gas prices slipped somewhat, producers remain profitable. Retail
 prices generally holding steady, wage pressures continuing rise.
 directors contacts describe labor market tight, includes
 smaller manufacturers larger firms, Boeing Eastman Kodak,
 operations District.
 Nationally, think best way describe outlook say
 basically agreement direction Greenbook forecast, though see
 
 3/25/97
 much strength components. terms see real growth,
 nominal growth, employment levels, inflation, fundamentally agreement.
 comment specifically note concerns inflation
 outlook presented Greenbook projections.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, strong growth continued Twelfth District
 recent months following large gains last year. Although severe winter weather slightly
 disrupted economic activity January, seen indications large bounceback since
 then. 1996, District payrolls expanded 3-1/2 percent. Employment growth
 fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Utah--currently averaging 4-1/2
 7-1/2 percent. might note parenthetically Utah perhaps state tightest
 labor conditions entire nation; unemployment rate 3.2 percent. would also note
 one wants find slack labor conditions, would like recommend Alaska
 Hawaii, 49th 50th terms employment growth, could also
 choose broad spectrum weather well. [Laughter]
 Revised data indicate California's recovery accelerated throughout 1996.
 California payroll employment grew 3 percent last year, well 2.3 percent rate
 recorded 1995. rate growth picked areas California last year,
 although severe winter weather held employment January, February numbers
 showed another large job gain. fastest growing sectors California high-tech
 manufacturing, business services, engineering management services, although
 sectors construction, trade, real estate growing steadily.
 
 3/25/97
 Turning national economy, concerns February
 inflation outlook intensified recent developments. Real GDP growth appears
 turned another strong performance quarter following rapid advance
 fourth quarter. economy's surge recent quarters means operating
 noticeably higher level seemed likely months ago. judging resource
 utilization difficult, unemployment capacity utilization rates well
 estimates GDP gap taken together suggest excess demand pressures likely
 building economy. number factors, including high dollar tight fiscal
 policy, seem likely slow growth later year. However, think basic problem
 excess demand resources likely solved anytime soon unchanged funds
 rate. Therefore, see significant risk increase underlying inflation years
 ahead. emphasize word "risk" actually seen signs rising
 inflation data. fact obviously raises uncertainty future. example,
 difficult judge magnitude possible roles enhanced productivity
 changes labor market holding inflation. However, given long lags
 monetary policy, left, believe, little choice use forecasts gauging
 policy. best judgment point even measurement improvements
 introduced BLS, core CPI would still show modest upward trend year
 next monetary policy remains unchanged. forecast shows core CPI inflation
 around 2-3/4 percent 1997 3 percent 1998 compared 2-1/2 percent last year.
 think risk upward trend inflation because, becomes established,
 would costly turn around. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 
 3/25/97
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, Seventh District economy continues
 expand modest rate somewhat slower nation's growth consistent
 regional economy full resource utilization. However, activity number
 sectors stronger expected far 1997. example, light vehicle
 steel industries better anticipated. Production light vehicles
 steel rebounded first quarter following declines related strike fourth
 quarter. demand side, light vehicle sales stronger expected first
 quarter, although Big Three lost market share foreign nameplates. Orders steel
 remained strong. Incentives important factor supporting light vehicle
 sales, appear continuing March higher-than-expected rate 15-1/4
 million units saw January February. contrast price concessions,
 several steel producers announced price increases, Jerry Jordan mentioned before.
 contacts saying increases 50/50 chance sticking point.
 Steel imports remain high four new domestic plants come stream next five
 months. add 3 4 percent steel capacity United States year.
 course, know plants closed new plants
 activated. Adjusting best weather, housing activity seems
 slightly stronger nation. large national retailer reported sales March
 continued line recent gains year-over-year basis.
 District labor markets still tight. unemployment rate District
 states edged lower January averaged 4.3 percent early March. Initial state
 unemployment insurance claims still running well year ago. Payroll
 employment growth District lagging nation, contacts indicate labor
 
 3/25/97
 shortages constraining employment output growth. small business, labor,
 agricultural advisory council met last Friday, members almost unanimously
 reaffirmed difficulty finding qualified workers. representative temporary help
 industry mentioned computer programmers extremely short supply,
 programmers know older languages COBOL needed deal
 year 2000 conversion problem receiving significant premiums 50
 percent programmers would normally getting. addition usual reasons
 cited wages generally accelerated significantly, representative
 United Automobile Workers noted dramatic increases gain sharing, tied either
 productivity profits, significant union negotiations.
 Turning agriculture, Taiwan recently announced halting pork
 exports outbreak foot mouth disease. 17 percent pork
 consumed Japan imported Taiwan, U.S. exporters expected fill
 large share gap. U.S. hog prices increased sharply since Taiwan
 announcement ban last week, little growth projected U.S. pork
 production, likely put pressure meat prices year.
 received advance copy Chicago Purchasing Manager's survey
 March, confidential released next Monday, March 31. overall
 index area shows slight acceleration rate expansion, 56.2
 February 57.5 March, new orders production rising rapidly.
 inflation measures mixed; prices-paid component moved 50,
 supplier-deliveries component dropped sharply 50.
 
 3/25/97
 Turning national outlook, assessment economy changed
 somewhat since February meeting. still anticipate real growth decelerate
 somewhat second half year pace slightly trend trend.
 longer believe current conditions economy guarantee
 deceleration. growth forecast conditioned higher funds rate path
 February. continue see risk demand pressures outstrip growth
 productive capacity. strength demand surprising us since least
 last summer. Given maturity expansion, one would expect demand
 growing quickly without stimulus. is, course, difficult know sure,
 stimulus may stem monetary policy expansionary
 thought. all, given know lags associated monetary policy,
 timing pickup demand corresponds roughly expected effects actions
 took little year ago. actions made sense time insurance
 might overly weak trend demand, clearly conditions
 changed weak demand longer concern.
 Finally, puzzle yet seen appreciable wage price
 pressures, believe Chairman's discussion worker insecurity provides useful insight.
 job insecurity, rising labor force participation rates, temporary damping forces
 wane, balance risks tilts clearly upside. sum, agree overall
 picture economy depicted Greenbook.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, New England economy remains quite
 healthy. fact, healthier thought was. reported before,
 
 3/25/97

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, Second District
 economy shown continued signs strength first quarter. Payroll job creation
 remains sturdy, job growth revised bit 1996 early 1997. New York
 State's unemployment rate stable, New Jersey's fell six-year low. Benchmark
 revisions 1996 unemployment rates minimal, though civilian employment
 labor force participation revised substantially. Retail sales generally

 unseasonably mild weather February. Consumer confidence Middle Atlantic
 region surged new cyclical high first quarter, remains national
 average. Residential commercial real estate markets continued gain momentum early
 year; single-family home sales improved, permits build apartments remained

 national level, since last forecast late January, indicators domestic

 MR. GUYNN. economic picture emerges Southeast many
 parallels going nationally. time, reported last meeting,

 make point. certainly watch closely. bankers Atlanta also
 commented recently think multifamily market Atlanta may close
 
 3/25/97

 Manufacturing, too, seems slowed somewhat earlier expansion.
 survey manufacturing showed declines proportion firms reporting increases
 production, shipments, new orders. Employment, average workweek,
 index expected business activity six months also declined, expectations future
 capital spending dropped since previous survey.
 Tom Hoenig mentioned area, oil gas activity strong--in Louisiana
 case. activity pushed rig counts high levels, brought
 demand crew boats kinds support spending higher levels. reported
 last meeting signs energy prices would decline, happened,
 know. One directors close natural gas business noted supplies
 rebuilt drain last year's harsh winter, continue put
 downward pressure energy prices, particularly natural gas, period ahead. Shipyards
 along Gulf Coast report good orders. One yard Mobile particularly excited
 getting first order Chinese interests; four large container ships.
 sure, labor markets remain tight area, pressures evident
 almost uniformly across entire region. extraordinary pressures saw
 Tennessee area lessened somewhat. still get reports unusually large
 increases wages, still see almost signs cutthroat attempts steal workers
 companies. picking reports manufacturing survey,
 would underscore "some," increasing pressures input prices sense may
 beginning see also finished good prices. However, still real
 change retail prices.
 
 3/25/97
 Finally regional level, two new directors year retail
 automobile industry--one associated group moderate-size dealerships another
 ran Alamo car rental company recently acquired one new
 conglomerates. directors suggested last meeting seeing
 call "seismic" shift retail auto business consolidations way
 continue. think consolidations bring significant efficiencies operations
 important change bargaining power dealers manufacturers,
 think bode well prices consumers pay autos
 road.
 national level, like almost everyone else surprised
 persisting strength economy early year. continue expect slowdown
 expansion later year hope disappointed. raised
 fourth-quarter fourth-quarter growth forecast appreciably. expect growth
 expenditures housing consumer durables measurably slower move
 rest year. expect unemployment drop quite low indicated
 Greenbook. hand, probably consequence, also quite
 pessimistic respect inflation, whether measured CPI deflator. still
 see signs stress, excesses, imbalances except persistent tightness labor
 markets. said that, judgment risks somewhat greater
 upside. view stems mostly greater-than-expected consumer spending
 readily see, fueled either borrowing, lower saving rates, Mike Prell
 reminded us morning, possibility see additional kick
 consumer spending stock market wealth effect.
 
 3/25/97
 One offsetting risk downside, Cathy Minehan also mentioned,
 view outlook exports could change. dollar fall back even rise
 further, think certainly possible, growth exports could less
 currently built forecast. also remains strong growing probability
 increased wage pressures, although less sure fully fed

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want focus two key questions
 outlook believe shape decision monetary policy today.
 First, economic environment, meaning recent data current
 forecast, differ today prevailing July September FOMC meetings--which
 judgment closest calls tightening policy--and generally
 prevailing entire recent period asymmetric policy directive? Second,
 today's forecasts 1997 members FOMC compare central tendencies
 forecasts year members submitted February meeting
 incorporated Humphrey-Hawkins report?
 
 3/25/97
 focus presumes change policy contemplate today would reflect
 change FOMC members' readings fundamentals risks economic
 outlook. would natural assumption. However, comments least
 members last meeting could interpreted indicating already changed
 view monetary policy thought tightening postponed
 meeting allow opportunity prepare market. market certainly
 prepared! [Laughter] myself, however, trigger, change fundamentals,
 necessary push accept change policy. focus whether
 change fundamentals.
 Let remind basic framework underpinned judgment
 monetary policy period. worry two risks inflation outlook:
 utilization growth risks. utilization risk refers possibility
 prevailing utilization rates may already high inflation rise time.
 growth risk relates possibility future above-trend growth raise utilization rates
 still further, thereby aggravating risk higher inflation. Given uncertainty
 judge utilization rates, tempered inclination forward-looking
 policy actions given added weight recent data inflation labor costs.
 is, nevertheless, causal chain believe relying on--from growth relative
 trend, utilization rates, wage changes, finally inflation. are, sure,
 complications associated changing profit margins, possible change productivity
 trend, favorable unfavorable supply shocks, change threshold levels utilization
 rates. causal chain must heart preemptive policy.
 
 3/25/97
 Policy could said forward-looking preemptive willing
 act earlier causal chain. importance attach causal chain
 necessitates response flurry disclaimers around table last meeting
 usefulness NAIRU. intended respond but, frankly, somehow got distracted.
 [Laughter] enthusiastic champion NAIRU concept around table, let
 briefly respond think concept relevant decision today.
 concept fundamentally involves three principles. First, major proximate
 source higher inflation excess demand labor and/or product markets. Second,
 causal chain likely proceed excess demand labor market, wage
 changes hence labor costs, finally price inflation. Third, long excess
 demand prevails, inflation continues rise progressively indefinitely time.
 frankly would shocked us around table believe principles.
 sure, applying become difficult late implied
 relationships nearly tight case earlier. data
 suggest decline NAIRU. Nevertheless, principles must view
 framework conducting disciplined monetary policy, believe central
 decision tighten today.
 back outlook: different today data and/or forecast
 compared FOMC meetings period asymmetric directives?
 set later discussion position monetary policy, organize
 discussion perspective Taylor Rule. rough summary current
 utilization rates core inflation lower. Unlike earlier meetings,
 forecast shows continued above-trend growth immediately ahead and, result,
 
 3/25/97
 higher utilization rates next year two. current Greenbook projection
 decline unemployment rate much different projected last
 meeting, though would argue forecast believable many us.
 February meeting, Greenbook FOMC members projecting near-trend
 growth 1997, FOMC members forecasting stable unemployment rates
 contrast decline projected Greenbook. current data utilization rates
 core inflation alarming earlier, perhaps less so. So, want
 justify action today, look earlier stage causal chain.
 recent testimony, Chairman focused labor market indicators
 special importance reaching decision preemptive move, agree. Let
 us take stock here. data compensation somewhat mixed, suggest
 acceleration balance. latest 12-month increase average hourly earnings 1/4
 1/2 percentage point higher prevailed time July September
 meetings. hand, increases average hourly earnings rather tame
 last couple months. certainly hint hardly smoking gun.
 hand, virtually indicators labor market tightness elevated levels
 today: help wanted ads up, initial claims unemployment insurance down, index
 hard-to-get jobs down, consumer sentiment jobs plentiful up.
 key decision today change forecast.
 Ill focus Greenbook forecast, may aggressive certain
 respects forecasts. effectively serve make dramatic
 point want make. significant change current Greenbook forecast
 1997 forecasts prepared July September meetings even
 
 3/25/97
 
 February meeting. Compared earlier meetings, Greenbook projects 2-3/4
 percent rate growth 1997 contrast 2 percent July September
 meetings 2-1/4 percent February meeting. follows unexpectedly strong
 second half 1996. sure, almost always case projections, growth
 slows trend forecast period. combination stronger second half
 1996 upward revised forecast 1997 translates increase level output
 hence utilization rates 1997 1998. July September meetings,
 unemployment rate expected stabilize near 5-1/2 percent 1997. expected
 decline 5 percent year 5 percent 1998. underline difficulty
 making selling policy change, important difference Greenbook
 forecast inflation 1997 revised downward relative July
 September meetings.
 repeat second question, FOMC members change forecasts
 growth 1997 unemployment rate end year compared
 central tendencies forecasts submitted incorporation
 Humphrey-Hawkins report? part, see economy near-term
 momentum last meeting, therefore expect unemployment rate
 lower second half year 1998. result, revised upward
 expectations inflation 1998.
