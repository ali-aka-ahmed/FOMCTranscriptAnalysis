 Bundesbank's perspective, saber rattling two

 Now, Bundesbank faces something dilemma--or couple

 relatively strong activity, market participants. Surprises--even
 pleasant ones, like combination last Wednesday's PPI retail sales
 releases--tend create uncertainty, uncertainty needs priced
 markets.
 Another way view this, depicted fourth page, contest
 old new paradigms and, specifically, among diverse
 views expressed market behavior. "Old paradigm pessimists"
 think inflation break out; hiding lags.
 think Fed "behind curve," providing much liquidity.
 response last Wednesday's data, old paradigm pessimists would
 inclined sell stocks bonds short.
 "Old paradigm optimists" think inflation probably coming soon,
 it's hard tell. think Fed good job maybe
 benign inflation behavior kept going quarters. Many
 old paradigm optimists reformed old paradigm pessimists, whose
 pessimism became expensive thousand Dow points ago. Thus,
 remain cautious: buying stocks bonds dips selling
 rallies.
 "New paradigm optimists"--who done rather well past
 year so--think entered new era productivity

 "New paradigm pessimists" recently getting attention

 Moreover, revised NIPA data suggest profits much

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mike, want ask spending durable equipment,
 particularly technologically oriented durable equipment. Greenbook says sector

 MR. PRELL. don't want convey notion--and hope didn't state quite

 Turning national outlook, forecasts real growth inflation
 come bit since last meeting. However, big question still whether see
 increase inflation us forecasting 1998. Labor market conditions suggest
 may. course, labor markets tight years without major pickup
 labor costs inflation, become even tighter past quarters. Moreover,
 fundamentals appear place continuing real growth trend rates least. Consequently,
 labor markets remain tight foreseeable future. Fortunately, great
 deal investment recent years, resulting increase productive capacity least
 lessen inflationary pressures. may also entering era significantly faster productivity
 growth; guess part new paradigm. recent official statistics
 provide much evidence this. Moreover, even data become favorable, take
 
 8/19/97
 
 quite time know certainty whether economy changed
 fundamental way. Thus, given current understanding economy's growth potential,
 reasonable forecast one rising inflation. course, upward tilt inflation
 forecast relatively modest, view risks still clearly upside.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, Twelfth District's rapid economic expansion
 actually gained momentum recent months. Payroll employment grew 3.2 percent annual
 rate second quarter. Growth durable manufacturing employment accelerated
 first second quarters Boeing's expansion combined continued strength high-tech
 industries recent resurgence wood products industries. Construction employment growth
 also accelerated second quarter. Districtwide, sector expanded nearly 9 percent
 annual basis first half year. might note parenthetically last year
 construction increased 9.2 percent California, generating 46,000 jobs, 14.9
 percent Nevada. Normally, would say percentage increase large unsustainable,
 discuss Nevada economy, use word "unsustainable."
 second-quarter acceleration evident District states. Payroll employment
 District's growth leaders--Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Washington, Oregon--grew
 4 percent annual pace. Furthermore, unemployment rate fallen year
 District states except Hawaii, labor markets virtually major urban areas extremely
 tight.
 impressive turnaround California's economy continued year; payroll
 employment grew nearly 3 percent annual rate first seven months year.
 Although pace slowed recent months, state's unemployment rate continued fall.
 
 8/19/97
 
 California economic data also point continued rapid expansion. Unexpectedly strong growth
 state income tax receipts recently led substantial upward revision state government revenues.
 Also, recovery residential real estate markets spread areas state,
 housing prices statewide back rise.
 Turning national economy, recent data suggest next year so, real GDP
 likely grow rate close 2-1/4 percent pace reported second quarter. Like
 Greenbook, think underlying demand may somewhat stronger near term,
 firms likely satisfy part demand inventories. economy
 likely grow much faster trend rate period, conventional measures,
 know, suggest already operating relatively high levels resource utilization. Thus,
 still risk inflation may trend upward future. course, recent data wages
 prices highly favorable actually show modest downward trend.
 part explained factors higher dollar, part remains unexplained
 conventional relationships. inflation held temporary factors unusually
 small increases benefit costs higher worker insecurity change permanent
 nature reflects developments increase trend productivity? Taking
 factors account, best judgment that, remaining low, underlying inflation likely
 pick little next six quarters. instance, forecast shows measures core
 inflation going 1/4 1/2 percentage point year next. Finally, would
 classify old paradigm, newly found optimist. [Laughter]

 Southeast also changed much last seven weeks. still

 Southeast still "humming along," Mike.
 Picking Cathy Minehan's comments tourism, region's hospitality
 tourist industry, offers insight discretionary spending, operating near
 capacity major tourist cities. Future bookings well ahead year ago. Even
 new capacity come line--and coming--hotels offering fewer offseason discounts, noticeable impact occupancy rates. Cruise ships airline
 flights South Florida essentially fully booked, anyone planning speech South
 Florida, make reservations early!
 We, too, see continuing evidence slowing residential construction activity,
 one must look beyond high levels activity cities like Atlanta. Expansion construction
 activity commercial sector, mostly office buildings hotels, taking slack.
 
 8/19/97
 even speculative prices still holding up, leasing activity slowed somewhat
 sectors expect announcements new projects moderate period ahead.
 Manufacturing activity difficult read, appears recovered little
 since last meeting. latest regional manufacturing survey showed current
 production eased slightly, shipments, new orders, back orders, employment, workweek
 rose last report. Also, picking Bob McTeer's comments, oil gas activity
 continues strong Louisiana along Gulf Coast, number working rigs
 remaining high. Orders new ship construction booked several years out.
 Labor markets region also remain tight, old familiar story now. Pockets
 special tightness include information technology skilled crafts areas like marine oilrelated work. time, still cannot find evidence systematic run-up wages,
 wage increases reportedly continuing hold 4 percent level. fact,
 paper industry told last week company continuing get concessions
 unions protect jobs lower productivity plants. Employers telling us
 spending significantly pay workers spending considerably recruit,
 screen, train new employees.
 surveys turned new evidence unusual developments prices.
 latest manufacturing survey indicated prices received increased moderately, 75 percent
 respondents survey expected change period ahead. Prices paid eased slightly,
 70 percent reporting change. Consistent Tom Hoenig's comments, hear
 greater frequency reports sharper increases health care costs.
 One area special concern region Florida citrus industry growers

 $20 $26 million range, estimates doubling every couple weeks,
 mindful last experience California losses hit $200 million. So, could see

 view national picture similar laid Greenbook

 growth perhaps 2-1/4 percent similar pace 1998. also think likely lose
 ground inflation coming period. feeling need remain vigilant,

 national picture, Greenbook projection certainly reasonable. Like number
 others around table, still think risk error projection moderately tilted
 upside. major reports received since early July--the jobs report,
 Purchasing Managers' Survey, reports retail sales automobile sales--all suggest, least
 me, economy poised put additional upward pressure labor resources.
