 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. 250 basis points?
 MR. FISHER. Excuse said 25 basis points. sorry. I'm
 trying catch everything happened overnight.
 note, let turn domestic open market operations try
 get numbers right. fifth page, two panels illustrating
 developments federal funds market. top panel shows behavior

 Stepping back, would like ask Committee increase

 would like complete portion planning outright basis
 market get late year. So, time
 December meeting, expect want add around $10 $11 billion
 outright operations, principally coupon securities. However,
 given Treasury issuance bills seems increasing somewhat,
 also hope buy bills little later month early December.
 turning questions vote, would like talk
 minutes performance primary dealers,
 shown next page. try go background
 primary dealer relations.
 Criteria primary dealers revised February 1992,
 members Committee recall. time, identified
 drawbacks existing system. described one drawback public

 1992, also reiterated standards maintaining dealer status.
 primary dealers told past expected (1) make

 Trading Desk market analysis could useful Federal

 spells out, describing dealers, essentially six criteria
 look judging trading relations dealers. listed
 bottom page 6, include performance relating RP
 operations, outright operations, Treasury's bill coupon auctions,
 Desk's trades behalf foreign central banks, provision
 information Desk.
 Bluntly put, succeeded removing "Good

 time, hard motivate dealers perform. frankly face
 something moral hazard longer volume
 requirement. Previously, easy thing dealers measure.
 knew maintained volume, would kept
 dealer list kept minds focused.
 hoped provide dealers report cards
 could take home share management really understand
 saw them. decided want read
 Wall Street Journal. So, came formula sharing
 relative performance them, least first four criteria, without
 giving something could take home. following four charts give
 sense performance individual dealer firms, though
 enable master details.
 
 11/12/97
 first panel shows primary dealer performance financing Desk
 transactions. horizontal axis shows percent volume repo
 operations one dealer actually us, is, measures
 propositions accept. vertical axis measures pricing competitiveness
 zero represents stop-out rate operations, is,
 lowest rate operate. Plus basis points indicate better yields
 earn minus basis points measure poorer yields. vertical axis reflects
 propositions, ones take. average, take
 propositions. example, may accept $2 billion get $10
 billion propositions. So, average prices fall
 stop-out. first approximation, poor performance reflected lower
 left corner; strong performance appears upper right corner. However,
 another twist. dealer firm much outlier eager
 price stop-out rate, may say something ability
 finance elsewhere whether may something credit risk
 associated name. sense, firm lowest
 quadrant, hard know whether business financed
 whether simply numerous internal sources funding cheaper
 provide them. So, another element interpretation
 chart.
 next chart illustrates primary dealer performance Desk outright
 transactions. horizontal axis shows percent volume
 actually us. vertical axis effect pricing competitiveness
 index zero case snapshot yield curve
 operate. prices see may give us yield yield curve
 may give us less yield. Again, lower left chart indicates
 poor performance, obviously something toward upper right
 indicates stronger performance point view.
 third fourth charts show dealer performance Treasury
 auctions bill coupon issues respectively. horizontal axis
 measures awards name percent total tenders accepted
 Treasury, vertical axis measure capital

 Treasury's debt. ability matter capital.

 shown charts dealers last weeks,

 charts provide rather powerful indication absolute
 relative performances individual dealers sit. tried
 calibrate message dealers. showed information,

 could show performance period, would discuss next
 meeting spring whether wished announce termination
 dealer relationship us whether wanted announce it.
 noted, four dealers heard message. Another seven heard
 message near category. think understood it,
 thought process reasonable. Again, pictures
 charts rather stark, dealers much argue
 sense.
 wanted Committee aware process going
 through. think reasonable but, obviously, sharing
 solicit views any. want emphasize sensitivity
 data. assured dealers going share
 publicly, informed want share publicly.
 let take copies them, let take notes.
 want read Wall Street Journal, sure many
 want either.
 Mr. Chairman, foreign exchange operations report

 MR. FISHER. completely agree you. dilemma, think stuck

 Treasury still feels strongly, many years, existing system important. So,

 MS. MINEHAN. Looking first chart primary dealer performance Desk
 financing transactions, dotted line median -1.8 basis points. desire move

 MR. FISHER. No. case, would like see movement median
 volume line right cluster dealer performance around intersection two
 medians. auction falls vis-a-vis stop-out rate really matter much
 want propositions use. Forgive analogy,
 would like see Pete Rozelle always said wanted NFL, given
 Sunday, football team could beat football team. would like money market
 operation competitive. every dealer bidding reasonable price,
 would give us greatest flexibility. So, succeeded, might move median
 volume line 2 3 percent maybe way 4 percent, every one 30
 40 dealers getting roughly equal share volume. Maybe would 2-1/2 3 percent

 MS. MINEHAN. So, would like move intersection out?
 MR. FISHER. would expect.

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think that, practical matter, dealers

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Peter, domestic bond markets, yield spread
 regular 10-year Treasury note inflation-indexed bond diminished little

 MR. FISHER. Yes, think right. want put fine point it,
 think people market understand that. don't think people making

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. Peter, issue publishing standard

 MR. FISHER. share view that. developed measurement

 long time, people market asked us publish underlying data

 MR. KOHN. Desk Board staff using standard

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Peter, couple questions primary dealer situation.
 impression performance dealers deteriorated time?
 Secondly, know profitability current operations?

 MR. STERN. assume get sense going talking them.
 MR. FISHER. Yes, want distinguish two sorts information get
 dealers. conversations dealers, clear disparity
 among firms. firms rather well others not.
 also comes conversations nature underwriting process changing.
 Many dealers understand this. Treasury's use Dutch auctions, already
 disintermediated certain sectors feel it. think profound issue
 Treasury grapple with, urging grapple it.
 looked individual firms, see dramatic trends.
 quarter-to-quarter data helpful that. firms fine names

 Third, recent inflation performance probably fed

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions Don? not, let move
 forward.
 Something unusual going numbers system think bearing
 issues raised FOMC meetings last two three years. important
 striking statistic relates issue Governor Rivlin raised, namely staff
 projecting slowing productivity growth Greenbook forecast. slowing

 evidence one way issue.
 First all, disaggregate staff's forecast labor productivity capital
 deepening, changes labor quality, total factor productivity, find total factor
 productivity--the usual residual us taught interpret embodiment

 observing different segments capital goods markets continue materialize, could
 readily expect residual grow even rapidly years ahead. even total

 factor productivity stabilizes, labor productivity numbers Greenbook,
 best judge, probably much low. using internal data exactly built
 Greenbook forecast incorporated Board staff's evaluation productivity
 associated capital deepening, residual actually goes significantly 1998
 1999. one merely assume total factor productivity remains 1997 level,
 instead getting productivity increases 1.6 percent 1997, 1.2 percent 1998, 0.9
 percent 1999, productivity would rise 1.6 percent 1997 2.0 percent 1998 2.3
 percent 1999.
 know actual productivity data turn be. don't think
 staff predict this; don't think can; don't think anybody outside can.
 important recognize, Governor Rivlin indicated, significant part
 pressures implicit price forecast, responding, rests evaluation
 residual be. would suggest look data current underlying
 cost structure, clear evidence, anything, indicative constrained
 cost pressures. may recall earlier year looking quite
 remarkable persistent rise profit margins, also looking, given prices
 increasing much, slow rates increase total unit costs, two-thirds

 nonfarm productivity, though get preliminary estimate shortly third quarter,

 second quarter. Compared nearly 4 percent advance expected third-quarter
 productivity nonfinancial corporations, implies previously knew, namely,
 noncorporate productivity badly underestimated. Indeed, actual productivity
 numbers nonfarm businesses doubtless much larger increases reported.
 Needless say, important suggests may fact finally
 getting acceleration productivity statistics observing, indicated
 earlier meetings, significant pickup plant equipment expenditures.
 looked two ways: one, indication significant increases prospective earnings

 continued strong growth indeed acceleration investments recent

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, seems that, even taking account
 market turmoil happening Asia, basic economic case tightening policy
 considerably stronger today time last meeting even weeks ago.
 view best course action go ahead raise funds rate modestly today.
 modest tightening would great advantage putting Fed back play
 would allow long-term interest rates resume role automatic stabilizers.
 recognize action like carries significant risk. could produce
 adverse market reaction. could blamed that, possibility obviously
 argument delaying move. think key point delaying move also involves,
 view least, significant risk. particular, economy continues strengthen
 anything like pace seen recently, believe face possibility
 significant inflation scare. happens, markets get "double whammy." First,
 interest rates begin rise discount factor equity prices rises along it, would
 negative impact markets. Second, ultimately play catch-up take

 environment consequences kind outcome would undesirable. me,
 would worst case scenario, one really need avoid. would want write
 Alice Rivlin's speech, wouldn't want write speech either. tough call.
 So, strongly favor modest tightening move today. Yes, risks moving
 today, view also significant risks moving. seems
 recent, least relative, market calm might give us brief window act. believe need

 Ordinarily, would make vote increase rates form insurance rising

 Consequently, support alternative "B" asymmetry.
