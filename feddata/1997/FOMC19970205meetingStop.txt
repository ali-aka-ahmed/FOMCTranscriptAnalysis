 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Second?

 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Approval moved. seconded?
 SPEAKER(?). Second.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 President McDonough raised issue letter sent schedule
 releasing minutes. thought might turn issue present.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. follow
 practice releasing minutes meetings Friday afternoon following next
 meeting. So, minutes December meeting scheduled released coming
 Friday. effect press report minutes disappears squib
 New York Times Saturday. widely read edition New York Times;
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 fact, least widely read week. time newspapers like Wall Street
 Journal arrive Monday, minutes old news. Frequently, picked
 rudimentary way. unfortunate course last several years,
 minutes become quite accurate revealing indication actually happened
 meeting. are, think, important part increased transparency
 Committee seeking establish. Therefore, think unfortunate continue adhere
 release schedule past practice, though nobody quite remember exactly
 started releasing minutes Friday afternoon. long continue practice,
 important contribution transparency effort disappear weekend.
 actually ten releases year--the Chairman's two Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies
 eight releases minutes--in Federal Open Market Committee telling
 American people trying do. believe greater exposure minutes
 desirable, could achieved moving time release. Apparently, view
 held Joe Coyne others Thursday would day could use. would get
 Friday press, better less visibility believe desirable.
 MS. RIVLIN. seems like excellent idea me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one technical problem relating timing.
 would like turn Kohn merely raise question.
 MR. KOHN. think Thursday resolves problem. Sometimes, happened
 President Moskow raised question last meeting, takes revise minutes,
 reproduce them, get copies Reserve Banks available
 release.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thursday release would get press reports
 Friday morning papers?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. right. letter suggested Wednesday
 release Thursday release two-day meeting. make consistently Thursday,
 actually improvement proposal.
 MR. KOHN. Particularly since minutes approved beginning
 Tuesday-Wednesday meetings, presumably problems would cleared Tuesday,
 Thursday release would work.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. thought useful idea. anybody
 questions comments?
 MR. BOEHNE. think good idea. sympathetic it. couple
 things occurred me, would interested either reaction Joe Coyne's reaction.
 One Wall Street Journal New York Times likely get story
 reasonably straight, newspapers television networks likely get mixed
 indicate minutes refer meeting concluded one two days
 earlier rather meeting held six weeks earlier?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. feeling news media cant
 make distinction find minutes uninteresting probably carry
 report them. understand difference ones interested enough
 publish report.
 MR. BOEHNE. think Thursday rather Wednesday probably helps
 that, too.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Vice Chairman McDonough's
 proposal? objections change procedure? assume
 Committee accept change procedure, proceed recommendation.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. regard, would somebody like move approval
 minutes December 17?
 SPEAKER(?). move.
 SPEAKER(?). Second.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection.
 MR. MELZER. Excuse me, Alan. would release those?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thursday afternoon.
 MR. MELZER. go ahead new schedule minutes?
 SPEAKER(?). Yes.
 MR. MELZER. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. release 4:00 p.m.?
 MR. COYNE. 4:30 p.m.
 MR. MOSKOW. question timing: release minutes 4:30
 afternoon, isn't awfully late next day's newspapers. Don't want release
 earlier day?
 MR. COYNE. current practice release 4:30 p.m. Friday.
 MR. KOHN. Saturday papers.
 MR. MOSKOW. Right, trying get exposure minutes
 document explain policy, wouldn't better release earlier could?
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. could ask, Mr. Chairman--Joe, could
 certainly move release time 4:00 p.m. stock market closes.
 MR. COYNE. Yes, could. options markets stay open beyond 4:00 p.m.
 MR. KOHN. Maybe could consult timing. issue, Mr. Chairman,
 domestic market participants sometimes complain release things end
 day, particularly day Japanese markets opening next day's trading
 Japan.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suggesting would better release
 minutes 2:00 p.m. time trading information markets? Let
 ask this: leave decision Messrs. Kohn Coyne come
 optimal conclusion?
 MR. KOHN. Consulting Mr. Fisher.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. slow bit! [Laughter] President
 Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. know decided issue, mean say
 anything change decision. misgivings, heightened
 conversation. think distinction drawn transparency seeking
 media coverage, wondering whether discussion timing questions may
 lead confusion two. seems transparent releasing
 minutes available way them. little nervous
 going extra mile seek media coverage.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let defend Vice Chair's position
 would generally agree particular issue. purpose moving release
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 forward, understand Vice Chairman, give emphasis key policy report
 prepare less-than-opaque manner. many releases relating
 policy decisions tried many more, think would significantly
 restrict functioning Committee. presumption significant portion
 Congress release nothing. consequence, extent make clear
 release things, think probably plus rather minus. would restrict
 comment official issuances Committee respect monetary policy. would
 wish go beyond that.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. would I.
 MS. MINEHAN. wanted register degree nervousness.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. valid issue. start try
 manipulate press, would lose would System. Let us move Desk
 operations. Mr. Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Peter?
 MR. BOEHNE. question, Mr. Chairman. operating balances
 commercial banking system holds Fed declining. judgment
 start get range reduced balances materially affect operations?
 MR. FISHER. remain optimist level rate change
 important. sure single-digit number would material effect
 behavior--whether low 1 0, sure. long gradual move
 current level toward 10, last couple years, sure
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 magic point range operations impaired. hypothesis
 case progressively confirmed.
 MR. MELZER. follow question, Peter, made
 decision while, would happen change degree reserve restraint?
 Given banking industry demonstrated ability operate effectively smaller
 smaller amounts reserves, thoughts whether change reserve
 conditions would impact terms would reserve markets
 achieve given federal funds rate effect?
 MR. FISHER. don't concrete sense would anything different
 would every day. Maybe would intervene little
 currently. development could become problematic, hypothesizing, would occur

 meet required needs vault cash. every one banks

 believing banks still going operating funds market, even
 smaller banks, behavior, continues happen gradually, would adjust

 MR. KOHN. course, even banks need required reserve balances
 Reserve Banks end day, need clearing balances day
 end day. So, even every bank system unbound, think would
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 demand balances Federal Reserve, would able implement monetary
 policy. suspect might critical level, Peter. think rate change important.
 pleasantly surprised that, gradual rate change, banks adapted.
 guess continue adapt, Peter says, long rate change low.
 might level clearing needs operative needs rather
 reserve needs. Clearing needs vary lot day day. Peter still able get right
 average funds rate period time, might volatility.
 know point is. think lower might suspected was, based
 past experience. may considerably lower present range terms inducing

 Federal Reserve.
 MR. MELZER. doubt that.
 MR. KOHN. still something Peter operate carrying
 Committee's policies.
 MR. MELZER. balances gone down, anything happened daylight
 overdrafts? pattern observing?
 MR. KOHN. don't think so.
 MR. FISHER. agree Don. generally think cause-effect running
 way. change behavior daylight overdrafts policy changes

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? not, would somebody like
 move ratify operations Domestic Desk?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. move.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. also need approve
 increased intermeeting leeway Peter. Would somebody like move that?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval $12 billion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. second?
 SPEAKER(?). Second.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Let us move Messrs. Prell
 Truman.
 MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 MR. TRUMAN. [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. good "Chart Show" staff

 MS. MINEHAN. interesting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Very, informative.
 MR. PRELL. Ted suggests set low standard previously. [Laughter]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sorry raised hurdle; require
 work future. Questions either gentleman? Yes, President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. started off, Mike, think heard say actual

 MR. PRELL. recall learned nothing new level resource

 question alignment here. fourth quarter, Okun's law equations, found
 unemployment rate little higher might expected, given GDP path.
 new number suggests even greater excess. anticipating going

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.

 MS. PHILLIPS. done quarterly basis?
 MR. PRELL. cannot tell many quarters inflation

 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Mike, couple technical things: principal surprise
 fourth-quarter data employment cost index, know looked that.
 question whether satisfied found couple
 characteristics looked little line me.
 MR. PRELL. pick one widely discussed, namely behavior
 nonproduction bonus component benefits. struck many people Wall Street
 pocketing huge bonuses keeping reality. However, best tell,
 probably least part matter timing. bonuses paid mid-December,
 picked March ECI. could errant numbers reflecting
 sampling problems. Conceivably, firms big bonuses might
 sample. So, may still grounds residual doubt accuracy there.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 found smoking guns tell us look numbers jaundiced
 eye. reasonably credible, think.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. evidence Wall Street bonuses end
 1996 significantly greater year before?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes.
 MR. PRELL. read newspapers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. order magnitude? information
 got?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. major firms level
 approximately 50 percent higher 1996 1995. tax receipts New York City
 New York State reflect boom well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. usually pay bonuses?
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. earliest December
 paid end January.
 MR. PRELL. supposition lot discussion recognize
 good share bonuses paid December.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, seasonal adjustments capture
 change?
 MR. PRELL. don't know whether timing new, though think
 shifting time. part, inconvenient terms tax planning get big slug
 money late year. think considerations, too.
 MR. STERN. second question: estimate fourth-quarter
 productivity? 1-1/2 2 percent something like that?
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. PRELL. recollection 2-1/2 percent.
 MR. STERN. 2-1/2 percent?
 MR. PRELL. Yes. based reasonably firm view nonfarm
 business output quarter tentative view total hours worked
 ultimately look like. think reasonable handle it. probably
 2-1/2 percent vicinity.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. comparable compensation per hour figure?
 MR. STOCKTON. It's 3-1/2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mike Ted, question oil price comments. don't
 disagree projection decline oil prices. hearing individuals
 energy industry that, given current outlook world oil demand limited
 ability producers accommodate demand, increasingly mind
 prices stay higher longer. judge hear,
 inclination move away baseline projection toward higher price scenario?
 MR. TRUMAN. think two aspects question. One would relate
 short term, meaning period looking here, would longer-term
 perspective.
 regard assessment industry saying short-term
 supply demand balance abstracting accidents one sort another like cold
 weather Europe, hurricanes, forth, fact quite conservative use
 conventional relationships terms industry says new production coming
 line next year so. said, think medium-term forecast going
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 beyond period--and leaving aside little run-ups had--we might
 inclined shift almost flat nominal price trend, implies real price decline,
 something might flat real terms. inviolable arithmetic involved
 here, think almost everybody believes get ultimately. That's
 sense technological improvements come line factors
 come play produce result. Now, say partly background
 assumption Iraq stay put. assume Iraq reenter market 3 million
 barrels day something like that, postponing scenario 18 months
 couple years extra supply absorbed. one negative side
 good deal new production parts world stable; one
 example Columbia. So, might lower level prices while, firmly higher
 level volatility result interruptions one sort another supply oil. That's
 best do.
 MR. HOENIG. Okay. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. couple questions, Mike, following President
 Stern talking terms productivity assumptions. discussion
 Greenbook change thinking trend rate productivity growth.
 interested first moved rather upward, second would appear
 implications potential output. wondered implications were--they
 probably part forecast--and range uncertainty around trend
 productivity growth seem impact. don't disagree

 trend overall forecast. wonder changes came whether
 reflective something different thinking recently.
 MR. PRELL. aren't certain don't see anyone really could
 area. clung great determination assumption underlying growth trend
 decade would prove 1.1 percent. continuing reassess
 assumption, guess particularly meeting one longer-run
 perspective may important Committee's deliberations, took another hard look it.
 perceived trend line well 1.1 percent growth assumption clearly
 would fit natural way experiencing least third
 quarter last year. historical pattern productivity tends trend level
 terms almost end expansion, way end expansion,
 dips trend recession early recovery phase subsequently

 fit. Something like .7 percent gave picture looked like recent
 history. Now, may reasons earlier historical patterns would hold time.
 adjustments labor output short run may different, on. But,
 divergence persists several years, troubling pattern.
 also noted reasons think output, thus productivity, may
 underestimated last years. question much. One could look
 difference gross domestic income gross domestic product--a difference
 become quite sizable--and conclude production really much stronger
 data suggest productivity greatly understated. looking history revisions
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 little know might flaws income-product data, thought
 rather aggressive assumption true output productivity been.
 sense compromised. assume trend actual levels productivity
 understated recent years, enough us try square things assuming
 .9 percent trend growth productivity. fourth-quarter number actually reasonably helpful
 getting picture looks sensible kind trend line. Now, would naturally
 feed potential output assumption, offsetting considerations.
 looked trends average workweek factors get us nonfarm
 business output GDP on, led conclude estimate 1.9 percent
 period since 1990 still looked pretty good. So, changed potential output
 trend; still 1.9 percent per year, chain-weighted 1992 base.
 MS. MINEHAN. follow that: lower trend rate productivity
 growth, then, consistent mind unemployment basis
 change-in-inflation basis.
 MR. PRELL. another factor. looked Okun's Law. worked
 pretty well.
 MS. MINEHAN. Okay.
 MR. PRELL. suggest output growth lot rapid
 measured. also gives one pause because, Okun's Law relationship one
 depend quarter quarter even year year, extended periods works pretty
 well. So, gave us pause whether maintain seemingly optimistic
 view productivity trend 1.1 percent. adjust trend, also adjusted

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let us move Committee's discussion.
 would like start? President Parry.

 Severe flooding northern California destroyed large number homes disrupted many

 2/4-5/97
 
 example, seen large recent pickup office construction activity fundamentals
 market improved considerably District's fastest growing metropolitan
 areas. Office vacancy rates particularly low Seattle San Francisco Bay Area.
 Turning national economy, stronger-than-expected real GDP growth late last
 year related apparently temporary jump exports. suggests see
 much moderate growth quarter. Nonetheless, last quarter's surge still means
 economy operating higher level seemed likely last month. puts additional
 upward pressure inflation. recent rise dollar long-term interest rates may
 slow economy's growth rate later year. However, still would expect real GDP rise
 slightly trend growth rate year funds rate remain present

 regard inflation, expect CPI rise bit 3 percent year.
 longer term, however, continue see significant risk increase underlying
 inflation years ahead. judging resource utilization difficult, unemployment
 capacity utilization rates taken together suggest excess demand pressures

 utilization, appears unlikely containing inflation, let alone reducing certainly

 Capital spending plans remain strong. report says 37 percent respondents

 retailers means January better expected, similar Jerry Jordan

 Labor markets District still tight. Unemployment rates

 national level, like almost everybody else, underestimated strength

 1997 projected Greenbook, consequently expect unemployment
 rate move quite low staff forecast. good balance continue see
 encouraging happily leaves economy position less vulnerable regard
 inevitable shocks come along. view, risks outlook
 economic activity slightly upside and--as others indicated--consumer spending
 represents greatest risk. If, despite deterioration consumer balance sheets, strong

 exacerbated.
 course, tight labor markets talked watching closely,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, overall economic growth District seems
 moderating little. level activity still high, especially manufacturing.
 information District differs somewhat Jack Guynn saying
 Atlanta District. see substantial strength number industries--chemicals
 Virginia West Virginia, textiles first time while, lumber aluminum
 products well. hear number plants industries operating near full
 capacity.
 Labor market conditions, seems case elsewhere, eased
 region far tell. Reports rising wages prices--and
 information may differ little things folks said--while certainly
 universal widespread last several months. give
 example kind anecdotal information getting along lines,
 large building materials hardware chain told us
 number suppliers trying "to go price," use words. little
 specific this, special survey recently 100 firms
 manufacturing services sectors.
 manufacturing side, strong foreign competition still keeping textile makers
 metal producers passing along increases wages cost basic materials.
 industries--notably furniture paper, electrical equipment, machinery--we
 get reports companies able pass along wage cost
 increases easily case prior months. example, one producer
 electrical equipment said customers see understand price increases year
 almost inevitable. manufacturer bearings reported customers seem
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 resigned price increase later year. services sector, nearly two-thirds
 firms contacted reported increased business costs, half said expected
 able pass least higher costs customers. Again,
 tendency universal see considerably evidence get frequent
 comments along lines months ago.
 Turning national picture, projections submitted fairly close
 Greenbook, got different route. Let quickly explain that. used
 small VAR model developing projections. initially generated projections
 assumption change monetary policy, result increase CPI rate
 3 percent year next year despite likelihood diminution energy price
 pressures period. So, redeveloped projection assumption
 Committee take whatever policy actions seem required hold CPI 3
 percent, starting period immediately ahead. particular model requires
 increase funds rate 50 basis points early on. main point want make here,
 though, trying respond point Jerry Jordan mentioned earlier, 3
 percent CPI projection unconditional forecast projected result year
 ahead. consistent Committee's longer-term projection inflation based
 assumption Committee take whatever policy action seems necessary increase
 probability achieve inflation objective.
 respect Greenbook itself, say general contour
 Greenbook projection troubles little. shows core CPI rising 3-1/4 percent
 1998. think someone else already mentioned, rate would rise 3-1/2 percent
 except technical adjustments BLS. Moreover, language Greenbook,
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 read it, suggests risk error tilted bit upside current forecast.
 really caught eye Greenbook, though, statement forecast edged
 direction cyclical pattern inflation overshooting, typically
 followed monetary tightening period economic weakness. assume
 tightening referred possibility sharp tightening point
 road may let things get away us, tightening could followed
 weak economic outcome. hope whatever avoid outcome.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. District economic activity picked past
 months. Auto dealers reported flat November December compared year ago,
 expect pickup first half 1997. District auto production, benefits
 popularity light trucks, expected rise 3.6 percent first quarter year-ago
 level rise even second quarter. District contacts optimistic
 near term. Many firms announced plans expansion, tight labor markets remain
 problem many employers, especially construction information technology
 industries. reports rising prices, mainly transportation public
 utility sectors increased energy costs passed along customers.
 national level, economy relatively balanced growth path. 4.7
 percent surge fourth quarter, year's real GDP growth came rate 3-1/2
 percent, well 1-1/2 2-1/2 percent forecast range reported Congress
 year ago. Momentum 1996 absence significant imbalances economy
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 make us optimistic growth outlook 1997. projections real growth
 trend, continued upward creep CPI another couple tenths.
 Quite apart Jerry Jordan's letter, find semi-annual forecasting exercise
 somewhat frustrating potentially misleading. asked assume would
 appropriate monetary policy making forecast. view, appropriate policy would
 one moves inflation systematically lower next several years one makes
 objective explicit. approach would certainly affect inflation outlook 1998 1999
 quite likely 1997 well. fact, policy regime forecast 1997 CPI
 inflation would considerably lower one actually submitted. submitted
 lower number knowing FOMC shown much inclination pursue policy regime
 described, let us say members well, would result?
 forecast range perhaps central tendency forecasts submitted members would
 biased downward. would look FOMC group sanguine
 inflation outlook fact. think need concerned public
 interprets forecasts, could used decipher implicit inflation
 objectives. public learn 1996? February, projected CPI inflation
 2-1/2 3 percent range. year progressed, output inflation came well
 expectations long-term bond yields rose, yet took policy actions. Instead, raised
 CPI inflation forecast July range 3 3-1/4 percent. So, message
 inflation objective? think one could conclude--I don't say believe this--that seem quite
 complacent CPI inflation even 3 percent, think unfortunate
 conclusion. view far better approach would us specify definition price
 stability. Presumably, would less 3 percent. us suggested 0 2 percent
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 range, midpoint happens coincide Boskin Commission's estimate
 upward bias CPI. Setting longer-term objective timetable achieve would
 make forecasts meaningful public ourselves. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.

 question earlier Ted Truman, concern energy price increases saw
 last year may transitory may thought. Energy prices may come
 perhaps much originally thought, given conversations

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. New England's economic picture
 remains much same. characterized slow, steady growth overall pockets
 weakness Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island offset islands strength, notably
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 Massachusetts. Overall employment growth modest rate half
 country whole. time, unemployment rates low labor markets
 tight certain areas, particularly certain skills. situation especially true greater
 Boston area areas Massachusetts, local labor markets
 unemployment rates 3 percent low 4 percent areas. Rates low last seen
 late 1980s. Added Boston area, rising consumer prices, rising
 housing prices, low commercial vacancy rates, anecdotal reports lowering credit
 standards terms, general ease financing anything. So, get picture
 economy--at least Boston area--that poised boom.
 Despite this, wage pressure seems small. Average hourly earnings region
 increased 2 percent year ago, rise even smaller Massachusetts.
 contacts suggest wages rise 3 4 percent coming year, outliers-especially manufacturing--granting higher increases. Benefits cost increases, however,
 expected small, actual decreases workers' compensation costs.
 anomaly growing, areas close booming, economy
 low wage increases might explained several anecdotes heard recently.
 regular New England council meeting--this group small business people
 labor social services representation--a common theme developed. every case small
 business representative, whether automobile, jewelry, measuring devices
 industry, reported intense pressures customers--particularly large customers
 GMs Wal-Marts--not hold line prices lower year
 year. another conversation local consultant lot work
 told cost plus longer used method setting prices. Rather,
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 follows price-minus policy, looks adjust internal costs prices paid
 suppliers maintain improve margins constant final price environment. Clearly,
 pressure large customers exert smaller suppliers New England limiting price
 increases charge, prices pay suppliers, margins earn,
 wage increases afford pay employees. companies also face tight labor
 markets skilled workers, even small businesses. Even sophisticated clerical workers
 getting expensive businesses. So, considerable tension
 building, think greater sense last meeting before.
 believe similar tensions nationwide basis, evident
 forecast provided Greenbook, data compiled locally HumphreyHawkins forecast, many commercial forecasts. pessimistic
 productivity Greenbook authors, projecting somewhat higher potential growth
 rates. So, 1998 unemployment forecast drop 5 percent. However, even
 that, see trajectories core CPI ECI quite similar suggested
 Greenbook--a decided upturn measures inflation. see inflation rising now,
 though certainly signs wage pressures. given solid path economic growth

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. reports
 Second District's economy steady slightly stronger recent weeks. region's
 job market, shown signs slowing September October, picked bit
 final two months 1996. New York State, private nonfarm payrolls grew annual
 rate 1.1 percent November December versus 1 percent prior two months. Total
 payroll employment grew modest 0.5 percent annual rate last two months
 year, held back ongoing downsizing government. unemployment rate drifted
 6-year low 5.9 percent 6.1 percent, entire increase due faster labor
 force growth. New Jersey, private nonfarm payrolls grew 2.6 percent annual rate
 final couple months 1996, sharply earlier year. New York State,
 however, sharp declines government employment restrained overall job growth still quite
 brisk 1.6 percent. state's unemployment rate 6.2 percent.
 Consumer spending seemed rather good. Major retailers reported holiday
 sales region plan, November-December store sales running
 5.8 percent 1995. Post-holiday sales seemed quite strong. separate survey
 small retailers across New York State showed store sales 4 6 percent
 comparable period 1995, even stronger reports coming Manhattan. Sales
 perhaps unrelated earnings securities industry; apparel jewelry sales
 particularly strong. New York State decided take 1-week vacation 8-1/2 percent sales

 2/4-5/97
 
 however, somewhat slower sellers, especially furniture electronics. Discounting
 retailers lower required previous year, earnings seemed
 pretty good.
 Residential real estate markets gaining momentum, led mainly multifamily
 sector. apartment market New York City getting quite strong prices New
 York apartments going up. Another indication sort phenomenon old
 masters' sale Sotheby's last week, brought prices far expectations
 going sale. office market Manhattan continues improve. New York
 District therefore looking rather good. inflation rate greater New York area--2.9
 percent Q4 Q4 1996--is little better country whole.
 national picture, think GDP growth moderate substantially
 unsustainable 4.7 percent rate fourth quarter 1996. Consumer spending started year
 little forward momentum; housing edging down; think fourth-quarter activity
 nonresidential construction foreign trade borrowed future. So, central tendency
 growth still looks us near 2 percent, gradual drifting time passes
 expansion ages further. scenario, unemployment rate forecast remains

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. midst enormous plethora
 data impressions one subjected to, asking developments
 recent past seem significant. would like list six things--three
 moving three not.
 First three seem moving, would put wage
 pressures top list. seems clear pressures present probably
 strengthening time goes along. really important implies unit
 labor costs, don't think quite clear. would like know many stories like
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 there. particularly like example ran plastic moldings
 plants understand them. don't know widespread don't know
 productivity wage pressures interface, powerful input, whatever is,
 seem moving direction pressure.
 second thing fourth-quarter GDP, particularly message
 consumer back. question whether strength consumer spending going hold
 long-lasting whether temporary follow saw-tooth pattern
 become familiar throughout expansion. again, think
 powerful force, one point seems completely inscrutable. Consumer
 confidence, wealth effect, job formations seem indicate might staying
 power. hand high level consumer debt question whether
 exists great deal pent-up demand. questions would indicate GDP
 growth might fade back sustainable rate. supporting factors start go away,
 like wealth effect stock market break, consumer expenditures could actually fade
 less sustainable level could become possibly serious downside risk point.
 third thing recent movement dollar. know, stronger dollar
 tend weaken exports. also tend hold inflation check.
 three important things appear moving much. would
 mention first large number inflation indices. focused CPI;
 talking lot, necessarily typical. many price indices
 moving indeed number moving down. Now, determinative
 Committee worked ahead series past, sure
 again. think significant subdued inflation trend many quarters
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 now. persisted face regarded long period time
 considerable upward pressure, yet inflation measures still stays pretty much
 same. raises lot questions mind may going economy,
 would love get answers somehow. don't know will.
 Another thing seem changing much new driving forces
 appear emerging. new engines seem likely push economy toward
 either consistent strength weakness. seem enjoying extended stay
 mountain top Governor Meyer mentioned week two ago, knows long
 may last.
 Lastly, seem much pressure capacity utilization,
 without wonder much inflationary pressure likely emerge economy.
 bottom line nervous may happening result tight labor
 markets associated wage pressures. end day may important
 five factors anything else. enormously important question mind
 enigma consumer. guess wait see much potential
 strength stays there. all, continue think makes sense wait see.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. almost everybody mentioned,
 economy ended 1996 strong note. question whether single burst
 energy economy settle proverbial sustainable path,
 burst energy portend stronger growth path strain resources lead inflationary
 pressures. think corollary question relating high level economic activity
 year-end, namely even economy return sustainable growth path,
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 seeing pressures economy operating high level, thus straining resources.
 current expansion, sixth year, several strong
 growth episodes probably fair say monetary policy lot
 above-trend bursts, particularly least first half 1996. So, us make
 kind assessment current uptick economic growth.
 arguments return sustainable path presented Greenbook
 analysis reasonable. Exports, accounted much fourth-quarter growth,
 unlikely provide sustainable boost. number unusual factors
 fourth-quarter trade results, going forward strength dollar makes U.S. goods
 expensive. Turning spending, although consumer spending strong fourth quarter,
 consumer debt may provide something constraint future. expansion bit
 "long tooth" look pent-up demand particular leveraged consumer spending
 large items. related front, housing activity seems slowed recently, believe
 fundamentals strong enough least allow housing contribute sustainable
 economic growth. forecasters looking slackening business investment.
 Many businesses probably also recently expanded capacity replaced equipment. So,
 questionable long going see large increases business investment.
 suppose computers communications equipment exception. seem involve
 bottomless spending pit. Again, spending area least adequate keep us
 sustainable growth path. hand, fiscal policy likely bit constraint.
 bought arguments slackening growth going forward, let
 hasten point remain significant areas strength economy
 may room surprises. First all, labor market continues strong. Even
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 get 5 percent unemployment rate forecast Greenbook, still strong
 market. Although households may constrained personal debt levels, seems
 reasonable expect consumption continue level least step income growth.
 view strength income late, consumer spending could feasibly create unanticipated
 demands. think confidence measures support scenario.
 another area, business investment consistent surprise
 expansion consistently underestimated. fundamentals brought surprises
 could still present. include strong profits cash flows, low cost capital,
 ready availability credit, falling computer communications equipment prices,
 emphasis efficiency productivity inspired number firms continue invest.
 stock market another area always say room
 surprises. Either irrationally exuberant market fundamentally driven.
 matter verdict, either could provide continued sources investment funding firms
 wealth effect continue support consumer spending.
 leave us respect inflation? Although recently
 benign, hard believe continue enjoy Goldilocks, just-right
 economy forever without feeling inflation pressures. Wage pressures already reported
 anecdotally showing wage compensation statistics. Benefit cost constraints
 may run course. Maybe employers make increased costs
 productivity, hard count broadly view recently disappointing
 statistical history productivity. staff suggesting optimistic
 estimating new trend growth line .9 percent. Energy costs--and several people
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 mentioned this--also potential sustained pressures crude prices fall back
 forecast. think jury still there.
 sum, think arguments return sustainable trend level GDP growth
 fairly persuasive, reasons believe probabilities stronger growth
 accompanied building price pressures increasing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer, cleanup hitter.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. fourth-quarter GDP report marks
 extraordinary end extraordinary year. defining feature fourth quarter
 year whole pleasing combination higher-than-expected growth lowerthan-expected inflation, including declines core measures inflation.
 again? Three developments think contributed importantly extraordinary
 performance last year.
 First, sharp rebound participation rate hence labor force growth
 prevented strong output growth pushing unemployment rate even lower thereby
 pressuring inflation. Second, coincidence would refer positive supply shocks,
 including slowing rate increase benefit costs, decline nominal
 import prices, sharper-than-normal decline computer prices collectively restrained
 core measures inflation. third, level NAIRU may declined least
 came recognize last year NAIRU recently declined average level
 last decade.
 message certainly celebrate last year's remarkable
 performance, expect repeat it. Growth must slow risk inflation
 become unacceptable. True, came message last July, really mean it.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 [Laughter] also said even growth slows trend, remain inflation risk
 prevailing low unemployment rate. Still, immediate prospects benign
 economy near term, assuming, course, significant slowing growth thanks
 part inertia inflation process projected reversal last year's decline oil prices.
 still camp firmly expect decline oil prices.
 unexpected strength fourth-quarter growth does, however, put back
 picture referred growth risk outlook--the risk going forward
 growth remain trend push utilization rates even higher beginning level
 already beyond capacity. sure, growth several components GDP
 fourth quarter, specifically consumer services, nonresidential structures, exports,
 unsustainable, little doubt expansion slow result first quarter.
 surge net exports, important contributor fourth-quarter growth spurt,
 judgment reflects importantly residual seasonality component. means
 sharp rebound net exports posted fourth quarter likely occurred evenly
 entire year. bottom line although fourth-quarter growth rate may
 biased upward, growth entire year not.
 light likelihood several components GDP posted unsustainable spurts
 fourth quarter, comfortable staff forecast growth likely slow near
 2 percent even first quarter. Still, happens first quarter key
 forecast. all, growth 1996 proved unusually bouncy--2 percent first
 quarter, 4.7 percent second, back 2.1 percent third, back 4.7 percent
 fourth. Reverting back 2 percent current quarter not, therefore, settle bigger
 question: happened second half slowdown confident
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 economy slow 1997? could correct residual seasonality net exports,
 might actually see second-half slowdown. rate, former partners
 Macroeconomics Advisers noted recent weekly commentary, second-half
 slowdown evident variety measures economic performance directly polluted
 net exports--for example, industrial production, payroll employment, aggregate hours worked,
 light vehicle sales, housing starts, personal consumption expenditures, real gross domestic
 purchases, real final sales domestic purchasers.
 balance, therefore, still view economy slowed second half
 1996 helps comfortable forecast slowing 2 2-1/2
 percent rate 1997. judgment reinforced expectation federal purchases
 net exports decline, inventory investment trend lower, key cyclical
 sectors housing auto sales achieved cyclical peaks decline least
 modestly. However, continue believe serious risk outlook
 come continued above-trend growth possibility already operating
 capacity face result gradual progressive worsening inflation outlook.
 interpretation inflation year that, sharp increases food
 energy prices boosted overall CPI inflation, coincidence positive supply shocks
 mentioned earlier put downward pressure core inflation. believe, therefore,
 decline core inflation experienced 1996 suggests NAIRU 5.4 percent
 average unemployment rate year. suspect NAIRU, least near term, near
 5-1/2 percent. Assuming coincidence positive supply shocks repeated
 year, least uniformly last year, expect increase core inflation even
 unemployment rate stays current level. Cost pressures firms nevertheless appear
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 well contained, given modest acceleration compensation 1996 absence
 pipeline inflation pressures coming core intermediate crude components PPI.
 Still, acceleration wages 1996 indicated fourth-quarter ECI report consistent
 tight labor markets prevailing excess demand. acceleration wages
 combined rebound benefit costs certainly supports staff forecast increase
 rate compensation 1997 3-1/2 percent 3.1 percent posted 1996.
 staff forecast slightly above-trend growth 1997, decline unemployment
 rate 5 percent, gradual upward creep inflation take worrisome
 proportions 1998. still pretty benign outcome 1997, inflation measured
 overall CPI chained GDP price index projected shade 2-1/2
 percent. Still, main message unemployment rate move still
 NAIRU result inflation pressures likely build forecast horizon.
 However, inertia inflation process reversal energy prices 1997
 consequences evident 1998 beyond.
 Relative staff forecast expect slightly slower growth 1997 accompanied
 nearly stable unemployment rate. price side, anticipate something close staff
 inflation pattern 1997, including small rebound core inflation decline
 overall consumer price inflation. view risks relative forecast somewhat
 asymmetric, slightly greater risk above-trend growth greater risk
 already NAIRU.

 February 5, 1997--Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. Brian Madigan, would
 start us off, please?
 MR. MADIGAN. Certainly, Mr. Chairman. referring package labeled,
 "Material Staff Briefing Annual Ranges." [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Brian?
 MR. JORDAN. Brian, multiyear horizon objective
 getting price stability, perhaps along lines price stability alternative chart 2
 Bluebook, money growth would slower environment, based current relationships.
 Whether inflation, properly measured, 2 percent 3 percent, know. know
 measurement errors affect implicit price deflator price indexes,
 answer going 2 3 percent. Based information now, whatever
 assumption make price evidence Treasury yield curve
 behaves relative funds rate, confident maintain 5-1/4 percent
 funds rate, deceleration M2 growth consistent policy moving
 price stability?
 MR. MADIGAN. Given methodology forecasting, think really
 question confident nominal GDP growth would behave projected
 Greenbook. forecast money demand looking growth rates nominal GDP, making
 adjustment projected movements opportunity costs consistent changes interest
 rates. Obviously, staff could wrong, one source error projecting money demand
 money growth would assessment likely growth nominal GDP would
 consistent 5-1/4 percent funds rate. Another source would errors projecting money
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 demand itself, given forecast nominal GDP interest rates. Clearly, still
 uncertain point score.
 MR. JORDAN. distinguish among forecasts nominal GDP.
 target nominal GDP, say implicit nominal GDP target price
 stability objective. say objective get nominal GDP growth area 2
 3 percent analytical framework tells M2 growth also would around 2
 3 percent, least run intellectual exercise kind interest rate path
 would consistent producing outcome. Gary Stem's words yesterday,
 supply-constrained economy, get price stability task constrain nominal
 demand growth rate consistent aggregate supply growth.
 MR. MADIGAN. Yes. Certainly steady state, will, price stability
 achieved would see 5-1/4 percent nominal federal funds rate consistent
 outcome. guess question relates partly federal funds rate path take us
 steady state price stability. Chart 2 Bluebook presented one scenario gave
 consider best shot projecting sort interest rate path. involved,
 know, considerable increase nominal real federal funds rates next
 year two reduction nominal funds rate inflation came down.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay, chart 2 developed within NAIRU framework
 assumption know NAIRU current rate unemployment
 relative it. asking think exercise us abstract that.
 simply run interest rate alternatives presented chart 2 and,
 based statistical relationships money demand-opportunity cost framework, trace
 kind money growth would produced? exercise.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. KOHN. guess little unclear proposing, President
 Jordan. staffs view, would raise interest rates considerably get lower
 nominal GDP growth want. asking us would happen hypothetically
 nominal GDP simply decelerated funds rate held 5-1/4 percent, obviously
 money growth would come lower. agree arithmetic problem could solve.
 raise interest rates chart 2 case, money growth Brian said would come
 even lower would moving along money demand function time.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Okay. run exercise Bank where, take
 price stability path related interest rate movements pick chart 2,
 produce M2 growth 1 2 percent 3 4 years.
 MR. KOHN. totally plausible me, given 3-1/2 3-3/4 percent
 M2 growth associated smaller increase federal funds rate stable inflation
 alternative. So, lower M2 growth could well associated higher interest rates.
 MR. PARRY. think Bluebook alternatives helpful
 time. Certainly, provided great deal information issues raised
 previous meetings clearly interested in. Don, one thing wanted
 ask chart 2. calculating real rate interest, used PCE excluding energy.
 know cannot completely comfortable measure kind real rates
 produces, particularly present time. surveys, course, indicate expectations
 3 percent inflation one year ahead. comments alternative
 price measure would better approach real rates PCE measure? ask
 think measure misleading?
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. KOHN. agree tried convey point long, complex footnote.
 Maybe hard read through. covering briefing well, President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Okay.
 MR. KOHN. agree you. think likely people, forming
 price expectations, look whole array prices paying
 core measures. us, core PCE little revealing underlying sense
 happening inflation, abstracted CPI measurement changes related
 problems. So, core PCE better perspective, agree overstates
 decline real rates 1997. use total PCE, see real rates actually change
 little 1997. Indeed, rise little assumed decline energy prices,
 depresses total PCE total CPI. Real rates would go 1998 total PCE starts
 trend again. 1997, looks real rates actually rise tick, literally use
 total PCE rather core PCE.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions Brian? not, let start
 saying see significant change dilemma recent
 meetings longer-run objectives. would stick little bush next tree Brian's
 chart reverse pattern slightly. [Laughter] moment alter long-term ranges,
 effectively saying M2 back play. start evaluate
 markets respond saying. go Bluebook alternative II, implies
 monetary aggregates back play, raises question whether willing
 sanction amounts nominal GDP growth perhaps 6 percent implications
 prices. seriously question whether would gain anything value monetary policy
 debates.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 Looking chart Brian put together, aside wonderful
 colorfulness, show something really fascinating--which suspected couple quarters
 ago--namely slope new curve seems close slope old curve.
 presumption merely form dummy variable type shift
 contradicted data, indeed may go back were. may recall
 last time discussion staff forecast M2 toward upper end 1
 5 percent range, indeed staff came right button. reason
 assumed new relationships, indeed new relationships held.
 think little lost staying alternative
 watching going merely would indicating ranges
 something significance. change them, think put play wholly new set
 issues address think prepared come
 conclusion. consequence, close last time, would
 curious hear counterarguments others.
 MR. MEYER. Could raise question, Mr. Chairman? indicated
 2 6 percent M2 range would viewed sanctioning 6 percent nominal income growth,
 little surprised. Would say that, consistent way ranges used
 past, would take increase money growth range justify tightening
 policy?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, necessarily.
 MR. MEYER. could say, all, higher range centered 4 percent,
 would centered 4 percent nominal income growth 2 percent real growth.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 Could one justify tightening policy growth moved toward top range?
 question.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. could, exactly type problem
 terribly certain want get involved with. words, take added burden
 uncertain relationships stage?
 MR. MEYER. key.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think conveys anything cannot
 convey means. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. think really simple. seems unless made terribly
 sophisticated arguments, moving higher range would interpreted less vigilance
 inflation are.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. cant offer counterargument, Mr. Chairman,
 think would extraordinarily unwise shift present ranges higher
 ones. First all, would give wrong signal monetary policy. Secondly, even
 Brian's tree without bush, probably need tighten 1997. would get us
 debate would talking M's Y's foolishness rather
 concentrating price stability need say American economy.
 think ought spend energy talking about.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, agree analysis regarding M2,
 would favor alternative pretty much reasons stated. Whatever range set M2,
 though, think would agree numerical ranges aggregates stage
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 game really sufficient convey completely longer-run strategy public
 Congress. void there. personal preference would Committee fill
 void explicit multiyear inflation targets leading ultimately price stability.
 Committee willing yet. situation, Mr. Chairman, think
 biannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony principal channel Committee uses
 convey longer-term strategy Congress public generally. given that, hope
 presumptuous make couple quick suggestions regarding testimony.
 thought Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last July particularly constructive
 included fairly extensive section, recall, reviewed basis
 Committee's focus price stability longer-term target. section also asserted
 couple tactical principles guide us short run: one want hold line
 inflation; would willing take preemptive action, necessary, get
 want go. thought discussion section
 helpful, constructive, would urge regular matter, least time being,
 section like testimony way building support long-term price
 stability objective taking us step toward tying longer-term inflation
 expectations.
 respect upcoming testimony, think would excellent occasion
 make couple points. One could use testimony opportunity indicate
 really remarkable degree consensus among central bankers professional economists-which thought especially evident Jackson Hole conference--that long-term price
 stability principal goal monetary policy. Also, think would excellent
 opportunity note Committee discussing approach inflation
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 objectives couple years. still long way complete agreement
 might done, think achieved substantial agreement least point that,
 minimum, want conduct monetary policy way hold line inflation.
 thought really remarkable degree consensus one point meeting
 Committee July. far least, sensed change general sentiment
 morning. think would appropriate try convey clear sense extent
 strength consensus, could. Beyond that, speaking strictly myself,
 would hope might consider taking additional step explicitly defining line
 trying hold number, specifically 3 percent CPI, way pre-committing
 little concretely.
 case, think making points would help move us along road
 want travel long run. longer-term strategy obviously must credible
 going successful. going credible, strong understanding
 support Congress public, think testimony obviously key vehicle
 building understanding support. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let respond briefly. agree everything
 said, indeed get later remarks relate precisely question. one
 issue think ought begin focus suitability CPI measure
 anything. Bureau Economic Analysis Commerce long since decided
 flawed index, PCE deflation process BEA deviated quite significantly
 structure CPI. spending much time looking biases
 CPI, come view index going own. becoming increasingly
 political number less economic number. reason say
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 making economic judgments, including staff here, beginning move away CPI
 reliable measure goal inflation. talk price objectives, hope
 lock index. agree non-numerical approach
 vague without merit. approach two seems far
 sensible direction. reason number years ago thought
 defining price stability, terms number essentially terms expectations
 actions, viable concept. Obviously, goal that,
 number form. So, area disagree thrust remarks
 implication CPI may guiding tool. hope within two years CPI rarely
 discussed meetings.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, mean put much weight CPI.
 really trying emphasize extent quantify inflation goal would
 seem one step direction tying expectations. better number
 use combination numbers communicate inflation goal expressed
 would fine.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. impression Committee effect
 focusing lot different price indexes, growing consensus here,
 suggest, bringing inflation time healthy long-term growth viability
 American economy. agree consensus. said, would little concerned
 getting explicit putting number publicly. mind talking
 internally. think explicit discussions, better,
 understand exactly one us is. little concerned going public even
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. think address issue want addressed, agree
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 ought to, without getting explicit respect number. start using
 number, range numbers, bring woodwork people want get
 would consider irresponsible debates us. would us much
 harm, would take away limited time things. So,
 know, always cautious releasing number public.
 addresses issue Jerry Jordan raising well. disagree
 concept reduction inflation time. don't see advantages
 putting public timetable. think evidence suggests persuasively
 would affect so-called sacrifice tradeoffs relationships bearing ability
 bring inflation rate without concurrent slowing economic activity. think
 evidence muddled best. ought focus issue, hope
 move direction publishing price range targets long lead times. would
 great difficulty adhering them, think would make policy moving toward
 stable price level difficult would political problems deal
 along way. think would far better served creating numbers really
 cannot lock realistic manner could forced politically
 release them.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. make comment? think
 know, traveling along road Damascus issue. believe
 virtually every time speak anything, refer theme price stability, wonders
 price stability, merits society. certain stage trip Damascus, thought
 would helpful us establish publicly price range objective. backed
 view time largely because, Chairman suggesting, think
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 would lock us horrendous political debate would greatly benefit country
 would provide opportunities really want debauch currency come forward
 forum make recommendations. probably would
 concern, seems me, people sometimes describe hairshirts want
 grind inflation fear greater inflation. think Greenspan definition--that price
 stability reached people concerned future inflation make
 decisions--probably serves us lot better terms forcing debate right direction,
 getting sterile numbers debate, really getting goal want achieve.
 certainly pragmatism rather anything disguised economic theory. started
 notion would benefit setting number, specific number range,
 think practical matter could hurt effort achieve price stability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. going comment, Alan, understand
 saying political side. side, seems fair say rather large
 uncertainty premium real rates respect future inflation. Expectations 3 percent
 inflation seem fairly widespread, guess considerable amount
 uncertainty surrounding expectations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. 3 percent inflation rate measured CPI?
 MR. MELZER. Yes, guess right. I'm talking surveys; believe
 surveys economists' projections based CPI. think fairly
 high uncertainty premium concern going this. So, believe
 economic costs associated explicit. tradeoff
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 political risk one hand perhaps real economic costs
 associated uncertainty may cause explicit about-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. question, Tom, really gets issue
 evidence making explicit statements actually alters risk premium.
 MR. MELZER. understand said it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think monetary policy action it.
 evidence experience words slightest effect. helped
 Bundesbank, helped Bundesbank, going help anybody?
 Bundesbank succeeded taken effective actions. do,
 say, going matter.
 MR. MELZER. regard probably made significant point
 suggesting ought start explicit among ourselves.
 anticipate discussion next half hour hour due course here. may
 something could pursue anticipation next Humphrey- Hawkins meeting. think
 getting explicit among would good starting point sure
 everybody page respect want go think
 going get there--over time frame forth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus raising that. raising,
 think, interesting question. think everyone around table shares essentially
 philosophical economic base. view economy functions.
 different views happening, nobody says best way get
 inflation rev economy. indeed view held substantial
 number academic fraternity. argument accelerating economy brought
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 unit costs accordingly brought prices. view rarely expressed days,
 never heard expressed around table.
 MR. MELZER. mean suggest that! I'm saying think would
 useful explicit among respect measures ought
 focusing on, want get those, time frame. think said
 thing. problem explicit respect using numbers
 internally, politically saw risk putting number public.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, think explicit internally
 discuss issue among ourselves, better. honestly say asked
 go around table make speech subject everyone could it.
 would surprised explicit been. So, doubt issue lack
 understanding stand. think pretty clear
 different circumstances. one would dispute are, Tom. [Laughter]
 MR. MELZER. wasn't worried that.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, could make one brief comment? don't
 want push hard, certainly respect views views Vice
 Chairman expressed well. would make point although actions
 Bundesbank certainly key success also mandate think part
 equation. right noting empirical evidence effectiveness
 precommitment price stability using words limited, number data points also
 limited. really not-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say conclusion work.
 said evidence working lacking.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Okay, trying soften conclusions draw
 point. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think somewhat different
 perspective monetary aggregate ranges, want share you. Someone
 suggested main reason want raise target ranges raising
 would suggest less vigilance part respect inflation. way
 would make decision. think real key whether confidence
 reliability M2 relationship economic activity.
 important issue target range; central issue
 interpretation range. way interpreting today seems contrary
 view Humphrey-Hawkins language. language asks us, believe, establish target

 --one perhaps occur sometime future--of price stability normal velocity

 sense go back former practice believe relationship M2 economic

 interpretation willing live year,
 would say 2 6 percent range would make sense centered 4 percent: 2

 1 percent measured inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sure anyone around would disagree
 formulation. ought point out, however, Humphrey-Hawkins also requires
 unemployment goals, used discussed Administration CEA though
 think forgot last couple reports. happened
 Humphrey-Hawkins many goals 1978 legislation probably
 anachronisms enacted. Remember, originally drafted legislation
 explicitly took Friedmanesque view money relationships. never contemplated
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 Humphrey-Hawkins developments involving type squiggly red line Brian Madigan
 shows chart. Consequently, us fix 1978 paradigm clearly proved rather
 faulty historical context raises question whether slavishly adhere
 something legal force unless think desirable. But, clearly, conclude
 M2 back play, think way put exactly right.
 MR. MEYER. Humphrey-Hawkins mandate us anything;
 explain not.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. agree exactly way formulated it.
 MR. MEYER. One thing might, Mr. Chairman:
 discussion explicit ought respect inflation targets inflation
 ranges. thought this, seemed far away
 wanted get, vaguer definition price stability perfectly adequate.
 fact definition desirable meant sit
 worry whether appropriate index PCE CPI, worry
 core overall inflation operational decisions. get closer
 want be, least around table, Tom Melzer suggested, might worthwhile
 us share little price stability means us think help us
 focus deliberations going.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May ask preventing us that?
 anything way structure meeting that?
 MR. MEYER. think way meetings really

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't think disagreement that,
 let ask this. anyone suggestions might alter structure

 discussion, want make sure blindsided something. Vice
 Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. think could make meetings

 said something; along members commented it. useful
 exchange minds views morning while, think
 good. believe would desirable meeting structure encourages
 discussion. Part think also longer people here--I five
 years now--the use shorthand. Somebody says something three words,
 actually equivalent six paragraphs know, said, everybody's
 views are.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Joke number 473.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Exactly.
 MS. MINEHAN. everyone laughs!
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. PARRY. certainly support recommendation Bluebook alternative
 basically reasons mentioned. seems me, would emphasize this,
 raising ranges would cause unwarranted focus aggregates. confident
 point velocity sufficiently stable warrant change ranges. also worry
 possibility increase would misinterpreted terms resolve achieve price
 stability. So, strongly favor alternative I.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. add footnote earlier discussion explicit:
 really remarkably good track record last 15 years, think track
 record based good combination solid economics pragmatism.
 15-year record; good 5-year record, good 1-year record. go forward, think
 need cautious changing mix made us successful past.
 may need that, inflation come down, many explicit debates
 number ought be, think done deeds. one
 issues full-scale debate could good ideal sense. also one
 topics easily demagogued, get thrown substantive
 reasons. So, would cautious changing worked us long period
 time brought us much success. sum, generally sympathetic, Mr. Chairman,
 mix good economics pragmatism led us point. encouraging
 going forward, think probably going achieve success next
 years.
 specific issue hand, find Brian's exhibit 1 velocity M2
 encouraging regard potential future usefulness M2 monetary policy.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 really that--encouraging potential future usefulness. ought continue watch
 M2, whatever decision need make next months monetary policy
 would easier make cluttered M2, secure foundation.
 So, support alternative I.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. I, too, support alternative reasons cited,
 anything add there. let comment little couple issues.
 First, regard explicit inflation target would go public with,
 would tread cautiously direction political risks
 identified. also see operational economic risks. referring risk
 announcing objective that, course, would obligated try achieve. view,
 supported work done Bank, could result serious instrument
 instability adverse consequences real economy unless careful
 spell intend do. suggests need proposal
 thought carefully, seen proposal. believe
 done analysis would required.
 second comment relates question whether
 kinds discussions. would suggest may quite diplomatic
 discussion around table, believe turns rehash Beigebook
 beginning economic discussions could shortened dispensed could
 spend time discussing would describe fundamental policy issues.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let say something came mind yesterday
 afternoon. read Beigebook, listened discussion around table. two
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 separate samples. Around table, thought far greater concern economic
 strength associated inflationary pressures appeared last Beigebook.
 MR. STERN. Well, suggestion would dispense District
 reports altogether, think could highlight things different outliers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let tell this. don't know whether speak
 rest us Board, surely speak myself. find individual reports
 interpretations going Districts new information
 available either Beigebook elsewhere. would reluctant suggest
 discontinue making reports end academic discussion
 conduct policy, fewer facts concepts. [Laughter]
 terribly certain would improve balance. So, turns need
 discussion, think put separate element.
 MR. STERN. right.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. particular ideas want put
 table discussion, let us know. reason members Committee
 cannot present specific ideas think relevant. lay part seminar. rest
 us discuss it. Vice Chair says, lead things. need
 us maintain existing structure observe meeting. occasion
 constrained time; meetings not. somebody told
 finish 10:00 a.m. today, looking agenda morning, bet
 could done it. [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. goodness!
 MR. BROADDUS. Three minutes go!
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. risk proving point here, [laughter] let say
 agree alternatives. regard issue raised earlier discussion,
 little nervous picking inflation number target path. That's
 wouldn't like see lower inflation happen, see problems. noticed morning's
 discussion least two interpretations monetary aggregate ranges within
 group. went outside room, number meanings would multiplied
 however much. would problem inflation targets. words,
 event occurs, mean thing you? think could begin
 talking wrong things environment reminiscent debate
 many angels dance head pin. want careful sense
 right migrating CPI PCE. really discussed
 issue appear migrating there. So, 2 percent inflation rate may mean something
 different migrate. cautious picking numbers. me,
 inflation number zero whatever measure, matters affects us moving
 either toward away number, whatever measure. think
 keep front us.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. issue Mike Moskow raising yesterday
 CPI.
 MR. HOENIG. think so.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Alan, favor adopting provisional ranges, alternative I.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 issue raised whether anything impeding discussions
 could foster them, seems would useful ask FOMC
 staff--Board Bank staff--to research issue Tom Hoenig talking about. Perhaps
 could take look various measures lay us pros cons
 measures, indicate might constitute price stability view, and--I don't know
 possible--what might constitute price stability one measure versus another extent
 biases identified. think would useful starting point terms sharpening
 internal focus. tended gravitate toward measure seemed make sense us
 internally clearer idea minds would constitute price stability
 measure, forgetting time frames might whether would get
 systematically opportunistically, would good starting point discussion one
 meetings.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. also prefer staying provisional ranges getting
 left leg Brian's tree talked about. sitting table year working
 short-term options meeting meeting, guess gravitated toward wishing
 better sense crisper view collective long-term strategy. So, glad hear
 kind discussion.
 One comment external constituencies: don't know rest
 you, running complacency among business groups, including
 directors, regard inflation. think success left people feeling
 war inflation. debate last months reconstruction
 CPI undermined arguments anti-inflationary policy even more. People sure
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 know, even know, respect inflation, though
 feeling probably better earlier. attitude certainly makes harder
 sell notion pushing inflation still lower 1/2 1 percentage point. So, would argue
 ongoing job whatever can--and whatever can, Mr. Chairman-to sharpen external understanding focus inflation. awful lot
 complacency, least groups talk to.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. fact, going note explicitly remarks
 make later, find complacency nervous-making particular reflection
 sharp narrowing junk bond yield spreads Treasuries, level equity premiums
 stock market, various relationships one infer financial structure.
 That's because, unlike anecdotal information, often difficult replicate time,
 series going back 1920s, seen patterns move
 down. Human nature constant throughout, one begins suspect
 run period new Nirvana. even old Nirvana,
 change. trouble unfortunately change occurs, often occurs
 abruptly something terribly concerned about. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree proposal retain
 alternative I. think, terms full Humphrey-Hawkins disclosure, expand
 discussion Humphrey-Hawkins report indicate think M2 M3 growth
 may well near upper ends 1997 growth ranges confident
 return normal relationship GDP money growth. So, think
 keep discussion open.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. considered that.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. thing wanted mention also, like you, find
 discussions District developments meetings useful, though others may feel
 rehash Beigebook. think could relate see
 individual corners world inflation various measures inflation either separate
 discussion part initial economic go-around. would like see broader
 discussion various measures inflation think progressing.
 lot changes--going chain weights, example. addition,
 arguments considered reliability CPI measured. lot
 shifting occurring various measures inflation, think would useful
 us get back fundamental discussion that. commodity prices, understand
 world depend corn prices, people quite important.
 think analysis basic relationships feed initial
 commodity prices, gold matter, final prices would useful. sum, would
 good us get back basics.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.
 MR. MCTEER. also favor change ranges reasons gave,
 Mr. Chairman. certainly want give M's much external play give
 impression targeting them. hand, think
 watching internally believe lately, also believe
 make occasional references publicly along things
 die public mind. helps greatly rhetoric tightening becomes
 necessary able say tighten monetary aggregates
 growing inflationary rate. sounds lot better saying tighten
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 economy growing employment growing unemployment
 low. So, money useful thing tool kit, ought keep
 public--we "use lose it."
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. soon start use context,
 M2 starts grow far slower rate, though may think means anything, put
 play devil come back collect dues.
 MR. MCTEER. think difference, though, hanging hat
 merely keeping alive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think ought keep alive, agree
 idea. indeed gain confidence M2, willing allow monetary policy
 reflect evaluations happening money. could conceivably tighten M2
 growth perceived excessive ease looking be-MR. MCTEER. doubt end tightening today,
 so, think one main reasons would M2 growth upper end range
 right now. view good reason reasons could list.
 would feel comfortable would basis wage-cost push
 inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. tell reason labor markets
 getting tight wage increases accelerating, large section
 population would say, "Isn't wonderful!" Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, certainly support alternative I. reasons
 well discussed don't anything add.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 may redundant would like add following: seems
 entering new era appropriate intellectual focus concerns here. think
 first airing morning recall. last decade so,
 process trying work inflation orderly manner, entire focus.
 appropriate ways that? certainly yet fully achieved price
 stability, think beginning enter zone focus shift
 little, start think terms maintain zone time
 begin get it. would like see staff work see us begin
 dialogue questions price indices targeting combination
 indices. someone asked, appropriate levels indices given
 methodologies involved construction? levels indices feel
 comfortable achieving want achieve? zero would
 comfortable, would imply deflationary tendencies
 sectors eonomy. feel impact might
 economy? deal upward drift inflation? accommodate
 hit head instantly already zone price level stability,
 however defined? kinds questions think faced before,
 maybe little ahead curve think right now, would like suggest
 start work area.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. good idea.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MS. MINEHAN. wait long enough talk meetings, others
 already said everything planned say. think Mike Kelley hit exactly right
 formulation here. may closer know maintenance situation
 set difficulties. difficulties differ perhaps Committee faced earlier,
 particularly 1980s, efforts rein inflation. especially true
 difficulties political side referred one way another, Mr. Chairman,
 many comments. I, too, would much favor fuller discussion
 measuring talking discuss inflation. know
 want inflation go up, sure know rate inflation
 currently--or least know know exactly is. translate
 useful concept inflation part economic decision-making
 something specific watch time anticipate time? Maybe
 discussions outside meeting, before. event, believe need
 something along lines Mike Kelley discussed.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. guess little step way issue defined
 discussion first choice would announce target ranges
 explain not. Concurrent Resolution 133 Humphrey-Hawkins adopted
 environment where, even economics profession, consensus
 objectives. So, purpose constrain central bank's activities reduce one source
 uncertainty. continue announce target range aggregate, think, actually hinders
 use formulation policy. would mistake resurrect money objective
 give sense money measure something triggers change funds rate.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 think Herb Stein said, "It certainly true stable relation
 money price level; stable definition money." get back
 situation people thought actions triggered M2
 money measure, would Goodhart's law problem Henry Wallich called
 Heisenberg principle people focusing instrument drawing conclusions
 actions. alters people's behavior therefore changes relationship
 instrument economic activity.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Heisenberg would approved
 application principle!
 MR. JORDAN. think time, whether Humphrey-Hawkins
 testimony couple weeks not, start try get money there. legislation
 require announce particular money measure--M1, M2, anything else.
 says something broadly monetary aggregates. think could try explain using
 something like money growth formulate policy achieve objective price stability
 one thing; setting publicly target annual even multiyear basis, think,
 would mistake. know hard would explain members Congress,
 could tell going announce target ranges anymore
 miscommunicate policy intentions.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. always case new
 legislation replace Humphrey-Hawkins, think would necessarily pushing
 target ranges. would think something else would relevant would
 doing. President Moskow.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, agree alternative I. change
 ranges, think would interpreted change policy really making
 change policy. matter sophisticated explanation, believe would still
 interpreted change policy.
 topics mentioned here, think
 couple topics would useful us discuss. One, idea different measures
 inflation different targets inflation using measures, would find useful.
 mentioned yesterday, concerned CPI core CPI severely criticized
 measures. know biases measures addition BLS
 process making technical adjustments them. obfuscates real target is.
 think looking number different inflation measures would useful
 Committee, developing internal targets would helpful well. least
 would know within Committee direction wanted move Committee.
 second issue believe would useful us discuss get
 price stability. talked past opportunistic approaches types
 approaches. type discussion helpful don't think us
 satisfied staying current level inflation. want lower inflation, clear
 going accomplish that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. seems close to, full, unanimity
 alternative I. consequence that, would differentiate M2, M3, debt
 aggregates, would assume ranges need stay are. So, think
 simplest procedure would reading directive would encompass that.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. BERNARD. wording page 21 Bluebook: "The Federal Open
 Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Don?
 MR. PARRY. Don, paraphrase one first sentences briefing,
 would say present stance policy easy contain inflation.
 background, would like explain opportunism calls point.
 [Laughter] seems assertion true given way opportunism
 explained earlier, conditions see inflation likely rise, would take
 action. little confused. modified definition opportunism?
 MR. KOHN. No, not. think question becomes one much
 confidence Committee Committee member involved projection
 inflation pick up. forecast range uncertainty around it. true
 opportunistic strategy, would inclination lean hard
 tendencies inflation pick less hard shortfalls. So, think
 modified definition. opportunistic Committee member became convinced
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 degree confidence that, fact, policy easy, member would need vote
 change within somewhat arbitrary definition opportunism means.
 MR. PARRY. So, pursuing current policy would require opportunist
 say buy forecast?
 MR. KOHN. think would mean would sufficient uncertainty
 forecast sense desirable wait get information, particularly
 given factors talked holding overall inflation
 probably inflation expectations year. would weigh costs benefits
 waiting obtain information, given degree confidence forecast.
 MR. PARRY. certainly danger that.
 MR. KOHN. cost waiting would event upcreep

 MR. PARRY. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Don, one issue inflation indexed bonds,
 preliminary conclusions could draw premature so?
 MR. KOHN. think premature. general matter, bonds were,

 2/4-5/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. anything else? Let get started beginning
 bottom line working backwards. uppermost concern emergence
 gradual, drip-by-drip inflation pressures. Governor Kelley said day,
 entry point say conclusively tightening, yet may find
 end day inflation dragon nibbled us death.
 One reasons raised irrational expectations issue earlier response
 Jack Guynn's discussions colleagues constituents sense tranquility
 there, history tells us looked good deal trepidation. think
 reason move today think, get minute, inflation
 pressures quite contained moment. think getting point--March may
 appropriate time--when move unless clear evidence emerges
 expansion easing significantly. don't mean evidence GDP growth moderating 1-3/4
 percent whatever forecast is. GDP nice number
 relationship real world. I'm terribly certain is, though everyone tells
 does.
 types things would looking indications orders flattening,
 capacity pressures clearly easing, least sporadic reports around table
 labor market tightness, crucial issue related everything talking about,
 beginning show signs letting up. seen indications yet,
 don't, would think Humphrey-Hawkins report would underscore
 intention hold line inflation take preemptive action needed, Al
 Broaddus talking about, would prime markets anticipate might
 moving quite soon even absence clear evidence upward movements wage
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 price inflation. would take action largely insurance premium,
 raised contexts. warning would constructed, yet know.
 remember latter months 1993 especially January 1994, felt though
 getting table, jumping screaming, "Hey, raise
 rates." three times, said, "Hey, hey." [Laughter] finally raised rates
 25 basis points February 4th markets asked, do, come
 from? don't know whether condition markets wish conditioned
 changes policy, think obligation indicate advance move
 moving. old notion explain three weeks fact
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony strikes wholly inconsistent long takes
 world turn. far better say advance going
 way around.
 looked data, must say general consensus around table
 seems reflect bit concern imminent acceleration inflationary pressures
 think data telling us. doubt wage drift up. question
 much relative historical relationships indicated been. think
 acutely aware tracking either ECI would call adjusted average
 hourly earnings, attempt adjust industry employment shifts overtime, shows
 updrift one squares usual wage/price Phillips curves, example. Indeed,
 assume ECI wage/price Phillips curve exactly target, meaning
 actual calculated wage inflation rates equal, let NAIRU fall
 residual unknown, solving NAIRU gives us number well 5 percent.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 Now, don't consider especially relevant piece information because,
 saying last year half, think special event unique
 particular business cycle governing observing, namely, wage-change/jobinsecurity tradeoff factor. essentially stipulates rise wages less
 historically expected markedly increased concern job layoffs
 smaller-than-expected wage gains convert higher profit margins. turn make
 difficult firm raise prices profits adequate lower prices,
 thereby prompting competitors undercut higher prices increase market share.
 So, think argument job insecurity affects wages turn prices,
 process keeping inflation down. evidence stage, conclusively affirming
 model, least contradict it. Indeed, surveys one organization asked
 employees large corporations afraid laid off. 1991, bottom
 business cycle, 25 percent surveyed organization said were. 1995,
 46 percent despite sharp intervening decline unemployment rate. might say
 recent data 1996 show unchanged 46 percent. also observe that,
 contrary historical relationships, number people voluntarily leave jobs, become
 unemployed, seek new employment--a proxy measure quit rate--has remained steady,
 terribly far number years ago, despite fact risen
 significantly past relationships unemployment rate prevailed.
 regard structure costs prices, grant data terribly
 useful certain respects, want point indicated BEA's figures
 unit costs profits nonfinancial corporations, rough estimates
 fourth quarter filled in. prices BEA uses deflate gross corporate product
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 somewhat arbitrary, evaluation based sophisticated price deflators
 fundamentally change result. event, result last half 1996
 estimated implicit price deflator gross domestic product nonfinancial corporate
 sector unchanged, meaning price change zero. estimated change unit labor costs
 two-quarter period zero. course, unit nonlabor costs plus profits,
 incidentally take approximately one-third total sector income, also zero.
 numbers clearly range error inconsiderable. also remember
 cost evaluation income side, product side. So, productivity gains
 implicit data larger ones getting official data. one thing
 know official data productivity wrong. weaknesses
 associated using income side national income accounts data, segregating
 nonfinancial corporations unincorporated business financial corporations gives us far
 better insight underlying wage/price structure. involved nonlabor
 unit costs plus profits little changed while, since account third
 total costs, would require significant movement unit labor costs get prices moving.
 said that, seriously believe pattern hold much
 longer. think getting point credible believe worker
 motivations labor negotiations leading continued shift wage gains job security
 labor contracts. need remember requirement get old inflationaccelerating process resume wage-change/job-security effect return
 was. required rate decline relative wage gains slow,
 slow point. said year ago and, repeat Larry Meyer said different
 form, saying again. fact happened merely indication
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 powerful force containing inflation. Therefore, felt,
 moment feel, particular urgency moving. seems questionable
 allow last 20 percent process, whatever percentage is, play
 without taking form preemptive action sooner rather later. don't know
 would put terms did, Bill, raised possibility credibility
 wasting asset. something nature there.
 Another aspect current environment financial markets look
 benign. care equity price model one uses; simple model says
 single discount rate indefinite period constant growth rate implied current
 level stock prices. algebraic necessity dividend-price ratio
 earnings-price ratio exactly equal riskless rate interest plus nominal equity
 premium stock yields riskless rates minus growth rate either earnings dividends
 factor payout ratio earnings approach used. know earnings-price
 ratio riskless interest rate, therefore know difference nominal
 equity premium rate growth. Incidentally, may defined either real
 nominal terms; doesn't matter inflation level cancels relationship.
 looking rate earnings growth significantly implicit
 nominal GDP forecasts. Indeed, yesterday's Chart Show Mike Prell chart
 I/B/E/S three- five-year earnings forecast rising sharply, rate growth
 something like 12-3/4 percent per annum five-year horizon. Since cannot infer
 significant drift S&P 500 earnings NIPA economic earnings,
 implicit expectation continued rise profit margins. inconceivable? No. Could
 happen? could. probable? would want bet ranch. earnings estimate
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 high, sufficiently high equity premium, puts number somewhere
 range recent history particularly line. If, however, lower earnings
 estimate, also bring earnings premium falls significantly
 credible recent history, including 1987. means market overvalued
 regard. grant Abby Cohen little relationship, wish well. hope spends
 bonus, gather substantial year, prudently.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. certainly assume
 substantial.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. allowed invest market,
 allow around here, don't think would forcefully! type
 thing plus various risk spreads, really quite narrow way
 quite while, suggest product prices alone sole criterion
 going maintain stable, viable financial system whose fundamental goal, let us remember,
 attainment maximum sustainable economic growth. real economy matters.
 Finance interesting financial prices quite important
 affect real economy. Ultimately, charter about.
 start thinking form preemptive move
 communicate credible manner. would inclined anything today. Indeed,
 tighten policy now, think would really shock market way would
 quite destabilizing would advance goals. don't think particular urgency
 here. don't think getting evidence underlying price structure
 commodity side pressure pushing through. clear wage growth,
 whatever is, significantly exceeding productivity increases real world.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 consequence, evidence rise unit labor costs rates suggest eating
 profit margins confirmed data aware. Indeed, earnings
 forecasts 1997 Wall Street analysts show increases consistent rising profit
 margins, falling profit margins.
 short, see credible evidence increasing price pressures. even
 though listened anecdotal reports price pressures around table yesterday,
 talking parts regional economies. would suspect real data
 full-blown evaluation unit costs, paradigm shift Cathy Minehan mentioned, moving
 preventing rising supplier prices actually nudging down, would turn far
 prevalent believe people realize. So, think policy implementation take
 account complex set considerations. think ought reflect best
 Humphrey-Hawkins report prepared move next meeting.
 saying necessarily should. saying careful
 inflation dragon's nibbling capabilities, mentioned before, really
 concerns all. make issue Humphrey-Hawkins hearing
 economy eases enough move dictated, don't think would particularly much
 damage monetary policy. turns get surprised quick acceleration
 inflation, means somewhat behind curve, least monetary
 policy choice unambiguous. likely outcome middle dragon
 lurking there, makes nervous. consequence, would argue staying
 "B" today asymmetry unlike previous couple meetings.
 reason change it, real asymmetry see time. Vice Chairman.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, fully endorse
 recommendation made, try fill gap others prepare pop
 quiz evaluation equity market. also think asymmetry really quite different
 read meaning tighten soon probably March meeting.
 believe would wish later incoming information suggested greater
 weakness likely have, payback first quarter
 strong fourth quarter. think would convince slowdown
 meaningful one reflects payback.
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, think important prepare
 way explain world, market public generally, likely
 coming. think market participants likely get message time, largely
 get last time. tend learn kind experience.
 think remote possibility getting it, might decide
 make message little clearer. Since make art form saying things
 move markets, perhaps could use regard enhancing said even
 quoting help bring attention it.
 Going message Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, think hit
 themes rather strongly, suggested them: Another theme goal
 price stability achieve sustained economic growth. high
 capacity usage economy experiencing, potential noninflationary growth really limited,
 know, sum growth labor force growth productivity.
 could remind monetary policy environment hurt sustained economic growth
 stays accommodative long simply capability produce
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 higher real growth overly accommodative policy. sort approach would give
 opportunity remind people Federal Reserve much pro-growth
 pro-employment want higher growth rate way achieved
 debauching currency increasing saving rate therefore improving economy's
 ability increase investment.
 Especially since would moving preemptively again, believe much
 should, careful Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. would hope
 whatever rest us saying next meeting fall
 anti-growth trap. One particular tool think useful us analytically one
 feeds we-are-against-growth image, highly suspected case, use
 NAIRU. New York Fed, may remember, extraordinarily accurate
 1994 forecasting real economy extraordinarily inaccurate predicting inflation,
 overestimated. need humility great teacher, pushed us hard
 direction trying figure made mistake. One things
 become rather convinced NAIRU interesting analytical tool,
 poor forecasting tool. talk going tell us
 next month, however eloquently express ourselves, think come across anti
 growth. see unwise leads American people believe think
 help fact harmful them. help public policy debate
 help posture Federal Reserve.
 sorry bit long-winded, think "B" asymmetric, seriously
 asymmetric, right choice ought girding loins probable tightening
 next meeting.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, understand argument. confess,
 though, concerns waiting. market aware experienced
 strong economic growth last year seeing effects growth
 terms capacity use forth. go road, think public
 able distinguish growth rate slowing 2 percent nothing versus
 slowing 3 percent plus 2 percent bit less. So, move now, think
 people even convinced take action circumstances slowing
 growth. may therefore find paralyzed next meeting, could
 cause us problems difficult deal with.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would comment last thing want
 look last quarter's growth.
 MR. HOENIG. understand.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. words, cater point view would
 unwise.
 MR. HOENIG. think perception exists. event, see least
 reasonable consensus higher inflation prospect, act on.
 move sort consensus, think find
 difficult position terms taking action road.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. purpose Humphrey-Hawkins testimony
 address exactly subject.
 MR. HOENIG. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, recent surge economic activity raised
 level output, already appeared long-run potential. intensified
 concerns outlook rising inflationary pressures, think provided
 stronger case tightening policy. Moreover, two monetary policy rules consult
 Bank--one estimated version Taylor's rule second nominal income growth
 rate rule--both suggest need increase funds rate quarter. Even accept
 3 percent target core CPI, think high, rules suggest funds rate
 raised 25 basis points bit quarter. course, inflation target 2
 percent, think appropriate, would involve stronger action. view, time
 take initial modest step tightening policy, therefore would prefer 25 basis point
 increase funds rate 5-1/2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer.
 MR. MEYER. staff projects decline unemployment rate 5 percent,
 1/2 percentage point estimate NAIRU, result see
 progressive deterioration inflation outlook. Now, sure forecast,
 think would agree tighten immediately even though sharpest increases inflation
 surface 1998.
 want respond Bob Parry's question, "we" include opportunists
 prefer deliberate approach reducing inflation? use "we"
 encompassing one case. move now? Uncertainty forecast,
 structure economy specifically value NAIRU, justifies, think,
 cautious approach. Fortunately, usual inertia inflation process prospect
 decline energy prices combine yield still favorable inflation outlook 1997,
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 reducing need immediate action. risk above-trend growth risk
 current unemployment rate already NAIRU together strongly support asymmetric
 policy directive complement unchanged policy.
 interesting discussion Kohn Chairman
 question, now, when. think really talking here. One
 perspective that, indeed, time come issue prepare markets.
 widespread expectation policy change meeting,
 tightening move would great surprise. issue. think think
 whether point whether something need trigger action.
 Let give perspective relates back staff forecast. would
 respond staff forecast turned correct? would argue see decline
 unemployment rate, specifically 5 percent rate staff forecast, would
 reason tighten independently whatever happening inflation pressures directly.
 is, decline unemployment rate would appropriate trigger increase
 funds rate. general view utilization rates increase short-term rates
 increase. build procyclicality interest rates would occur normally,
 example, money growth rule stable money demand function Taylor
 rule. meantime inflation pressures build, still aggressive action would
 required. would example clear trigger. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, morning's decision really tough one
 frankly comments Bob Parry Tom Hoenig made tougher. number
 comments made given comfort, though, accept recommendation
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 morning. let say emphatically unless see marked change
 outlook balance risks soon, frankly expect, think going
 need move tighter policy posture. believe almost certainly
 March meeting, think circumstances might propel us move even sooner
 that. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Timing everything, guess. past year thought
 somewhat tighter monetary policy would appropriate. would reversed insurance
 policy, final one took beginning last year. year progressed,
 looking third-quarter data, began believe tightening could postponed
 seeming slowness expansion gave us breathing room. feel misled
 somewhat unevenness economic progress last year. look back year, see
 economy clearly expanding pace beyond long-term trend operating
 constrained labor resources financing environment obviously conducive excess.
 you, Mr. Chairman, presented us couple options, particularly
 Don's wait-and-see option another would characterize see-and-do. worried

 see restraining factors going pull in, like President Hoenig bit
 worried variability numbers keep getting. forcing us

 believe sense possible move; forecasts suggest people expect

 moderate proactivity. So, would align President Parry's suggestion 25
 basis point increase funds rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. completely support proposal;
 believe right one. also think suggestions may need move near
 future probably correct, would support likely probability.
 little uncomfortable may excessive amount prejudging policy action.
 bit haunted fact saw emerging pressures clearly going lead
 outbreak inflation year 18 months ago, are. think
 forget that. outbreak still ahead us. pressures still there. may
 intense, rise inflation may start tomorrow morning; may already started
 cannot see yet. think little cautious prejudging going

 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. delighted last year's results even though
 forecast anybody. [Laughter] hope similar mistakes year sense
 growth, lower unemployment, less inflation projecting. also
 recognize accurate anticipating way 1996 going come
 year ago, spite favorable inflation outlook would notched
 funds rate early last year. would supported reducing funds rate
 able anticipate accurately way year came out. Given that, logic tells
 would better hindsight recalibrated, probably
 would happier today funds rate 5-1/2 percent. Certainly, 5-1/2
 percent, would reducing it.
 concerned, Mr. Chairman, going able
 communicate markets, people political circles, public large.
 Labor Department tells us still 6 million people working. Fortunately,
 live District, would like see lot people find jobs.
 metropolitan areas District unemployment rates around 4 percent lower,
 case couple years. would delighted saw
 metropolitan areas Bob Parry's District 4 percent unemployment. So, would
 endorse fully Bill McDonough said--care needs taken avoid communicating
 concerned many people working, unemployment 6 million
 few, would happy 4 million unemployed. think
 very, important communications issue try prepare markets everybody
 else seems unavoidable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 MR. BOEHNE. buy basic approach. think odds
 tighten. absolutely foregone conclusion. open-mindedness appropriate,
 think general framework right. communications issue, us around
 table fair amount training economics use economists' shorthand.
 shorthand meaning among among academic peers. must say
 shorthand gets used public us much good. ought never
 get position saying tightening much growth
 unemployment rate low. Whenever tighten, ought explained
 framework pro-sustainable growth pro-job growth. NAIRU concept, means
 lot economists, unfortunate way communicating 99.99 percent
 people understand comes across meaning growth
 jobs. economists understand NAIRU concept usefulness,
 really recast whole approach terms communicating pro-growth,
 done. case much salable put price stability context.
 would urge Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, would urge us
 aftermath that, move strongly direction public comments think
 effective way educate public understanding
 value price stability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, believe Greenbook forecast, see
 core inflation accelerate 2.6 percent last year 2.8 percent year 3.2 percent next
 year. add adjustment technical changes, number 1998 accelerates 3.6
 percent, believe would find unacceptable. really comes question,
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 number people said, whether confidence forecast. believe
 forecast, tightening now, given lags monetary policy. However, labor costs
 prices accelerated would expected basis past experience. So,
 think understandable questions inflation forecast
 Greenbook. Given uncertainty, personally believe prudent thing wait
 longer point see early signs emerge inflation closer accelerating.
 time believe prepared act immediately. concerned inflation
 dragon, artfully described it, nibbling away us. involves insidious buildup
 inflation .1 percent .2 percent year. course, seen buildup yet
 core price measures, something concerned higher
 inflation gets built structure may difficult get structure.
 point, clearly support "B" asymmetric.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin.
 MS. RIVLIN. also support recommendation "B" asymmetric. would
 include strong expression Humphrey-Hawkins testimony concern
 sustainability low inflation tight labor markets. believe best informed group
 American economy one could possibly assemble anywhere, benefit
 best statistical analysis real feel economy around country. yet
 come back end gut feeling happening. feeling changed since
 last meeting. pointed evidence higher inflation solidly based
 statistics, question whether sure worry
 sustainability growth consistency price stability. cannot sure, think
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 everybody around table would agree prudent thing something
 today would move, yet reasons waiting little longer.
 respect Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, think lot important
 things said around table couch communicate
 importance sustainable growth. worried wasting credibility asset. think

 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, may get correction equity markets bond

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. agree recommendation. Let take moment
 elaborate. view, circumstances changed significantly recent months,
 continue think reasonably high probability going want adopt
 restrictive policy course 1997. ask now, think
 reason use garner amount support acting juncture.
 ask question: consequences soon-to-become-famous
 inflation dragon start nibble little sooner expect find behind
 curve? seems implications either would move little
 end day otherwise would maybe would move
 amount concentrated period time otherwise. costs seem
 great. So, comfortable recommendation.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. favor alternative C least something
 direction, reasons remain stating: think inflation high,
 see increasing evidence inflationary pressures building, especially labor markets.
 Finally, think one say stance policy restrictive right now;
 believe action called for. clearly going anything meeting,
 anticipate possible move future, might want think one taken
 would leave people position uncertain direction next
 move would be. words, much different position last time
 circumstances, starting 3 percent funds rate long way go.
 probably far away ought be, think
 enough one shot uncertainty direction next move. might
 argue modest move opening salvo, one simply would encourage people
 speculate next move. got enough tightening done last time,
 beneficial impact long-term markets. fact, raised funds rate by, recall, 50 basis
 points one point actually got drop long rates. would nice able get
 sooner rather later move.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. support "B" asymmetric. seems
 situation fairly similar last summer. guess need tighten
 year. impression employers run room terms ability
 pass price increases. So, think inflation dragon getting closer. believe
 time assess whether fourth-quarter strength necessarily result strained
 
 2/4-5/97
 
 resource utilization. take advantage Humphrey-Hawkins report prepare
 markets also explain goal price stability.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, comfortable way
