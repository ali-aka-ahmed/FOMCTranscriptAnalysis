 MS. RIVLIN. Peter, think learned April surprises
 affecting federal funds rate, think need learn next April?
 MR. FISHER. need go back drawing board forecasting

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. sufficient regional data help us

 MR. FISHER. No, not. rather disappointing inability take

 MR. PRELL. aware anyone tried that; interesting idea.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Big Blue could it. [Laughter]
 MR. PRELL. sure much free computer space right

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Mike?
 MR. JORDAN. Mike, story tell past concerns
 future consistent supply side surprise--a productivity shock. passive sense,
 happens accommodate existing demand peg nominal
 interest rate natural rate--the real rate--is shifting period. see
 acceleration nominal spending growth money credit growth go along
 
 5/20/97
 make possible. dynamics, then, cause process
 reverse growth nominal spending slow? referring baseline forecast
 concern upside. true that, effect, natural rate shifts back
 get slowing staff projecting money bank credit
 growth? get refer fairly attractive scenario.
 MR. PRELL. talking natural rate interest, presume.
 MR. JORDAN. Right.
 MR. PRELL. guess one could interpret said stocks
 capital goods implying lower natural rate going forward. One could look
 various vantage points. Whether, indeed, one view development
 surprisingly strong growth past year favorable supply shock, sure.
 certainly elements picture support view. labor force
 growth past year might fall category. one felt
 seeing something normal kind cyclical kick productivity
 past couple quarters output growth surged, say strengthened aggregate demand,
 might characterized supply shock. sure conclusion clearcut.
 Indeed, normal rules thumb model results, think
 productivity acceleration past couple quarters one would expected
 surge aggregate demand, rise output, firms able get mileage
 existing resources.
 MR. KOHN. President Jordan, thinking real rate relative
 equilibrium natural level, don't believe real rate bit equilibrium level,
 apparently been, would inconsistent staff forecast. fact, perfectly
 
 5/20/97
 consistent economy producing level beyond potential sustained basis
 inflation creeping circumstances. would necessarily case
 real rate bit equilibrium rate, gap economy
 potential would widen. So, think staff forecast requires
 equilibrium rate drop back again. fact, staff forecast consistent
 equilibrium rate bit real rates right now.
 MR. JORDAN. clear that. understand framework
 different, growth nominal demand accelerates rate 8 percent,
 first quarter, dynamics cut growth half unless say surge
 statistical error unwind itself? dynamics adjustment
 process include accommodation behavior increase nominal demand,
 causes second difference turn negative?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. answer that? think two factors
 that, taken together, consistent framework. One involves inventories.
 buildup inventories incapable sustained rate,
 change actual interest rate versus natural rate growth process
 turn down. adjustment process affected
 differential actual natural rate. Secondly, serious question
 seasonal adjustments. growth nominal demand significantly higher,
 seasonally adjusted, first quarter weather warmer usual,
 growth unusually low second quarter, would looking explanation
 real world. suspect combination factors enough explain
 
 5/20/97
 full shift nominal GDP. know fact, certainly going
 right direction.
 MR. JORDAN. confirming evidence that, would expect see slower
 money bank credit growth emerge period. least staff projection, take it,
 going get that. surge never real reflected bad
 seasonals inventory buildup go away. sure interpretation right,
 would need sense accommodate much slower growth money credit;
 otherwise missed it.
 MR. PRELL. Barring shift demand money--this almost
 tautological--we would expect see slower money growth moderation nominal
 GDP expansion anticipating. forecast sense says that,
 intermediate-term basis rather looking quarter-to-quarter defining movements
 natural rates interest sense, actual rate low relative natural
 rate bring us back equilibrium actual potential output. terms,
 ongoing gap natural unemployment rate actual unemployment

 MR. KOHN. judgment, President Jordan, seeing slowing
 money growth recent months abstract accumulation balances
 payment taxes. looking kind thing taking account fact
 essentially no-growth forecast M2 May, think rate growth
 aggregate fact decelerated couple percentage points first
 second quarter.
 
 5/20/97
 MR. JORDAN. know, use MZM monitor things happen

 right nominal GDP. second half year, would expect MZM
 get 3 4 percent growth rate forecast right.
 MR. PRELL. pointed previously, money demand relationship,

 years. big movement interest rates, would expect close
 equal growth M2 nominal GDP.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, questions Mike? not,

 Industrial production flat April. Payroll employment growth slowed
 March April. Retail sales declined slightly April flat March. Producer
 prices declined 4 consecutive months, .6 percent April. CPI increases also
 moderated energy prices reversed last year's buildup. Greenbook real
 GDP rising 1.8 percent rate second quarter next 6 quarters
 projects growth rates 2.5, 2.3, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9 1.9 percent. understand it,
 projections assume fed funds target rate increase mid-1998. Even strong real
 growth something fear, numbers would hardly seem frightening. Actual
 measured inflation also declined recent months. Greenbook first-quarter
 
 5/20/97
 CPI rate 2.3 percent; CPI forecast second quarter 1.2-percent; rises 3
 percent second half 1998. So, Greenbook forecasting rather slow real growth
 well rather low CPI inflation. remember past Greenbooks well
 Jerry Jordan, recall recent times Greenbook underestimated real growth

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry Republic California.
 [Laughter]
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, strong economic growth continued
 Twelfth Federal Reserve District recent months, although pace slowed slightly
 fastest growing states. first quarter 1997, District jobs expanded
 3-1/2 percent annual rate. fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Utah,
 Oregon--growth averaging 3-1/2 7 percent. exception Alaska
 Hawaii, employment growth District states running 3 percent.
 Construction services continue fastest growing sectors District economy,
 manufacturing becoming key contributor growth District employment.
 Manufacturing employment grew 3 percent annual rate first quarter,
 rapid expansion high-tech aircraft production boosted growth food
 processing textile industries.
 Accompanying strong employment growth recent surge District's
 labor force. states, labor force growth broad-based. California, however,
 estimates perhaps one-half new labor market entrants transitioned
 welfare work competing narrow range low-skilled jobs. total
 number U.S. welfare recipients must leave rolls July year, 38
 percent California. individuals move labor force, labor force
 participation California increase 1/2 percentage point.
 Despite rapid labor force growth, strong employment demand creating tight
 labor market conditions several parts District. District-wide unemployment rate
 fallen 1/2 percentage point past quarter, several areas District
 
 5/20/97
 competition employees fierce employers holding job fairs offering
 finder's fees signing bonuses recruit new hires.
 Turning national economy, risk inflationary pressures building
 seems increased since March meeting. economy's rapid growth
 recent quarters means operating noticeably higher level according
 unemployment rate estimated GDP gap. unemployment rate clearly
 inflation danger zone even take account rather large standard errors
 characterize estimates NAIRU, excess real GDP potential level rose
 1-3/4 percent first quarter according estimate. addition,
 industrial capacity utilization rate somewhat level inflation typically
 accelerated past.
 indicators presenting fairly uniform picture excessive pressure
 resources, believe good reason worried trend inflation
 future. Given situation, key question whether real GDP likely slow enough
 long enough period time eliminate inflationary pressures. Like
 Greenbook, forecast current quarter shows rather sharp slowing growth;
 estimate 2 percent current quarter. certainly would surprising see
 pause activity following torrid pace first quarter. Looking second half
 year, expect growth come around trend rate 2 percent. would still
 leave unemployment rate 5 percent end 1997.
 bottom line unlikely basic problem pressure
 resources would solved anytime soon unchanged funds rate. best judgment
 point underlying inflation would show modest upward trend year next
 
 5/20/97
 monetary policy remained unchanged. course, look CPI, good deal
 upward trend would obscured higher dollar lower price oil,
 mention methodological changes introduced BLS. always, course,
 acknowledge forecast rising underlying inflation could turn
 wrong number reasons. example, difficult judge magnitude
 possible roles enhanced productivity changes labor market holding
 inflation. However, believe even slowdown growth current quarter,
 risk rising inflation future increased serious level.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. First, want comment speech NYU
 couple weeks ago. thought effective also welcome even
 though wire service types still know difference nominal real

 concerned that, people political left political right criticizing us,
 could together foster general environment open season central bank. Criticism
 either side constitute great risk us, sort unholy alliance

 desirable, hope get chance testify Hill July,
 able press arguments maybe get people start listening.
 Probably like others around table, spent long interval meetings
 traveling around District lot meetings, sometimes small communities. One

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, start comment way
 started comments last several meetings: Economic activity Fifth District
 still strong. survey readings manufacturing services sectors slip
 little April, remained close high levels jumped
 March. indicated rate expansion region seen since first
 half 1994. Moreover, directors contacts suggest little, any, softening
 demand. Labor markets remain tight. demand lower skilled labor continues
 increase substantial rate. Despite reports rising wages recently parts
 District, fewer reports price pass-throughs last several weeks
 getting little earlier year reported earlier.
 striking new development District something fits
 Mike Prell said commercial real estate. real estate markets, especially
 northern Virginia, told rental rates industrial office space gotten
 back peaks reached 1989. Also first time expansion,
 getting increasing reports speculative building, especially office buildings northern
 Virginia.
 Turning national picture, Greenbook projects real GDP growth
 slow accord coming months. Certainly given extraordinary growth
 seen last couple quarters, slowing seems likely. see it, nothing
 fundamentals really assures us rate expansion going slow trend.
 obviously needs happen going avoid boom. think point
 Jerry Jordan making question earlier. contrary, staff candidly
 
 5/20/97
 recognizes write-up household fundamentals general economic fundamentals
 remain exceptionally strong. continue see significant upside risk outlook.
 projected deceleration reflects considerable part reduced inventory building
 big run-up last quarter, Mike Prell emphasized. regard, Greenbook
 authors seem concerned constrained availability supplies generate
 precautionary demand inventories time 1994. conclusion may
 right, is, interesting question why. Maybe firms wanted extra stocks 1994
 sure monetary policy would needed contain
 expansion. Maybe confidence us year, case, think
 would underscore important role credibility needs play generating
 reinforcing sustained moderation economic activity staff projecting. case,
 think stock building needs counted upside risk near-term outlook.
 Another considerable upside risk Greenbook forecast projected
 increase labor force participation rate happen. Greenbook projecting
 real GDP growth rate 3.1 percent 1997, expected take unemployment
 rate 4.8 percent end year, leaving around level 1998.
 rate sustained long, could create capacity problems.
 expected increase labor force participation occur still get
 predicted growth, obviously unemployment rate could driven even lower. Given
 relatively moderate increase productivity staff forecast, think Mike Prell made
 point payroll employment rise 2 percent generate 3 percent growth
 projected year. twice longer-term trend growth labor force.
 Increased participation may bail us out. bailed us last year; maybe
 
 5/20/97
 year, maybe won't. course, alternative possibility productivity
 rise rapidly year 1.2 percent increase staff projecting
 trend rate may moved 2 percent so, number economists others
 arguing.
 Let conclude couple brief remarks alternative
 scenario might imply aggregate demand interest rates. little
 counter-intuitive, think even possibility involves upside risk. Let us suppose
 markets confident Fed conduct policy hold CPI increase rate
 3 percent year inflation expectations anchored 2 percent--that
 issue. Let us assume environment productivity trend increases.
 financial markets specifically real interest rates? Broadly speaking,
 improved productivity trend going cause firms expect higher future earnings
 workers expect higher future wages. point needs emphasized
 situation that, existing level real interest rates, businesses households
 going want bring expected future income present. Workers may
 want fix houses; business firms may want invest new plant equipment;
 try borrowing expected future increases income. But,
 course, economy future income output yet real interest rates
 rise order restrain new demand credit. effect, higher real rates
 raise price current consumption terms future consumption foregone firms
 households content wait economy actually output hand
 try consume it. point story is--and bottom line--that even
 productivity trend turns higher staff assuming, would
 
 5/20/97
 
 remove inflationary risk stemming labor markets, real interest rates
 would still need rise prevent credit-driven increase aggregate demand.
 sum, Mr. Chairman, see considerable upside risk staff forecast,
 think need market little insurance.

 Manufacturers generally expect high level activity balance year

 Labor markets tight many areas District. One sign
 parents, although greatly relieved, pleasantly surprised someone willing hire

 Many businesses, however, still say cannot raise prices therefore must offset
 higher wage costs somewhere else, usually improved efficiencies.
 Turning nation, uncertainties demand side economy

 concerned alert regarding inflation outlook, difficult assess near-term

 Returning moment District developments, like Jerry Jordan done
 quite bit traveling, found particularly interesting meetings labor,

 future? Recent forecasting records good. October 1996,
 many forecasters projected economy would grow annual rate less 2-1/2

 3.8 percent. January year, many forecasters projected economy would
 grow rate less 2-1/2 percent first quarter, forecast turned

 even short observed rate 5.6 percent reported far. current quarter,
 forecasters projecting growth rate 2-1/2 percent less. may right

 essential us maintain longer-term orientation focused general
 level prices, monetary policy ultimately influence. Inflation
 running rate close 3 percent past five years, continued
 rate far 1997. Thus, see little reason believe longer-run inflation trend
 decline. Looking forward, risks remain upside. Broad money credit
 growing rapidly, could easily translate upward pressure demand growth

 longer-term view appropriate action temper inflation risks.
 sending message intention cap inflation 3 percent
 desirable, mistake give markets impression inflation near 3 percent
 consistent long-run price stability goal. recent IMF report world
 economic outlook posed question: inflation outside range country's
 authorities consider consistent price stability? According IMF report,
 answer United States "no." think question good one FOMC
 might benefit discussing it. judgment less percentage point

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. almost two months since
 last meeting, many ways economic situation seems like same:
 strong growth demand production, continued expectations slowdown,
 inflationary pressures generally seem contained. don't see need review
 underlying factors, would like comment seem particularly important

 respect contribution potential strength length current expansion.
 first factor would point one mentioned Gary Stem,
 business fixed investment. area strength generally
 underestimated expansion, although current Greenbook forecast

 adding capacity. investment allowing business firms meet rising
 demand without increase prices, may also generating productivity
 increases. productivity hypothesis supported continued strength profits. agree
 Governor Rivlin really know happening, see
 bottom line, indicates despite increases unit labor costs--and costs
 rising faster rate general price increases--businesses able maintain
 profits without raising prices.
 business fixed investment supported favorable
 financial environment. financial environment supported growth, also
 allowed firms nonfinancial sector strengthen balance sheets. Internal
 financing available. bond market deep liquid provided
 significant debt financing opportunities. would note spreads speculative-grade
 debt particularly low, even higher risk companies access debt
 market favorable rates. Bank credit remained available. Commercial delinquencies
 relatively low, outlook good there. Securitizations commercial credits
 made source credit even reliable. equity side, seen IPO
 issuance decline bit last year, equity via IPOs still available reasonable

 financing culprit business investment falls off.
 U.S. economy, forecast macroeconomy cannot ignore consumer

 expenditures rate matches income growth, so-called Goldilocks outlook.
 hot consumers leveraged finance purchases much debt,
 pent-up demand unlikely factor late stage business cycle.
 hand, cold sense unemployment low, sentiment good,
 wealth effects stock market continue provide strength. So,
 think reason anticipate slump consumer spending.
 federal deficit situation one factors could throw economy
 path yet another soft landing, Governor Rivlin mentioned, outlook
 deficit actually little better. budget deal good news, although
 recognize structural budget problems still addressed.
 certainly lot farther trail several years ago.

 Greenbook end first section, forces might influencing
 trend events going 1999 there. Addressing latter point,
 think policy 1999 forward?
 
 5/20/97
 Let outline briefly two strands thought context national
 economic goal maximum sustainable growth, Fed believe requires price
 level stability prerequisite success. First all, reversed policy last
 meeting. holding fire many quarters face rising labor market
 pressures, seeing strong surge activity first quarter, counter
 expectations, FOMC raised federal funds rate 25 basis points. absolute terms,
 modest move, impact yet fully felt. believe
 carried two meaningful psychological messages. First, new policy paradigm
 sense basic thrust monetary policy toward tightening. second, Fed
 continues intention permitting inflation get grip economy.
 entirely comfortable decision. opinion, clearly right thing do.
 decision behind us, stand today? pace economic
 activity, still moving forward, appears slowing. employment cost index
 moved modestly first quarter. commodity prices flat down. Unit labor
 costs appear accelerating. Profit margins continue strong deterioration
 provide us early warning inflationary change. appears
 fear inflation embedded yield curve. peruse Beigebook, go back
 check date continues read precisely well year.
 best judgment growth continue, seeing likely
 definitive signs incipient inflationary creep. terms stated national
 economic goal, seem pose clear present danger.
 Moving line-of-thought number two: absence settled notion
 definition price level stability, think responsible judgment made
 
 5/20/97
 either zone close it. CPI measurement percentage point
 high, real CPI increasing rate 1 2 percent. Almost
 price indexes indicate steady rate inflation 1 2 percent range, although
 measures, including core CPI, suggest inflation may beginning edge up.
 Chairman's qualitative definition price stability, namely inflation
 concerns removed economic decisionmaking, appears largely place.
 close price stability zone, terms national economic goals,
 relevant question becomes hold economy keep robust.
 First all, higher-than-trend growth continues resumes soon--and well
 may; think growth risks upside--that clearly would seem require additional
 tightening, perhaps good deal it. economy returns trend rate growth
 slower trend, may significant probability, given economy's performance
 characteristics past two years guide, need adjust policy
 time indeed absolute certainty direction may ultimately
 move. Further, satisfactorily understand economy working well
 right now. cut momentum back much soon, might forego
 precious opportunity learn could critically important new
 realities. view, risk/return ratio alternative policies evaluated national
 economic goals provides ample reason waiting see happens events unfold.
 Thank you.

 form higher utilization rates. framework utilization growth risks
 using assess risk higher inflation, data since last meeting simply
 transformed growth risk utilization risk. bad trade perspective
 inflation risk. traded speculative increase utilization rates,
 growth risk is, realized increase labor utilization rates.
 least two sources increased uncertainty suggested flow
 data meetings. uncertainty sometimes encourages caution policy action,
 expect weigh decision today. First, may greater uncertainty
 second-half outlook, given sharpness slowdown appears way
 second quarter given questions degree persistence expected slowing
 inventory investment. is, even though combination stronger-than-expected
 first-quarter growth sharp slowing projected Greenbook second quarter

 Second, better-than-expected performance labor costs first-quarter ECI report
 April reading average hourly earnings might increase uncertainty
 estimate NAIRU hence increase uncertainty degree
 deterioration expected inflation outlook economy returns trend growth
 unemployment rate stabilizes current level.
 believe fundamentals supporting expansion remain positive.
 going focus two examples positive underlying fundamentals: financial
 conditions broadly defined consumer confidence. might ask factors
 contributed strong above-trend growth last year half. supportive set
 
 5/20/97
 financial conditions certainly seems factor. Financial conditions either
 sufficiently stimulative promote strength sufficiently restrictive
 prevent resurgence. Borrowing terms generally viewed attractive home buying,
 consumer durable purchases, business fixed investment. problem,
 excessive amount borrowing households would like undertake
 prevailing financial conditions.
 financial conditions changed since March 25 policy action?
 action widely anticipated, largely reflected financial market conditions
 time move. Since March move, however, long-term interest rates edged
 slightly lower, stock market rallied, dollar first rose declined
 initial level. monetary conditions index United States, took account
 short-term long-term interest rates, stock market, exchange rates would,
 believe, show favorable financial market conditions today case
 immediately following March move.

 supports case want make. preliminary report Michigan Consumer
 Sentiment Index early May extremely interesting. shows decline index
 relates current economic conditions consistent projected near-term
 slowing. also indicates sharp improvement expectations future conditions
 supportive prospect solid second-half rebound. Let read sentences
 Richard Curtin's interpretation early May data consumer sentiment:
 "Extraordinary strength recorded consumer sentiment first half May,
 
 5/20/97
 Sentiment Index reaching new record level. early May gain reflected
 consumer reactions favorable economic news dominated headlines:
 record low unemployment, strong GDP growth, resurgent stock market. Moreover,
 sharp contrast initial reaction interest rate hike, consumers
 concluded recent increase little, any, impact future economic
 conditions. sure, consumers changed views interest rate
 hikes would forthcoming year ahead. Consumers, however, longer expect
 rate increases damp income gains represent barrier planned purchases."
 conclusion projected slowing current quarter part payback,
 part special factors, part breather, likely beginning extended period
 below-trend growth. underlying fundamentals remain positive. result,
 perspective monetary policy, give appropriate attention level

 coming quarters.

 5/20/97
 indeed think appropriate, let sketch believe may well happening, put
 scenario table hypothesis, try see shortcomings may be.
 First, significant unexpected evidence profit margins
 still rising late stage business cycle expansion. preliminary earnings
 reports suggest domestic operating profits nonfinancial corporations showed
 fairly significant rise margins first quarter. add dramatic rise
 foreign affiliate earnings, increased despite rise dollar, find quite
 impressive increase total profits. is, start firms S&P 500, whose
 domestic earnings rising faster smaller firms, add smaller companies,
 allow nonpublic corporations also appear national income accounts

 interesting implication going
 disaggregate data nonfinancial corporations, turns estimated rate
 increase total unit costs first quarter 1996 first quarter 1997 close
 zero. total, combines unit labor unit nonlabor costs, moving lower
 recent years; is, rate increase underlying total unit costs slowing.
 number first quarter 1997, rough estimate point one
 based accounting relationships, best seen while. believe
 price data reasonably accurate, meaning bias changing much,
 believe profits estimates right--the latter based independent
 earnings reports--then, arithmetic, total unit costs could changed much.
 subtract nonlabor unit costs, comprised essentially capital consumption
 allowances net interest per unit combined falling quite while--
 
 5/20/97
 may recall discussed couple meetings ago--the residual, unit labor costs,
 seen increased rate 1 percent past year, rate
 increase, too, falling.
 reasonable set numbers average hourly compensation,
 rising period, permits us derive productivity numbers accelerating
 significantly--up roughly 3 percent first quarter 1996 first quarter 1997.
 Now, one remember productivity estimate cover full economy.

 considerations background, let offer version
 Bluebook policy options consideration. First, alternative B, change.
 alternative could supported basis two quite different arguments. want
 
 5/20/97
 place least much emphasis principles underlie action action
 itself. Let call first rationale action "B/reactive policy" alternative.

 part, puzzles current episode yet pushed camp.
 might worry view suggests irrational exuberance affected
 stock market.
 take liberty redefining alternative C menu options 1/4
 percentage point additional tightening today. would second step cautious
 still preemptive policy posture. justified increase utilization rates since
 last meeting combined expectation, consistent Greenbook forecast,
 utilization rates likely remain level going forward. light
 
 5/20/97
 uncertainties previously discussed, could accompany move
 announcement indicates intent pause March May moves. pause
 would allow us await confirmation rebound demand third quarter, assess

 implications additional information labor costs inflation whether utilization
 rates already high yield rising trend inflation. pause also would
 provide opportunity assess July NIPA revisions insights trend productivity
 growth. Given prevailing large statistical discrepancy recent unexpected surge
 tax receipts, reason particularly interested revision.
 Let offer third alternative compromise, call "B/go slow,"
 hope keeping spirit Chairman's proposal. Like "B/reactive" policy,
 calls change policy today, presumably combined asymmetric directive
 clearly justified inflation risks today's initial conditions. also carries
 expectation current utilization rates may justify additional tightening. postpone

 5/20/97
 reactive posture history suggests ultimately produce overheating higher inflation
 end threatening expansion.
 prefer "C." think disciplined policy, balanced approach,
 could live "B/go slow" contributes stronger FOMC consensus
 current prospective policy.
 Let turn two quite different sets considerations would
 consistent choice reactive strategy. promoting either
 justifications--I already committed preemptive "C"--but believe deserve
 put table. first economic political difficulty, call "reverse"
 soft landing. view monetary policy implementation 1996 attempt
 achieve conventional soft landing. involved slowing expansion trend
 overshot capacity, thereby stabilizing inflation extending expansion. already
 seen difficult muster public support even sensible policy
 effort. Given recent decline unemployment rate, might need monetary
 policy attempting reverse soft landing approach capacity
 thus require period below-trend growth allow actual output drift back
 capacity. Perhaps point, would period below-trend growth raise
 unemployment rate back NAIRU. policy difficult sell difficult
 achieve. might argued case best attempt slow
 economy trend, hope best, react necessary clear persistent signs
 higher inflation. wonder factor encouraging accept reactive posture.
 second consideration, one increasingly talked about, policy priority
 sustaining high-pressure economy, one close capacity, may increased.
 
 5/20/97
 Achieving maximum sustainable employment would ensure environment would
 reduce tensions challenges associated welfare reform associated
 movement welfare work. Given continued uncertainty NAIRU,
 argued opportune time experiment allowing unemployment rate
 decline further, even best guess current NAIRU, ensure avoid
 sacrificing employment could possibly sustained without accelerating inflation.
 think provocative arguments reactive posture. not,
 however, sway preference cautiously preemptive stance. still aiming
 avoid overheating sustain expansion. like version "C," accept
 Chairman's version "B," take "go slow" strategy retreat
 reactive policy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree lot
 similarities 1920s. want end way. [Laughter] don't even
 know call next decade years 2000 counted single digits.
 get teens, I'll fine. expect end career next decade,
 want labeled "the great contraction." see growing chance 1990s

 label like "soaring 1990s" something like that. scholars say
 errors made starting 1927 sowed seeds happened 1929 afterward.

 compelling. started career Fed 1967, year policy mistakes
 made. System 1977, another year policy mistakes started
 
 5/20/97
 made. System 1987; lot were, remember well
 kind year was. 1997, think need cautious
 shortsighted regarding much momentum built expansion.
 productivity-supply side arguments right much strength
 economy, must true, 1920s, real interest rates quite bit
 higher gotten used to. think Al Broaddus's argument earlier
 Chairman's remarks say accept idea, maybe try sell story
 critics, high real interest rates sign strong, healthy economy
 bad thing.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, like others around table, would like
 move steadily persistently toward price stability measured somehow.
 require tightening think economy could absorb tightening rather
 well. However, also apparent me--I commented earlier--that
 require debate, perhaps within Committee certainly public.
 make greater effort educate public accept need
 tightening policy. reason, would accept support
 recommendation encourage us make conscientious effort improve public
 educational activities.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. tough meeting, Mr. Chairman, think
 good one lot constructive comments. Early meeting, Jerry Jordan
 
 5/20/97
 summed best said choice may well moving little
 moving lot later on. Let make couple observations.
 recognize significant upside risks. repeat
 everybody else said, key upside risk expansion may slow
 trend projected. problem is, course, going know sure.
 find growth well trend point road, could find
 box very, difficult choices. lot focus
 uncertainty commentary around table, certainly great deal
 uncertainty. agree Bill McDonough greater uncertainty induce greater
 caution, think need careful let uncertainty paralyze us.
 attending meetings since 1973 always lot uncertainty.
 may little average meeting experience
 much more.
 respect productivity, glad highlighted today, Mr.
 Chairman. think providing useful service Committee
 country emphasizing may well midst significant increase trend
 productivity growth. Again, far short run concerned, necessarily
 mean nominal rates need go up, certainly imply real rates need
 increase. another factor thinking.
 always, policy matter balancing risks. Let tell
 recognize risk moving today. think also substantial risk, view
 greater risk, move now. would reiterate point Tom Melzer made
 longer-term goal price stability. certainly need keep mind go forward.
 
 5/20/97
 Someone mentioned today core CPI flat; actually growth rate flat
 index still moving up. lose track longer-term goal.
 going try make progress toward goal, good time try achieve it.
 think need move today. beginning 1994. funds rate
 already 5-1/2 percent, saying need make terribly robust move,
 believe 1/4 percentage move would appropriate today.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, policy choice comes assessing
 alternative risks. appears risk associated raising funds rate
 smaller risk raising it. tighten policy action turns
 unnecessary, would slow expansion bit, would relatively little risk
 prolonged period weakness. raise funds rate inflation rate
 begins show clear upward trend, long lags policy mean could end
 problem hands.
 basis considerations, would prefer raise funds rate 25
 basis points meeting. However, since see possible pickup inflation
 imminent, willing, somewhat reluctantly, support policy change funds
 rate time asymmetric language even though believe running
 risk larger rate increase later.
 Finally, much look forward next meeting opportunity us
 reconsider decision change rate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 
 5/20/97
 MS. MINEHAN. think analysis quite similar Bob Parry's. need
 assess risks face costs wrong action take. I, too,
 view staying put policy action.
 noted earlier, risks growth rapid inflation
 difficult seem continue strongly asymmetric. fact, thought
 Greenbook forecast reasonable probability realized, probably could live
 it. forecast pretty good economic outcome. think good
 probability coming about. view, additional amount tightening necessary
 provide extra source constraint economy keep healthy track.
 discussion productivity extremely interesting, Mr. Chairman, end seemed
 sense potential need tightening point year.
 tighten 25 basis points wrong
 everything started come least well Greenbook sees it, maybe even
 little slower? costs wrong way unacceptably high? think so,
 one reasons argument psychological impact
 markets. meet group investment managers fairly regular basis.
 discussions recent weeks continually focused availability credit,
 liquidity markets, excesses see everywhere, particularly
 comes commercial real estate financing. Rather feeding sense caution

 5/20/97
 stand pat wrong? course, timing everything
 perhaps really doesn't matter whether tighten July August whenever
 meet rest year. think delaying stand lose bit
 markets, mentioned, also stand lose high ground advocating proactive
 monetary policy. need reduce risk overshooting, time
 fast growth tight labor markets, it?
 it's worth, group investment managers spent lot
 time meeting discussing saw potential outside sources resistance
 Fed moves, along line Tom Hoenig reflecting comments earlier.
 advice, it's worth, right thing. them, right
 thing tighten bit markets rein potential inflation get
 hand. believe right policy 25 basis point move. again, timing
 everything. think current policy stance far away be, Mr.
 Chairman, could support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stem.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. admit feel little like
 Dr. Watson Sherlock Holmes. wove together strands reconciled
 various puzzles worried about. Whatever else may going on,
 know period economic growth lengthened, gains employment
 outpaced would seem consistent demographic trends normally would
 generate terms labor force growth reasonable long-term trend participation
 rates hours worked. So, still little cautious
 economy performing.
 
 5/20/97
 would add continue agree basic concern risks
 demand outpace supply experience buildup inflationary
 pressures. feel absolutely urgent act concern meeting.
 said that, ran chronology Jerry Jordan referred earlier
 meeting arrived close conclusion. is, think delay
 action now, may find confronting circumstances convinced
 confident need policy tightening move persuasive explanation
 perhaps November. Now, know waiting November would turn
 fatal error, find out? seem circumstances today ought
 persuade us wait long run risk waiting long. So, would certainly
 prefer modest tightening now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.
 MR. BOEHNE. decision comes balancing need
 insurance versus wait-and-see. persuaded wait-and-see argument.
 is, look it, upside risk demand side future, also upside
 potential supply side, consistently underestimated. one
 unifying theme pick travel around District,
 developments really enhancing productivity working way
 supply side. think proactive monetary policy take demand side
 supply side account. want see problems proactive sense, also need
 see benefits proactive sense. think reasonable bet wait-and-see
 attitude, particularly since current monetary policy loose. probably somewhat
 
 5/20/97
 restrictive, don't think far behind curve even making mistake
 tightening today. quite comfortable "B" asymmetric proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, intended say something much like
 President Boehne said. Let simply associate remarks concur
 recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. Thanks, Alan. think inflation risks upside,
 said before, believe would prudent take additional insurance

 made earlier--I know Al Broaddus made others probably well--we cannot
 lose sight important credibility assuring kind economic climate
 enjoyed recent years. confidence people going keep

 Finally, think inaction part anything stem

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.
 MS. PHILLIPS. could support "B" symmetric asymmetric.
 strong feelings symmetry question move intermeeting
 period, think would kind consultation. think tightening
 eventually going needed, since inflation rather benign recently, seems
 room wait bit longer. said last time, sure federal

 expansion productivity moved us higher growth potential. seem
 time let things play bit more, think would best
 conserve monetary tools now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. preference additional
 point tightening, support recommendation today. event, certainly
 would support asymmetrical directive. view hour, repeat
 arguments. possible payback staying ahead inflationary pressures many us
 think probably building weighed small downside risk modest
 tightening fully employed, solid economy leads conclude somewhat less
 accommodative policy would reasonable explainable.
 would like add, talk policy options, always seem
 constrained insufficient focus longer run. Without better defined better
 articulated goal, whatever decide goal needs be, meeting becomes exercise

 Although I, too, see need tightening year, accept
