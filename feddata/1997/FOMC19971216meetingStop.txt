 Going back top panel, would like draw two points. One

 "you may call temporary easing." took mean

 main purpose panels remind us bad
 thunderstorm something like 100-year flood. top panel

 currencies overshot fundamental values. think it's
 important recognize still large position overhang

 brief. thought, however, would offer remarks
 tougher calls make domestic side forecast--namely
 relating outlook wages, stock market, capital
 spending.
 that, however, words morning's statistics:
 CPI--total core--increased 0.1 percent November.
 twelve-month changes 1.8 percent total CPI 2.2 percent
 core--the total tenth Q4/Q4 forecast core right it.
 Housing starts rose slightly last month. expected
 dropback. upside surprise lower value multifamily
 segment, held high level. it's worth, told
 may result new seasonal pattern related efforts qualify
 tax breaks low-income housing projects. We'll look
 further. Single-family starts little, permits down,
 important segment looks broadly line prediction
 flatness.
 back main theme, tougher issues
 projection. first noted outlook wages. know,
 forecast wages total compensation decelerate slightly
 next year, face continued low unemployment. certainly
 arguing labor market tight. heard anecdotes
 read surveys, have, persuaded finding
 retaining qualified workers major problem employers. many
 firms continue report anything
 avoid raising wage bills--including even forgoing expansion
 opportunities--wage increases creeping now.
 gut tells pressure building labor market pot
 lid could blow off. But, better worse, forecast
 shaped visceral sensation. particular, given major
 weight observations wages rather inertial
 significantly affected perceived trends prices. And, point,
 workers employers looking low inflation past year,
 seeing longer, given
 conditions goods markets. net result forecast still hefty
 rise real wages marked increase labor share
 income pie--but upward wage-price spiral.
 Another tough call relates stock market outlook. know,
 light reassessment prospects inflation,
 eliminated prior assumption increase federal funds rate.

 viewed tightening important trigger marked downturn
 market first half next year. question us, then,
 whether disappointing corporate earnings alone could expected
 produce significant correction long. answer yes,
 decline likely gradual smaller overall--about 15 percent
 yesterday's close early 1999. Question marks remain, however.
 date, individual companies industries punished bad
 earnings announcements, seemingly occasioned merely
 rotation sectors determined equity investors. So, could
 market shrug negative news forecasting? Perhaps, least
 while. Certainly, numbers, aggregate year-on-year profit
 comparisons begin look really poor next summer fall.
 said, though, think distinct possibility that,
 deterioration profits comes clearly view, market could develop
 even downward momentum anticipated. would note
 currently projecting low Wilshire 5000 1999
 would take back spring leave price-earnings
 multiples historically high levels. combination revised earnings
 expectations increase equity premium
 probably occurred recently would point much sizable decline,
 unless interest rates fall appreciably time.
 Finally, thoughts outlook business investment.
 sizable sector one provided lot propulsion
 expansion date. forecast significant deceleration capital
 spending, gets little circular, fits well predictions
 rising equity capital costs decelerating output. However,
 indications point investment plans strong going
 1998. example, semi-annual survey National Association
 Purchasing Managers indicated manufacturers expecting
 increase capital expenditures next year 15 percent--an even greater
 increment reported year. NFIB's November survey
 small firms also showed extremely upbeat investment plans.
 surveys underscore risk investment will, yet again, prove
 stronger gauged. But, reason doubt
 predictive power present case. one thing, even surveys
 merely weeks old, may still providing pretty stale readings.
 looking changing perception international
 outlook altered GDP projection past weeks, seems
 reasonable think businesses also reassessing plans
 many trimming investment budgets. wrong,
 
 12/16/97
 
 raise question whether capital spending boom won't
 come jarring end sometime road, firms finding
 excess capacity experiencing deeper hit profits.
 So, sum up, think provided realistic baseline forecast,
 still plenty puzzle over--and perhaps worry

 MR. TRUMAN. possibility certainly incorporated worse case scenario
 laid out, though effect may big would argue could be. Let
 go back one premises. Although 40 percent adjustment China's official

 conducted unofficial exchange rate. So, although sign certainly right, we, unlike
 commentators, think depreciation major cause developments.

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, pace economic growth Twelfth Federal

 first half year. Despite slowdown, economic activity expanding rapidly
 District states nation whole. Employment growth District continues

 regard inflation, reduced forecast since November meeting.
 Certainly, continued appreciation dollar help hold prices. Secondly,

 encouraging, may reasonable build modest reduction future inflation

 Given considerations, expect price inflation hold steady 1998

 activity picked sharply November according latest monthly survey. However,
 also heard number reports weaker auto sales course last several weeks,
 recent anecdotal reports indicate housing may softening little high level.
 Commercial real estate activity, contrast, appears remain strong, especially
 Washington area generally around District whole. Elsewhere, manufacturing activity

 apparently resulting buildup wage pressures least sectors

 Turning national picture, say found abrupt revisions
 Greenbook projections surprising, least extent. Actually, month's real growth

 tightening monetary policy. November Greenbook, significant tightening
 assumed occur course 1998. understand, course, change reflects
 potential negative fallout Asian problems U.S. economy, clear
 discussion Greenbook terms likely outcome recent
 developments changed outlook substantially projections indicate.
 Let make four observations quickly. First, November
 meeting expressed concern widespread view financial markets Fed policy
 hold, least time being, preventing long-term interest rates playing
 usual automatic stabilizer role. view, market reaction November employment
 reports strong evidence point view concern. report much
 stronger expected. strength across board, report included hourly

 markets hardly reacted all. appears markets think thing make
 us react fairly substantial jump CPI inflation. labor markets tight are,
 
 30
 
 12/16/97
 
 think absence usual stabilizer mechanism coming long-term interest rates
 significant upside risk outlook, believe needs given considerable weight
 along whatever weight give Asian problem.
 Second, key element Greenbook's new projections estimate
 Asian crisis double decline U.S. net exports 1998 projected
 November Greenbook net exports reduce real GDP growth one percentage
 point next year. don't know exactly estimate arrived at. importantly,
 clear sense staff would say confidence interval around
 estimate. think would helpful know that, given extent changes
 projections, although Ted's answer question helps put little quantitative
 dimension it. basic point net exports clearly present downside risks, need
 careful overstate weighing risks face
 outlook. talk globalization, U.S. economy still self-contained
 considerable extent.
 Third, flip side prospective widening U.S. current account deficit
 widening capital account surplus. Asian crisis, think know, redirected capital
 flows away emerging economies back toward industrial economies, especially U.S.
 economy. certainly part reason recent declines bond rates U.S.
 markets, think helped increase loanable funds banks. short, capital
 reflow occurring effects easing monetary policy. don't think
 Greenbook mentions this, wonder whether projections take account it.
 
 12/16/97
 Finally, appreciation dollar obviously reduce export demand,
 effect partially offset restraining effects dollar's appreciation prices.
 better inflation performance bolster real wage gains U.S. economy probably
 increase household confidence wage gains continue. could well keep
 consumption expenditures above-trend path add tightness labor
 markets.

 Let make one final comment flexibility. lot people used word
