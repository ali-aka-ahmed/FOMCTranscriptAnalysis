 MR. LEHNERT. Josh noted, everyone’s talking house prices;
 also seem talking great deal mortgages. popular consensus
 appears homebuyers, especially hot housing markets, make token
 payments scrape homes resorting interest-only

 average LTV fallen past 18 months.

 available underlying mortgages contain many heterodox
 mortgages, including interest-only mortgages. Many recent press articles

 Turning data, line 1 top left panel shows dollar value
 RMBS pools nearly doubled past two years. Moreover, shown
 line 2, RMBS pools backed interest-only, IO, mortgages increased almost
 sixfold, amount nearly $300 billion. However, total home mortgage
 debt, line 3, also increased past two years. shown memo line,
 interest-only RMBS pools account 3.6 percent home mortgage debt,
 less 1 percent two years ago, still small share mortgages.

 past three years. shown, IO mortgages LTVs 80
 percent, although trend time away lowest LTVs.
 said, lenders continued make relatively IO loans LTVs
 80 percent. higher LTV loans account 15 percent

 Finally, anecdotes often emphasize IO loans extended borrowers

 measured FICO scores, among IO borrowers. rough approximation,
 lenders define prime quality borrowers FICO scores 660 above.

 therefore, credit quality borrowers using interest-only loans appear
 particularly risky.
 One might wonder financial institutions investors have, face

 sum up, neither borrowers lenders appear particularly shaky. Indeed,
 evidence points opposite direction: borrowers large equity cushions,

 concludes prepared remarks.

 MR. PEACH. Well, let make couple observations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let stop you. You’ve made point. think
 responding data two colleagues. Let respond, respond them.
 MR. GALLIN. Loosely speaking, we’re trying get sense changes
 price typical home—what happening price time—adjusting quality.
 guess I’ll start concerns constant-quality figure, I’ll address Dick’s
 concerns transactions price index used.
 One reason worry constant-quality number, Dick alluded it, it’s
 constant-quality price index new homes, new homes typically built existing
 homes already situated. see drive city, basically. big
 developments outskirts cities, outskirts moving out.
 recognize cities multi-centered forth, new homes—while always built

 that. So, improvements affecting price appreciation one way, depreciation affecting
 way. take account, net effect tenths year. Now,
 things cumulate time, use data improvements depreciation remove
 biases published data. So, problems published data, don’t
 make published data.
 Likewise, there’s transactions bias. Homes appreciate tend transact more,
 that’s going bias upward published price index start with. studies
 size transactions bias. Dick provided data it. I’ve taken estimates size
 transactions bias removed published data. So, start published data,
 make various adjustments. One last point price index based mortgages

 So, final takeaway there’s perfect way measure house prices.

 Another thing we’ve observed, particularly metropolitan area, state

 MR. POOLE. I’d like comment also policy discussion. seems

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. wanted make couple comments
 also ask quick question. first comment relates run-up price-rent ratios we’ve
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 35 234
 
 seen. seems might couple factors could explain least portion
 run-up, though probably it, weren’t mentioned presentations.
 First, seems financial innovations affecting housing could improved
 view households regarding desirability housing asset held portfolios thus
 raised equilibrium price-to-rent relationship residential real estate. I’m thinking
 idea equity held residential real estate lot accessible today
 past. Home equity credit commercial banks fourfold since 1999, many households

 thing occurred might effects tax changes. We’ve
 changes rules tax exemption 1997 capital gains sale primary
 residences would make holding real estate assets attractive. changes capital
 gains taxes generally 1997 2003 would worked
 direction.
 One things looked thought interesting behavior
 price-rent ratios residential housing commercial office space. Commercial office space
 price-rent ratios highly cyclical—I guess always been—but appears
 behavior price-rent ratios residential housing closely mirrored we’ve seen
 commercial office space. ratios gone 30 35 percent since around
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 36 234
 
 1998, though dynamics totally different. Commercial office space rents falling—
 it’s prices rising—but price-rent ratios moved similarly.
 second comment wanted make concerns relationship creative finance
 housing market. One view think prevalent use credit form
 piggyback loans, interest-only mortgages, option ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages], forth,
 involves financial innovations feeding kind unsustainable bubble. alternative
 perspective high house prices, fact, curtailing effective demand housing
 point house appreciation probably poised slow. increasing use creative

 indication slowing hand. Previously, lenders applied rigid constraints loan-to­
 value ratios, essentially constraints eased margin
 creative financing techniques. that’s providing elasticity firm roof. may
 slightly diminish price elasticity demand housing, fact blossoming
 basically suggests really ceiling it’s binding ultimately
 constrain appreciation.
 Finally, two comments, question. concerns presentation Andreas
 numbers cited loan-to-value ratios origination. One things we’re seeing
 California elsewhere District—and maybe true nationwide—is growing use
 piggyback loans. Loan-to-value ratios 90 95 percent common California, we’ve
 even seen combination loan-to-value ratios piggyback loans going 125 percent. guess
 means two things, one traditional first mortgage looks utterly conventional.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s worthwhile looking that. Sorry interruption.
 Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. couple questions. First all, concerning scenario 20
 percent decline housing prices: weighted extent? weighted would
 reduce froth increased valuation occurred certain point? would
 simply take total amount value reduce number 20 percent?
 MR. WILLIAMS. I’m latter—reducing overall housing wealth 20
 percent relative base.
 MR. OLSON. Josh’s 20 percent, assume implicit weighting,
 not? Would 20 percent increase value reflect extent greater run-up value
 areas like California large numbers properties increased significantly
 value others?
 MR. GALLIN. It’s basically value-weighted measure.
 MR. OLSON. is. aggregate divided number housing units?
 would think would implicit weighting calculation. If, fact,
 decline value—the Nasdaq effect, words—were represent return normal
 increases occurred, would affected extent risk exposure?
 MR. WILLIAMS. terms FRB/US model, way house prices
 housing wealth enter aggregate.

 MR. OLSON. see.
 MR. WILLIAMS. So, one shortcomings, even model several hundred
 equations, doesn’t distribution effects.
 MR. OLSON. two parts that. One overall impact model.
 second that, extent risk embedded underlying mortgages, would tend
 run-up higher. I’m going talk little bit tomorrow.
 second point land value. assessed valuation get county—I’ve
 frightened recent years look it—doesn’t break land value
 improvements? assume that’s public knowledge, not? So, presumably, could access
 number. recollection residential appraisals three different methodologies
 used, one looks improvements vis-à-vis land value. would guess
 information available.
 third point visual observation, incidence teardowns
 market like this. asymmetry land value value
 improvements, see increase teardowns. Locally, trend started D.C.
 moved neighborhood. critical component, seems me,
 buying decision. think data would available.
 one follow-up question something Chairman mentioned. Somebody suggested
 recently—I heard different figure this—that private pools mortgage-backed
 loans larger GSE pools. seen recent data effect?
 MR. LEHNERT. United States. don’t know country planet—

 MR. LEHNERT. beg pardon. course, stock differences enormous.
 flow difference, net, GSE guaranteed mortgages pools small extent

 RMBS sector.
 MR. OLSON. That’s true. That’s good point. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Following Governor Ferguson’s question, would imagine one
 differences tremendous variations market market.
 Chairman’s question proportion housing prices attributable land value, would
 assume local regulation restrictions land use. example, look
 numbers homes considered permit construction Southern
 California—that includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange County—in ’80s
 100,000 plus range. year it’s 37,000, part imposition highly restrictive
 regulations land use. look permits current construction single-family homes
 North Carolina, almost restrictions whatsoever, it’s 50,000.
 So, question is: assume land price percentage house price
 function regulatory restrictions imposed land use construction?
 way measure this? ask strikes me—and I’ve thinking countries
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 41 234
 
 well, Spain interesting example—that monetary policy would blunt general tool
 if, indeed, significant variations city city, state state, market market.
 MR. GALLIN. I’ll leave monetary policy aspect colleagues. let make
 couple points land use restriction. Certainly, land use restrictions, environmental
 restrictions, types things played role rapid rise house prices.
 certainly factor. mentioned briefing like compare house prices rent—and
 one reasons—as opposed comparing incomes. increased regulation boosts
 house prices, people going pay income housing
 regulations put place. land use restrictions affect rents well. So, drive
 cost buying home, also drive cost renting home.
 significant factor, elements.
 somewhat aside, find interesting. talk lot builders part
 day-to-day work here, I’ve asked issue. say definitely land
 use restriction big concern them. also went back looked newspaper articles
 written ’86, ’87, ’88, ’89, it’s truly remarkable view back housing
 prices could never fall because, people saying left right, buildable
 land left due environmental regulations land use restrictions. saying right
 1989 house prices leveled nominal terms. I’m saying things aren’t real—
 builders say real—but they’re certainly new though may new
 effects. get back point, think captured price rent
 data.
 MR. PEACH. one follow-up comment. There’s lot evidence suggest
 good part reason rapid rise home prices California, Washington, D.C., along
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 42 234
 
 East Coast, example, relatively inelastic supply—not demand
 necessarily stronger. That’s pretty clear data. Whether it’s due land use restrictions
 factors, fact already fairly densely populated areas there’s definitely
 inelastic supply areas country.
 MR. FISHER. would imagine would driven also kind margins
 suppliers capture. verisimilitude, talked Hovnanian, builds 20,000
 homes year roughly $300,000 apiece. margins squeezed California,
 less restrictive areas capture greater amount, obviously gravitates
 capture greatest margin. that’s one example, common sense would suggest
 applies broadly.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. argument rapid rise land prices 1837

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. remember bubble! [Laughter] two
 questions. first John Williams perhaps Dave Stockton. right way

 MR. WILLIAMS. think Greenbook forecast, understand it—and maybe Dave

 monetary theory would tell come best, reasonable forecast adopt

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. second question policy, monetary
 policy. Glenn, note, allude instruments monetary policy doesn’t seem
 appropriate tool address concern lower value prices. know
 history use supervisory tool past periods concern real estate bubbles
 imprudent lending? rich history use instruments tells us
 something efficacy foresight deploying them?
 MR. LACKER. It’s called real bills doctrine.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Since bills doctrine. [Laughter]
 MR. RUDEBUSCH. Since you’re going British Embassy, might note
 United Kingdom used allow loan-to-value origination 120 percent. could buy

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You’re biasing answer. [Laughter]
 MR. FERGUSON. answer obviously “yes.” [Laughter]
 MR. LACKER. understanding we’ve used fairly often postwar period,
 ’60s, ’70s, ’80s—in early 1980, example. understanding hasn’t worked
 well. times we’ve tried jawbone banking system’s allocation
 credit.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. history one using late, using
 effect ways get money?
 MS. BIES. May say something here? don’t quantitative studies this,
 based talking folks lived it, I’d make couple observations. look
 1980s—the recent housing bubble nationwide. saw bubble bursting
 nationally opposed pockets we’ve California breakdown Boston
 breakdown, really related local economies local employment developments.
 think local economic employment situations drivers delinquencies,
 regulators generally missed missed local economic impact. think people
 focus fact cycles driven local economic conditions.
 think period 1980s involved broader failure part supervisors.
 compare 1980s experience happening now, earlier period lot financial
 institutions exam cycle went five six years. So, nobody supervisory side
 looking going on. period time securitization
 became prevalent practice, risk carried books banks. Also, many
 banks hit badly following developers—going footprint
 lending properties didn’t know. think one risks today big
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 46 234
 
 banks say diversified geographically, many loans investors
 purchasers second-home resort properties. So, lenders following customers
 local area, location new property local lenders aren’t looking it;
 customer’s lender handling transaction. So, still may risk embedded within
 financial institutions. It’s one things we’re focusing on.
 new time, though, lot nonconforming products
 securitized private sector. real question is: market discipline
 kick in? supervisors, fault institution responding market need
 offloading loans risk types mortgage structures Andreas
 describing? clearly could financial institutions buying equity mezzanine risk
 tranches risks back institutions’ books. many cases clearly isn’t
 happening. So, different aspects time around.
 let everybody know, OCC [Office Comptroller Currency]
 Fed currently putting together horizontal review look fringe kind lending activities
 need send signals. wrote HELOC [home equity line credit]
 guidance came last month. We’re working one hope
 couple months. don’t want turn safe loans traditional types lending activities,
 need figure go practices fringes.
 haven’t done sterling job. think that’s we’re trying send guidance. sent
 appraisal guidance year ago. risky practices past starting
 repeated, may generation lenders didn’t live problems before.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Shall break coffee?
 [Coffee break]
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 47 234
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. wanted make comments
 ask question. First, I’d say concerns froth housing markets, found
 presentations informative, want congratulate people spent lot
 time preparing them. thought good presentations. also found
 information comforting. We’ve talked possibility local housing bubbles
 regional housing bubbles, clearly United States. never really
 looked national basis before. net result come away analysis
 feeling worse probably little better.
 First, thought helpful see quantified—I think Josh’s memo—the
 size potential bubble. talked 20 percent drop housing prices.
 equal 30 percent GDP compared drop equity prices had,
 twice that. Also, feeling appropriate monetary policy, John said, could
 mitigate much distress might occur. Moreover, credit risk associated home
 mortgages seems spread across many institutions. Governor Bies said lot analysis
 done now, we’ll want see results analysis Board
 Comptroller doing. whole, financial institutions seem pretty good shape.
 role securitizing mortgages lay risks parties willing able bear
 risks. Capital levels financial institutions relatively high, appears markets
 performing roles well. event sharp drop housing prices, odds
 spillover financial institutions seem limited. mentioned, helpful hear
 suggestion monetary policy effective responding sharp drop—if one—in
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 48 234
 
 housing prices. come away somewhat less concerned size consequences
 housing bubble before.
 question relates Governor Yellen asking about—financial innovation.
 going make similar point. fact great deal financial
 innovation housing markets United States. average person borrow easily
 home days. wondering been—or possible do—any
 international comparisons this. wondered whether price-rent ratios countries
 may degree financial innovation we’ve differ substantially ours.
 MS. JOHNSON. Well, trust receive aware background document
 circulated foreign experience.
 MR. MOSKOW. Yes.
 MS. JOHNSON. didn’t price-rent ratios, given Josh described terms
 care put feels something close right number, think
 might feel little hesitant so. take back; price-rent ratios—[laughter] back
 portion paper. data have, used. huge variations financing
 practices housing markets across foreign countries. degree securitization
 less here. Practices respect tax-favored treatment borrowing finance houses
 differ relative United States. There’s host different characteristics, terms
 variable-rate, fixed-rate, types instruments used various foreign countries.
 one things paper intended point prevalence really rapid
 rises house prices. According chart—the first pages right anyway—
 shows increase price-rent ratios well. So, refer back paper.
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 49 234
 
 subset countries covered price-rent charts,
 paper.
 MR. MOSKOW. can’t really associate degree financial innovation
 we’ve United States great variability? you’re saying,
 Karen?
 MS. JOHNSON. guess wouldn’t necessarily associate with, say, development
 secondary market ease equity extraction, sorts things, I’m saying
 they’re irrelevant. example, chart, Switzerland—which country think
 made little progress regard—doesn’t much price-rent ratio increase.
 U.K., market-oriented approach, huge one.
 it’s also true that’s price differences been. think we’d hardpressed link tightly increased liquidity ascribe U.S. home equity
 taken role single driving factor anyway. might relevant, don’t know
 distinguishes countries.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also want thank authors
 papers—the international paper well papers talked today—because
 found helpful reassuring, along lines Michael Moskow discussing.
 also thought Janet’s comments financial innovations insightful. Despite fact
 it’s hard sort U.S. experience vis-à-vis countries, whole point this—to
 anyway—is we’re seeing phenomenon housing markets. question is:
 fundamentals explain don’t they? financial innovations certainly part mix,
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 50 234
 
 terms changes fundamentals. So, extent they’ve made many transactions
 housing market easier do, impact underlying asset prices.
 thought argument interesting one, interesting see
 way one tease effects that.
 second point look relationship rising prices either
 OFHEO constant-quality index disposable income opposed median household
 income, see even reassuring chart. would think there’s least little bit logic
 that, based Dick Peach’s chart differences house-price acceleration
 depending income—with value higher-priced houses moving faster lower-priced
 houses. would think logic looking disposable income. know
 done charts. think every chart could do! [Laughter]
 interesting one sees perspective somewhat less acceleration somewhat
 reassuring picture.
 Finally, question, talked 20 percent decline house prices
 would terms basic macroeconomic effects it. But, course,
 wouldn’t happen overnight. Something would make happen. And, consider current
 policy stance, one conundrums—though hate use word—is haven’t 10-year
 yield and, therefore, mortgage interest rates, taken upward path rates short end
 curve. question asking myself—and think it’s probably difficult figure
 out—was point is, mortgage rates start go up, look affordability
 curve start worry households beginning get trouble. would
 impact house prices. Obviously, higher interest rates would tend level house prices take
 down. also would impact, things equal, people’s ability afford
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 51 234
 
 house they’re in. far interest rates go affordability curve starts
 move direction causes problem regard?
 MR. GALLIN. look housing affordability picture—basically relating house
 prices interest rates income—it moving around fairly stable favorable
 area last, say, 8 10 years.
 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 MR. GALLIN. know, mortgage rates moving
 balance flattened bit past years, compare, say, 2003 now.
 happening time period affordability edging lower end
 range fluctuated while. There’s nothing scary it, affordability
 moving down. Certainly, take argument little further. mortgage rates stay
 pretty stable disposable income keeps rising reasonable rates, affordability going start
 looking worse worse keep getting house-price gains we’ve seeing. That’s
 necessarily argument overvaluation undervaluation. argument view
 recent increases house-price gains sustainable. rates flatten out, affordability
 start deteriorate fairly significantly.
 MS. MINEHAN. rates flatten rise?
 MR. GALLIN. rates flatten out; that’s would getting kick
 lower rates. House prices go housing remains affordable rates lower.
 flatten stay flat, one might think it’s going hard house-price gains keep
 humming along way they’ve going. That’s going start eat affordability.
 MS. MINEHAN. Okay. guess coming way.
 MR. GALLIN. I’m sorry, then.
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 52 234
 
 MS. MINEHAN. No, no. Let think while. Go on.
 MR. STOCKTON. Let make one point reasons may
 increase equilibrium price-rent ratio, certainly agree President
 Yellen good reasons. reasons could well include financial innovation,
 changes capital gains taxation, supply constraints. However, lots asset price
 misalignments start situations good reasons prices rising
 rapidly. Productivity innovation changes business models, forth, think
 probably valid explanations increase stock market prices, doesn’t mean—
 MS. MINEHAN. Right.
 MR. STOCKTON. probably valid explanations stock market rise
 ’90s, didn’t necessarily, end, go way explaining far valuations
 moved, even somewhat solid economic impetus begin with.
 MS. MINEHAN. thinking primarily affordability issue. know
 affordability ratio involves least three things moving simultaneously—the value houses,
 disposable income, interest rates. less looking interest rate component.
 MR. STOCKTON. Okay.
 MS. MINEHAN. wondering interest rates moving instead moving
 affects affordability.
 MR. GALLIN. It’s going make housing significantly—
 MS. MINEHAN. Well, yes, breaking point? 10-year rate goes 1
 percentage point, say, going get worried whether people afford houses?
 range rate rise shouldn’t concerned?
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 53 234
 
 MR. GALLIN. certainly wouldn’t want say breaking point there.
 again, going back conversations I’ve homebuilders, it’s worth,
 indicate they’re going worried unless see increase—and one occurs
 fast—on order 100 basis points.
 MS. MINEHAN. 1 percentage point, 100 basis points, short amount time—
 MR. GALLIN. Yes, that’s based talking builders, opposed
 firm statistical analysis. would cautious. would certainly hesitate draw firm
 conclusion particular increase tipping point breaking point.
 MR. PEACH. could add point: spring ’87, rapid increase
 rates—200 basis points—as 1994, housing market proved
 surprisingly resilient face fairly steep increases.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. three questions. first one
 price-to-rent ratio. We’ve treating adjustment come prices.
 wanted ask Josh particularly whether, you’ve looking micro data thinking
 this, dynamics innovations led shift renting home
 ownership might artificially depressed rents relative prices. wondered, shift
 over, rents start rising faster close gap way—use 20 percent.
 question thought that. observation would present much
 difficult situation us sitting around table. would kind like supply shock
 prices would rising, inflation would higher—and homeowners’ equivalent rent
 would rising faster—and we’d face difficult situation. pretty much know
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 54 234
 
 house prices fall. That’s pure demand shock. rents start rising, that’s another matter.
 wondered you’d comment that.
 then, floor, let ask questions Glenn John. Glenn,
 1994 bubble analogy, surprised see classified bubble. think
 inflation scare then, also real rate adjustment time. looked
 surveys, think wouldn’t seen much increase inflation expectations. agree
 raise real rates order prevent happening. seems
 different animal equity price changes house-price changes responsible
 inflation. see inflation moving, we’ve got something that, whereas we’re
 responsible relative prices houses equity things. wouldn’t put 1994
 list situations might think we’re looking issue house-price gains.
 seems different. I’d like hear comment that.
 finally, question John point misallocation
 resources. Doesn’t matter state business cycle is? hadn’t many
 houses built much consumption last years, would
 unemployment. it’s obvious resources misallocated. resources went
 building houses, furniture, cars, forth might unemployed, especially
 raised rates order lean house-price increases. had, surely
 unemployment would higher. seems it’s one thing talk misallocating
 resources two states full employment, it’s another thing talk misallocation
 resources would otherwise slack economy. latter case don’t think
 really misallocation resources. There’s opportunity cost.
 MR. GALLIN. want start rents? give others time think.
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 55 234
 
 I’ve looked rent side picture. idea perhaps prices getting
 high relative rents, I’d argue they’re going come back line. Now, maybe rents going
 correcting, were. work I’ve done gives little hint
 evidence maybe rents bit correcting. So, might see going forward rent
 growth slightly higher otherwise would been. statistically speaking, it’s basically
 different zero. Statistically, doesn’t look like rents correcting. really
 seems happening rents go rate determined economic conditions
 prices move around them.
 MR. KOHN. don’t see anything current situation would differentiate
 past history regard. guess question.
 MR. GALLIN. not, certainly respect rents. would like say also
 agree comments financial innovations could well justifiable reason
 house prices higher usual relative prices. think things different.
 don’t see anything suggest worried rental inflation and, result,
 overall inflation.
 MR. RUDEBUSCH. regard equity prices bond prices, reason included
 comparison make couple points. one, comment often made can’t
 second-guess financial markets financial market participants. seems may true
 equity market participants less true bond market participants. take “inflation scare”
 “credibility gap” “conundrum” another term situation idea
 fundamentals we’re sure bond market participants thinking.
 Now, it’s true there’s difference clear idea reaction
 function monetary policy going presumably guide bond market participants
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 56 234
 
 transparency regarding notion fundamentals. clear difference
 markets. housing market different bond equity markets,
 question is: draw lessons? regional disparity completely different
 markets, that’s separate issue.
 event, one reason behind housing price appreciation, perhaps,
 low long rates. bond rate conundrum. Perhaps misalignment bond prices leading
 misalignment housing prices. So, one could perhaps make argument it’s bond
 price experience 1994 may relevant one today. think I’ll stop leave
 that.
 MR. WILLIAMS. fact, third scenario considered involved trying emphasize
 point—namely that, least measures people come with, big
 difference bond rates relative standard estimates fundamentals. It’s actually
 much bigger problem economy house-price effect directly, least according
 FRB/US model. importantly, could one factors driving big part houseprice appreciation. terms needing strong house prices keep economy moving, way
 view third question weren’t house-price run-up, monetary policy would need
 easier, given current economic conditions. think that’s absolutely right.
 One way think scenarios reverse signs, especially scenarios 1
 2, think positive stimulus we’ve gotten 20 percent appreciation
 housing prices positive effect we’ve gotten factors. Especially
 scenario 1, think see way.
 reason mentioned misallocation resources toward housing-related activities
 presentation quite bit economic academic research bubbles, emphasis
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 57 234
 
 actually lead to, Glenn mentioned, misallocation resources. Therefore, gaps
 fundamental prices actual prices appear policymaker’s objective function,
 addition inflation, output employment. notion that’s another
 problem would want balance could.
 Now, I’d like emphasize closing remarks assumption could affect
 bubble problematic. Josh mentioned, relationships housing
 prices interest rates strong one would think strong economic
 theory would suggest.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. hell it, I’d like offer hypothesis property values
 low rather high. [Laughter] believe Treasury indexed bonds good
 measure real rate interest—and getting discussion—the real rate
 interest cut half past five years. asset perpetual stream returns,
 like land, capital value doubled. Now, may well issue indexed
 bonds housing prices. may right way state hypothesis
 instead say conundrum there’s disconnect prices
 assets.
 event, going world real rate interest truly much
 lower before—if going situation time come—then seems
 could expect long-continuing appreciation land values particular.
 Residential structures long life, almost priced way. let link
 analysis tear-down phenomenon Mark Olson talking about. I’ve told—I don’t
 know data here—that houses replacing tear-downs may account 300,000 units year,
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 58 234
 
 significant part new building. Maybe someone knows data demolitions
 replacements. don’t.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s roughly right number.
 MR. POOLE. Okay. It’s significant part total new construction. know
 community live—I thought real estate hype bought house—we
 told bought land got house free. that’s case,
 houses area—a subdivision built 1960s—are torn down, houses
 3,000 square feet replaced houses 6,000 8,000 square feet nice one-acre lots.
 land value significant.
 question really happening land values urban areas, don’t know
 whether data available answer that. suppose detailed look real estate records tax
 records, enough resources it, would enable look properties
 houses torn replaced new homes. would probably give
 pretty good measure underlying value land areas. event, real rates
 interest come down, one would expect see increases value land relative
 structure. one would expect, think, see teardowns. gather that, though it’s
 brand-new phenomenon, scale probably much increased recent years 10 20
 years ago.
 rate, offer observations because, world going
 much lower real rates interest time come, one would expect see price-to-rent
 ratio go up. Maybe line chart another 40 percent go get equilibrium!
 [Laughter]
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 59 234
 
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I’d like propose buy house Washington,
 [laughter] given confidence.
 MR. POOLE. I’m right, won’t need buy it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. observation question happening mix
 mortgage products last 12 18 months. 2003, saw refinancings peak;
 2004, total originations went $3.8 trillion $2.8 trillion. dropped
 continuing soft year. happened 12- to18-month period time
 number ARMs shot half originations. based anecdotal evidence,
 ARMs still seem running least pace. Initially, rates record lows relative
 prevailing last 40 plus years, made sense rational consumers locking
 mortgage rates getting houses could afford.
 Now, embarked year ago today path raising interest rates. haven’t
 comparable movement long end, long-term rates basically were.
 many ARMs generated? affordability issue? mortgage
 broker issue, brokers want get deal cost? happening? I’ve heard
 folks say, “Well, ARM way loan now, we’ll turn around fixed
 rate next year.”
 MR. LEHNERT. Okay, let try answer question. can’t really comment
 hype mentality mortgage broker uses high pressure sales tactic. 2004,
 example, believe that, ARMs originated, less 10 percent traditional
 ARMs one-year reset period. remaining 90 percent hybrids rate lock
 feature borrower protected interest rate movements period time.
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 60 234
 
 data little difficult get, looks median rate lock period five years.
 think people’s typical tenure houses, five years isn’t bad guess long people
 going stay particular house. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is, effect, hybrid
 mortgage resets day move. So, think degree financial innovation,
 one people learning advertising press whatever. believe
 type hybrid ARM probably makes sense lot people making decision
 mortgage loan.
 point I’d make fraction originations ARMs often
 overstate role ARMs total mortgage market, people refinance ARMs
 fixed-rate mortgages frequently. fact, I’ve read Wall Street newsletters
 people seem believe current rate refinancing elevated flow ARMs
 fixed-rate loans.
 MS. BIES. Well, going next question. part
 older 3-, 5-, 7-year ARMs, 2005 initial wave 3-year ARMs
 first bump-up rates refinanced existence.
 MR. LEHNERT. Right.
 MS. BIES. numbers I’ve seen suggest next three years 60 percent
 ARMs going rate bumped refinanced. So, look
 cumulative impact this—I’m going back affordability issue—what really see
 happening going forward mortgages?
 MR. LEHNERT. Well, say, rates going reset, households make
 decisions whether refinance different point yield curve. people decide
 move. don’t think there’s going catastrophe average reset date that—
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 61 234
 
 MS. BIES. matter fast rates move up.
 MR. LEHNERT. Obviously, rates went sharply, could problem.
 MR. STOCKTON. think terms environment forecasting
 occur. It’s pretty tame interest rate environment; it’s one necessarily generate
 significant concerns costs reset mortgages. Now, obviously, could wrong
 directions. One could imagine situation rates rose faster. that’s one
 channels monetary policy traction economy; households face higher rates,
 would curtail spending response that. presumably you’d raising rates
 rapidly because, essence, needed restraint aggregate demand. would
 welcome result, long wasn’t precipitating big nonlinear type event terms
 people responding very, sharply kind change environment.
 MS. BIES. second question relates nature price decline risk.
 ARMs can’t refinanced foreclosures actually start occur—where financial
 institutions take property—are studies indicate much
 foreclosure volume could hit market material impact local house prices?
 MR. LEHNERT. recent studies I’m aware of. proposed study

 think happens—it’s like old redlining issue—is first foreclosures occur

 third point: Janet raised thought interesting idea earlier people

 conditions labor market sufficiently uninviting cause workers

 workers available rejoin labor force—and great
 enough numbers hold participation rate steady despite declining trend.
 middle left panel shows broad measure conditions labor market—
 total hours worked relative trend. measure combines effects
 unemployment gap, participation rate gap, gap workweek relative
 trend, shown currently zero. see chart, total
 hours worked remain little estimated trend despite recent gradual
 improvement labor market conditions.
 idea labor market slack remains corroborated
 indicators. example, shown middle right panel, individuals still perceive
 jobs somewhat harder get first half 1997, labor
 markets seemed roughly equilibrium. Similarly, shown lower left
 panel, NFIB [National Federation Independent Business] reports small
 businesses still encountering quite much difficulty filling positions
 first half 1997. also note indicators suggest
 labor market least tight early 1997. example, shown
 lower right panel, percent employed people working part-time economic
 reasons fallen average first half 1997.
 said, still see balance evidence suggesting little slack
 remains labor market, margin narrow, narrower today

 projection, essentially taken course next year half.
 things equal, past, labor market slack restrained growth
 nominal compensation thus helped keep price pressures check well.
 yet, shown upper left panel exhibit 5, compensation per hour

 another hefty increase first quarter year. shown black line
 right, even four-quarter basis, growth compensation per hour
 picked sharply last two quarters, raising question whether
 underlying compensation pressures building whether may feeding

 think not, two main reasons. First, shown blue line upper

 Cost Index], actually decelerating slightly since mid-2003, suggesting
 compensation situation may good deal less alarming one might conclude

 Among choices Vincent Reinhart’s note interest rates, I’m inclined support

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. issues us meeting two.
 first is: going dissuaded announced strategy another modest tightening
 monetary policy? second: palpable need adjust market expectations policy
 going forward?
 might dissuaded, feel obliged change market expectations one four
 circumstances; go order. first thought baseline
 forecast itself, think built basically around announced strategy, unacceptable.
 find baseline forecast basically acceptable, although somewhat concerned, President
 Lacker others already spoken, inflation drift seems upward.
 think risk there, large it’s basically acceptable forecast.
 second reason think would change strategy change policy terms
 announcements incoming data made basically acceptable forecast seem highly unlikely.
 I’d say incoming data, least real side economy, pretty much
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 141 234
 
 consistent baseline forecast. Consumption likely hold well, outlined
 baseline, labor markets appear gradually improving. David Wilcox indicated,
 unemployment rate edged little but, importantly standpoint,
 broader indicators labor market conditions seem consistent improvement.
 Economic conditions strengthened enough bring individuals back
 labor market, evidenced gradual rise labor force participation rate. also
 decline share individuals working part-time, economic reasons, shown exhibit 4
 chart show well. think tone survey data businesses
 households relatively positive. Moreover, continue believe low interest rates
 likely support wealth creation housing market, discussed extensively yesterday,
 little concern sudden fall-off regard. And, finally, respect business
 fixed investment, would say though investment-to-GDP ratio relatively low—a point
 return later—I agree assessment Greenbook fundamentals
 least consistent ongoing business fixed investment.
 inflation side, would say David handled incoming data well terms

 decrying conundra confronted, let least Michael wouldn’t
 do, venture hypothesis things true.
 respect fixed-income markets, reached conclusion—from
 various observations low rates flat yield curve—that explanation probably relates
 fact that, global level, domestic absorption fallen. I’m trying sort
 investment versus consumption. Overall think fallen would
 otherwise. suggests fall neutral rate, global slowdown—to cite two
 choices Vincent’s model. heavily persuaded work saw Monday,
 Janet mentioned, number real-side factors may holding back economy
 therefore reducing neutral rate.
 I’d also say investment-GDP ratio, quite low, fed fixedincome market performance led change corporate financing gap.
 1991 2000, financing gap rose less $35 billion peak $300
 billion. rise reflected sharp increase capital expenditures saw
 talked great deal telecom, high-tech, transportation sectors, etc. important
 thing financing gap fell abruptly 2001 2002, turned negative 2003, stayed
 negative fourth quarter last year. Due Microsoft dividend expiration
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 143 234
 
 accelerated tax depreciation, financing gap returned slightly positive territory first
 quarter. overall negative financing gap, widespread across industries,
 indicates business sector whole generating enough cash purchase capital
 expenditures without borrowing.
 also true dividend payout ratio relatively low. dividend payout
 ratio percentage S&P operating earnings turns be, based report I’ve
 received, 29 percent versus 48 50 percent averaged last 40 years so.
 it’s clear corporations really sort hoarding cash.
 Since corporations tend invest equities, tend invest number
 fixed-income securities relatively short term. think that’s one things driving
 relatively low interest rates. put final point that, since beginning 2003,
 liquid assets nonfinancial corporate sector rose $310 billion, 30
 percent, total $1.3 trillion. rate accumulation liquid assets slowed, think
 ratio still factor driving relatively low interest rate.
 equity markets, read data low volatility telling us better story
 rise equity risk premium we’ve seen. Steve pointed out, least implied,
 earnings-price ratio part equity risk premium really hasn’t changed much long
 periods time. still 5½ 6 percent range. really fixed-income side
 driving slight widening equity risk premium.
 final market signal think would important us read interest rates.
 people already talked interest rate signals we’ve seen. won’t belabor
 issue. pick point Janet made, number different measures
 inflation come markets others. Greenbook turns one
 
 June 29-30, 2005
 
 144 234
 
 best forecasters inflation. It’s reasonably good one. Philadelphia
 Federal Reserve District, example, survey professional economists also fairly good
 track record forecasting inflation. Janet pointed out, random walk—or least looking
 back recent inflation history—has good forecaster. good news us almost
 forecasts fall range that’s close Greenbook forecast, gives us perhaps
 comfort Greenbook forecast inflation right.
 final point I’d make—if remember, four reasons—is: Would
 dissuaded raising rates would change signal thought would create
 financial instability? regard, asked staff quick simulation effect
 rapid 1 percentage point rise fed funds rate Greenbook forecast. turns
 rash dramatically raise rates 1 percentage point
 baseline forecast, would create end 2006 rise financial obligation ratio
 6 basis points. won’t go math it, obviously fair amount
 fact vast majority mortgages country fixed-rate mortgages.
 second, definition, raise rates dramatically would result slowing
 economy, would see individuals take less debt. bottom line think strategy
 we’ve outlined, executed reasonable fashion, create financial instability.
 Let conclude saying think strategy right. don’t believe
 there’s reason change market expectations quite dramatically. think there’s
 downward pressure neutral rate, think Greenbook picked up. So,
 large, think appropriate course full steam ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
