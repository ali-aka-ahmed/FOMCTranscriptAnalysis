 so, think flexibl. agre governor ferguson need exit

 mayb todai right dai it, part ultim exit strategi, mai well

 someth futur, view craft simpl english sentenc two describ

 mr. kohn. thank you, mr. chairman. support propos, ¼ point increas
 fund rate altern b languag. think measur pace increas fund rate
 still best guess we’ll do. heard on two peopl around tabl sai
 might closer paus thought, ow recent data, on two peopl
 around tabl sai might acceler pace thei’re put
 emphasi incom inflat data. think broad center committe still
 measur pace increas and, therefor, broad center committe believ—i
 think—that ought tell market still think rate low rise.
 tell without tell someth remov accommod measur
 pace, think we’ll convei uncertainti intent would help.
 view, would help remov languag point.
 agre balanc-of-risk statement right broken either meaningless or,
 it’s meaning, it’s rather distort. think it’s go veri, hard remov without
 send signal think might behind curv on sens anoth, don’t
 think ar, don’t think want send signal. so, guess line 5 6
 go rework, point think we’re near paus point,
 don’t think that’s go june, presid moskow. i’d surpris were. think
 it’s go hard rework sentenc think we’re close finish
 tighten process. thank you, mr. chairman.

 mr. lacker. support 25 basi point altern b. agre
 soften statement meet. fact, read altern b, interpret
 tighten somewhat remov statement energi price fed notabl
 
 mai 3, 2005

 core consum price. anyth, lean toward tighter statement, think
 altern b would serv us well right now.
 want endors presid yellen’s notion look occas
 remov balanc-of-risk assess statement earliest opportun.
 clear do; think hinder commun now. also agre
 regard presid pool’s memo. unavoid, commun market.
 expect devis formula languag go last beyond coupl meet
 optimist score, think.
 also want note idea exit strategi agre it’s pretti hard
 envis statement accompani rate chang would also induc market believ
 we’re sure increas rate next meet. don’t care much shape yield
 curv six month out, would prefer rais rate first meet
 second. so, think put fine point doesn’t make sens.
 now, said that, get point paus, think it’s go
 import drain sensit yield curv. want convinc market
 think we’re go done sever quarter coupl year. want
 maintain market sensit incom data—to believ might move ¼ point
 either wai fund rate. i’ve tri avoid us term “neutral”

 so, again, support what’s tabl.

 me, that’s would happen got rid line 5 6 entir. so, think need
