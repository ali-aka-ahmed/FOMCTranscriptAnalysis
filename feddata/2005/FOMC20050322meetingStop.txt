 occurred even though real GDP growth expected fed funds rate
 increased. inflation could increase much last year presence sizable slack rising

 addition, number indicators suggest continuing inflationary pressures. example,

 also seeing evidence increased pricing power Tenth District, firms
 confidence ability raise output prices even without increase input costs.

 final reason see upside risk inflation monetary policy does, fact, remain

 Greenbook’s assumptions tighter policy, fed funds rate end year

 called mid-cycle sweet spot, obvious question is: happened
 since then? would say that, general, headline bifurcated. One is, “so far good;”
 two is, “there number caveats”.
 Let’s first look “so far good” part headline. already
 pointed out, economy seems gaining momentum. Households continue good
 shape. saving rate is, unfortunately, low, supporting consumption. Households
 also supported increase compensation per hour continues look quite robust.
 Greenbook pointed out, seems pothole investment side,
 business fixed investment component also kicking in. Nevertheless, number

 caveats seem important? deal

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions Vincent?
 MR. GRAMLICH. Let ask last sentences. said use

 MR. REINHART. can’t use signal direction rates. stands

 other. So, question is: news put clause paragraph? guess I’d argue
 really isn’t, could tightening six times risk assessment
 balanced, unless implicitly conditioned appropriate policy. suggestion
 Bluebook make conditioning explicit because, particular point, would emphasize
 takes work keep risks balanced. want flag go
 direction, point along road going happy statement.
 MS. MINEHAN. similar concerns Governor Gramlich’s “appropriate
 policy action” language. given length discourse, Vincent, certainly
 interesting supporting language, level detail went describing it,
 think it’s going hard explain others heck we’re talking here. really
 think “appropriate policy action” saying job. We’ve dealt situations
 we’ve moved policy continued say risks balanced.
 “accommodative” language, think could continue say risks balanced
 whole statement would still flow logically.
 I’m also concerned alternative B rise energy prices notably feeding
 core consumer prices. Core consumer prices full percentage point yearover-year basis, feed-through. think it’s going slacken, maybe
 want put reference future, I’m sure want say
 statement. think we’d better leaving sentence going “pressures
 inflation picked recent months pricing power evident.”
 MR. REINHART. think put later statement say
 underlying inflation expected contained, seemed necessary provide least
 offset concern expressed earlier pressure inflation picked up.
 
 March 22, 2005
 
 77 116
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. critical word “notably”—that rise energy prices
 notably fed core consumer prices. It’s saying pass-through zero.
 MS. MINEHAN. doubling rate core inflation year-over-year basis—
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. actually trace cost structure, energy prices
 impact core prices two ways—in unit labor costs petrochemical feedstock prices
 spreading various constituent elements production processes affects. latter
 actually small part GDP.
 MS. MINEHAN. guess point wouldn’t make particular statement. think
 pressures inflation picked pricing power evident. all,
 believe underlying inflation contained else we’d moving lot strongly now.
 So, don’t think it’s inconsistent stop sentence—
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, there’s another reason it’s there. fact
 need put something like statement today current energy price
 environment. marginal statement impact energy prices GDP, it’s
 going raise question: cave operating?
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, worried that, too.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Mike next.
 MR. MOSKOW. wanted express concern phrase “appropriate policy action,”
 too, reasons discussed here. don’t think need it. realize

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would you—
 MR. MOSKOW. would drop it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would say: “The Committee perceives upside

 MR. MOSKOW. would say “remain roughly equal.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s tough one. We’ve gotten away wording
 we’ve raised funds rate, grounds removing accommodation.
 real significant impact. terms statement true, truth matter
 continue move up, it’s less credible. happen think makes good deal sense put
 phrase there, believe Ned Gramlich says quite correct. We’re going able
 use probably want to.
 Basically, inherent contradiction saying risks balanced we’re
 tightening. Now, say we’re tightening we’re removing accommodation,
 long. think we’re getting point problem
 language. We’ve gotten away it, don’t think we’re going get away much
 longer. particular phrase put is, judgment, way work way that.
 I’m sure long use it.
 MR. MOSKOW. We’d recognize it’s short-lived.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh, absolutely.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Could make friendly amendment, President Moskow?

 out, ability forecast we’re going May 3 terrific. President
 Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I’m sure followed alternatives, let weigh
 draft language cell B5 well. we’re going make kind change
 language, think there’s better way better transition terms guidance
 offer. would suggest another alternative—I guess it’s fifth alternative table—using
 words like “Conditional upon current path policy, risks attainment
 sustainable growth price stability roughly balanced.” couple things: seems
 linked path policy heard us around table say comfortable
 with; gets around problem Bill Poole talked terms inability find
 words describe distribution risk. think something like better transitional
 paragraph.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Try again. bad idea.
 MR. GUYNN. “Conditional upon current path policy, risks attainment
 sustainable growth price stability roughly balanced.” combines number
 things heard around table. Also, want say come cave Cathy
 B4 cell. Although didn’t quid pro quo voted early release minutes,
 one effects lot us hoped could simplify statement. seems

 flesh risk well others we’ve talked about. it’s great opportunity
 simplify statement little.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. think there’s disadvantage validating market’s
 current expectations explicitly. two ways think framing policy assumption
 giving signal. One say, “with policy unchanged, et cetera.” say, “taking
 expected path priced markets, think X.” That’s approach number central
 banks taken.
 doesn’t make sense make significant change basic signal time;
 think there’s lot risk validation explicit. view, there’s actually lot virtue
 combination changes statement, condition qualify “measured”
 without taking word out. it’s move direction giving us flexibility without
 claiming think there’s abrupt change balance risks. Vincent said,
 fall back making explicit implicit—which risks balanced
 commit right thing. don’t believe we’re going right thing, …
 MR. GUYNN. May try one thought? meant say earlier. think Jerry
 Jordan, wherever sailboat, would smile B5, think we’re saying exactly
 Jerry tried get us years say: policy set appropriately meeting, risks
 always balanced. think actually neuters entire balance-of-risk statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May suggest something? think you’re addressing issue

 Roger indicated, degrees volatility respect future. Indeed,
 Vincent also showed markets adjusting Federal Reserve policy way cannot
 continue. words, don’t omniscience able look sufficiently far
 continue trying do—and able successfully
 right expect. So, think little careful this. Quickly,
 colleagues want speak this.
 SPEAKER (?). one concern “measured,” means 25 basis
 points.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. not. hope minutes—
 I’m going say something it—we try take away notion “measured”
 means 25 basis points. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. thing concerns sentence we’ve
 working this: I’m sure actually anything good. were, mind, may
 better we’re going. I’m sure “should” means context, I’m sure
 conditioning actually moves us ahead. may better staying wording
 February statement, ambiguous policy action doesn’t talk normative
 statements like “should.” benefit moving us wrong direction,
 address want May.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One possibility—I’m necessarily arguing this—is
 instead “appropriate policy” say “with current policy actions.” think
 discussion May meeting. reason say arguments essentially

 MR. SANTOMERO. It’s shift all.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, problem don’t shift—if retain

 President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. There’s something highly ironic whole discussion me.
 initially introduced balance-of-risk statement order communicate direction
 policy without talking explicitly interest rates policy. relying sort
 simple version policy rule whereby public could generally decode talking
 about. 2003 hit problem rising real growth falling inflation,
 needed disentangle two different parts. that, trumped another
 statement widely seen conveying real information direction policy.
 balance risks seen communicating direction economy and, ironically,
 we’re putting “policy” balance-of-risk statement order clarify meaning
 economy.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let ask one thing discussion. draft
 language Bluebook originally. haven’t communicated concerns?
 That’s precisely purpose Bluebook.
 MR. GUYNN. have.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. convey you, Vincent?
 MR. REINHART. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, obviously didn’t convince him. [Laughter]
 
 March 22, 2005

 MR. LACKER. Mr. Chairman, going say
 minutes convey rich format view likely direction economy

 don’t view whether May right time change language—because
 we’re placing weight balance-of-risk statement.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don’t handle replicating part argument

 [Laughter]
 MR. LACKER. ultimate place going suggest sometime soon

 MR. LACKER. hope decision. balance-of-risk assessment, don’t

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. valid issue put table. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. It’s important, we’ve said before, minutes true transcript,
 it’s also important statement true whole process. don’t want say
 something that’s going misleading. think minutes need convey difficulty
 Committee coming alternative wording misleading market,
 that’s reason leaving statement is. minutes try give full
 explanation.
 Around table there’s probably majority—I didn’t count I’ll make guess—
 believe inflation risks tilted upside whatever point forecast is.
 
 March 22, 2005
 
 85 116
 
 least that’s way I’d put it. believe probably majority sentiment. So, strictly
 speaking, saying risks balanced isn’t accurate reflection views around table.

 minutes need explain carefully difficulty Committee wording

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Right, we’re keeping moment

 MR. POOLE. think that’s practical alternative point.

 talk taking away balance-of-risk language. don’t think it’s serving us well anymore.

 we’re going see real long-term rates real mortgage rates begin move capital

 Remember, 15 20 percent personal consumption expenditures relate income;
 consequence, least econometrically, wealth effect. Therefore, significant

 Real long-term rates may go up. It’s hard forecast, looking long-term fiscal

 judgment, median forecast United States reasonably well captured

 didn’t like alternative C language, though think ultimately could useful.
 worry somewhat President Minehan’s proposal remove balance-of-risk

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bernanke.

 we’ve essentially put nail coffin original version statement. decidedly

 everyone always knew. [Laughter]
 Let comment alternative C. We’re evolving economy
 communicating public, expect certain reactions expect us
 policy evolve react certain way. Alternative C zero probability event, I’m quite

 I’ve never fan balance-of-risk statement. know number

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. support recommendation move 25 basis points,
 support alternative B described here. Actually, think it’s pretty good statement,
 considering alternatives. [Laughter] two important things conveys evolution
 signal two respects. acknowledges change outlook important dimensions,
 conveys qualification conditions serenity way introduces
 uncertainty. think it’s also desirable nice, relatively delicate way, believe
 it’s pretty good outcome—again, relative alternatives.

 It’s less clear going make sense next meeting. Obviously, we’re
 probably going want look broader range changes statement, don’t know

 comfortable less dramatic evolution may implied statement.
 Let make one comment minutes. There’s risk minutes, look
 like transcript, would suggest map, thin consensus regarding
 anything craft signal monetary policy. would justice
 Committee discussion. think minutes would best designed—I know can’t
 massage ex ante—if acknowledge reality want take look number
 different dimensions signal convene May convey
 motivation wanting look that. think done without going far suggest
 views map we’re fundamentally uncomfortable.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. inherent contradiction minutes

 MS. MINEHAN. Presumably, we’d address much minutes; leave
 transcript released five years now.
 I’m agreement 25 basis points. said before, go along keeping
 alternative B way is. concerns it, I’m alone, think we’ve spent
 enough time that.
 want address, however, issue raised balance-of-risk
 statement, preparatory May discussion. think look time period

 So, say policy action it, think enough forward
 content it. one looks statements late 1990s, got balance-of-risk
 assessment, enough forward-looking content them. could add subtract that,

 sentences we’d mix match order come something that, individually,
 feel comfortable with.
 view need think communication outside world broad
 range things. testimony; speeches; earlier release minutes;

 communicate. announcement meeting doesn’t everything one place.
 since it’s coming timely way, think it’s better make short give little
 bit forward context. I’d say much needed tell took action
 leave that. would best approach—unless it’s absolutely necessary,
 last year half more, say something that’s forward-looking.

 Committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent increasing

 B modified is: “The Committee perceives that, appropriate monetary policy

 believes policy accommodation removed pace likely measured.
 Nonetheless, Committee respond changes economic prospects needed fulfill
