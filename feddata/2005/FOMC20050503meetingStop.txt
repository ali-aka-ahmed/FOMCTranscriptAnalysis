 Obviously, relevant questions point are: explanations

 One plausible hypothesis experienced largely

 claims unemployment insurance averaged 325,000 past

 Moreover, despite last month=s weak retail sales report, home sales remained strong,

 sector, anecdotal reports contacts generally remained favorable
 respect order books capital spending plans.
 considerations made us comfortable discounting significantly recent
 weakness data. didn’t think prudent dismiss weakness
 entirely, either. simply much bad news. addition,
 corroboration downbeat statistical readings sources.
 poor performance retail sales coincided sag measures consumer
 sentiment past months. Likewise, reports purchasing
 managers consistent slower growth manufacturing activity
 appears occurred since turn year.
 second plausible explanation run-up energy prices taking
 greater toll activity anticipated. price gasoline soared

 futures prices oil, may growing realization ramp-up gasoline
 prices likely prove persistent drain purchasing power. That, turn, may
 leading consumers trim spending areas. evidence
 households may viewing recent increases gasoline prices likely

 Despite continued expansion global activity, long-term sovereign interest rates

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. David, referred remarks exercise
 shown package materials Monday’s Board briefing. I’m looking pass-through
 core inflation rise energy prices, import prices, commodity prices. back
 December ’03, baseline exercise, forecast energy prices,
 commodity prices, import prices, dollar consistent happened, would
 expected model show much pass-through core inflation prices? would
 result surprising?
 MR. STOCKTON. result exercise suggests, anything, little surprise
 didn’t get touch pass-through. Actually, surprised first saw results
 sat back thought carefully. Certainly, told late 2003, oil
 prices $25 $28 barrel, going something north $50, markets
 would perceive largely permanent change, would see ongoing
 depreciation dollar significant acceleration intermediate materials prices, think
 would said core consumer price inflation 1¾ percent would pretty good
 outcome. So, thought it, comfortable results presented
 yesterday.
 Now, indicated Greenbook alternative simulation,
 comfortable inflation forecast, could certainly understand less comfortable
 assessment pass-through core inflation, given area
 made persistent errors. It’s hard estimate pass-through effects. know work
 done years Board Reserve Bank staff aimed trying estimate indirect
 energy price effects import price effects. Sometimes coefficients zero sometimes
 large. looks us if, recently, size coefficients diminished,

 could simply function fact many variables relatively stable long
 period time. It’s hard estimate precisely effects are. alternative
 simulation, doubled size pass-through effects, intended give sense
 far things could get line made rather big error size pass-through.
 And, noted, would noticeable effect going forward. So, seem
 reasonable wonder whether underlying forecast right oil, imports,
 commodities also whether pass-through correct.

 Higher energy costs also reduced growth countries, think probably

 Obviously, need little time information determine whether recent

 temporary, then, energy prices level perhaps decline somewhat, would expect

 MR. FERGUSON. Thank much, Mr. Chairman. Like everyone else, I’ve noted
 concern incoming evidence soft patch respect growth rough
 patch respect inflation. However, also believe Greenbook taken incoming
 data board usual wisdom aplomb would expect staff. I, therefore,
 think easily support baseline reasonable basis policymaking today.
 said that, I’m also quite certain baseline wrong; don’t know
 direction. many already pointed out, range risks really quite large. would
 say one looks alternative simulations, one see many elements risks.
 Given fact I’m last speaker, go recitation data. Instead, I’m
 going move implications that.
 First, think outcome today’s meeting sense foregone conclusion.
 Anything move 25 basis points would folly, don’t think want go
 path. Second, respect say today, number people raised
 questions whether keep word “measured” description. Frankly,
 given range uncertainties facing now, anything say policy
 moved measured pace, think, would create uncertainty certainty. inertia
 terms language might well smart move.
 Thinking beyond that, though, rest year focusing bit strategy,
 note markets marked expectation fed funds rate

 percent. leads think exactly driving unusual data seen

 Many already explored energy price issue implications inflation. Let
 go side, question whether tightening monetary policy

 think statement actually good job pointing slowing solid pace
 spending growth one hand inflation pressures also picked up. So, think
 balance good.
 Going forward, would say I, too, would like get forward-looking
 statements possibly can. I’d like shorter statement near future. I’d like drop
 balance-of-risk statement, don’t think adds anything now. agree outlived
 usefulness, Governor Ferguson said. don’t think time it.
 think chances statement really require major changes June
 meeting. don’t know going point; depend data, course.
 think require major changes, that’s probably time look this.
 Now, going respond Governor Olson’s unfair comment
 Chicago Bulls except say see Washington Wizards lose
 home court advantage next game face Chicago Bulls friendly confines
 United Center. [Laughter]
 MR. OLSON. Let point isn’t communicate
 do. [Laughter]
 MR. MOSKOW. Touché.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. end your—[laughter]?
 MR. MOSKOW. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support, course, proposal raise
 federal funds rate 25 basis points, think strategy suggest respect
 language alternative B also merit today. seems advantageous point make
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 94 116
 
 minimal changes statement, alternative B does. think market expectations essentially
 entirely sensible, make sense today great deal perturb expectations.
 think policy path we’re on, put it, likely positive slope. I’m comfortable
 term “measured pace” think continues indicate whether call policy
 accommodative somewhat accommodative, likely direction federal funds rate up,
 think ought communicating that. believe retain considerable flexibility pause
 aggressive. see that, pointed out, Mr. Chairman, futures path
 market responds news.
 So, think flexibility. agree Governor Ferguson need exit
 strategy exit strategy, proposal get rid balance-of-risk statement.
 Maybe today right day it, part ultimate exit strategy, may well
 need next meeting, would love see go. feel need communicate
 something future, view crafting simple English sentence two describe
 consensus Committee way it. balance-of-risk statement attempt
 give hints future path policy without saying anything funds rate directly
 instead determinants policy. don’t think that’s possible.
 read President Poole’s memo understand desirability standard language,
 Committee hasn’t obtained consensus determinants policy. don’t
 common definition maximum employment price stability. don’t common
 view importance forecasts agreement relative values gaps versus growth rates
 making forecasts. Without kind consensus, can’t come formulaic
 assessment balance risks. might work couple meetings, we’re going
 get situation fail, that’s feel today.
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 95 116
 
 So, going forward, may time change language pause
 longer feel certain direction policy is. Maybe time simple statement says
 something like sensible way go: “Under current conditions, policy seems well
 positioned achieve dual goals respond, needed, fulfill obligations
 foster price stability sustainable economic growth.”
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson.
 MR. OLSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First all, support ¼ point increase
 funds rate language alternative B. read alternative B, think
 communicates want communicate. says pace spending growth slowed
 repeats concern inflation. say get paragraphs 5
 6, also opinion starting get little shopworn need think
 want communicate assessment risk.
 said that, think views significant way impacted recollection
 summer 2003 where, course three meetings, three different vehicles
 communication, variations communication, third one confused markets.
 thought specifically clear articulation policy.
 reminds ought deliberate terms change
 communication.
 think we’ve done markets great favor accelerating release minutes.
 earlier release minutes allows us go back look type statement
 release immediately meeting. would suggest look issue context;
 may allow us alter method communicate day meeting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support proposal, ¼ point increase
 funds rate alternative B language. think measured pace increase funds rate
 still best guess we’ll do. heard one two people around table say
 might closer pause thought, owing recent data, one two people
 around table say might accelerate pace they’re putting
 emphasis incoming inflation data. think broad center Committee still
 measured pace increases and, therefore, broad center Committee believes—I
 think—that ought tell market still think rates low rise.
 tell without telling something removing accommodation measured
 pace, think we’ll conveying uncertainty intentions would helpful.
 view, would helpful remove language point.
 agree balance-of-risk statement right broken either meaningless or,
 it’s meaningful, it’s rather distorted. think it’s going very, hard remove without
 sending signal think might behind curve one sense another, don’t
 think are, don’t think want send signal. So, guess lines 5 6
 going reworked, point think we’re near pause point,
 don’t think that’s going June, President Moskow. I’d surprised were. think
 it’s going hard rework sentences think we’re close finished
 tightening process. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. support 25 basis points alternative B. agree
 soften statement meeting. fact, read alternative B, interpreted
 tightening somewhat removing statement energy prices fed notably
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 97 116
 
 core consumer prices. anything, leaning toward tighter statement, think
 alternative B would serve us well right now.
 want endorse President Yellen’s notion look occasion
 remove balance-of-risk assessment statement earliest opportunity.
 clear doing; think hindering communication now. also agree
 regard President Poole’s memo. Unavoidably, communicating markets.
 expect devising formulaic language going last beyond couple meetings
 optimistic score, think.
 also want note idea exit strategy agree it’s pretty hard
 envision statement accompany rate change would also induce markets believe
 we’re sure increase rates next meeting. don’t care much shape yield
 curve six months out, would prefer raising rates first meeting
 second. So, think putting fine point doesn’t make sense.
 Now, said that, get point pause, think it’s going
 important drain sensitivity yield curve. want convince markets
 think we’re going done several quarters couple years. want
 maintain markets sensitivity incoming data—to believe might move ¼ point
 either way funds rate. I’ve tried avoid using term “neutral”
 characterize rate stop moving, approaches suppose.
 So, again, support what’s table.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also support recommendation 25
 basis point increase fed funds rate target, also take guidance language.
 
 May 3, 2005

 said earlier, though, preference expressing uncertainty
 outlook inflation also timing magnitude future moves. given said
 earlier, support recommendation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gramlich.
 MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, support recommendation
 move funds rate 25 basis points use language alternative B. remarks,
 made noise combining elements alternative A; I’m going press that.
 Based discussion, think I’ve lost debate. hour getting late, I’m fine
 B.
 minutes, think I’m Roger don’t really see problem. issue
 fairly terse statement. Subsequently, minutes come give lot color. minutes
 indicate people felt people felt that. said; it’s faithfully
 transcribed. think fills blanks. So, don’t really see problem is.
 actually think it’s great assist us minutes coming three-week lag.
 think that’s going one better things we’ve ever done, though must say lot us
 reservations time.
 process issue, one thing we’ve learned can’t make major rhetorical changes
 meeting. statements read probably eight times figure nooks
 crannies them. get statement circulated meeting, late assess
 nuances. We’re tired, we’re thinking wording perspectives. So, don’t
 think good idea.
 Let suggest one thing might consider. actually think format
 developed—where get alternatives A, B, C chance study them—works pretty
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 99 116
 
 well. think domain options gotten rather narrow. Look differences
 B. line 1, there’s “further” alternative line 2, there’s “somewhat.”
 line 3, alternative B “somewhat” line 4, there’s “while.” line 5 word “action”
 gone alternative A. [Laughter] pretty small potatoes, think, compared
 people talking about. So, one thing might consider little extra material
 Bluebook every then—maybe January June meetings maybe critical
 time we’re going change strategy—that gives broader range options. staff
 could provide draft statement without bank sentences minor variations—just look
 little bigger way. way we’d still get chance study wouldn’t getting
 statement late meeting.
 last thing want say totally agree Janet line 5 ought go. I’ve
 two committees tried fix up, couldn’t it. one point sent
 memos around tried own. didn’t work either. don’t think fix it.
 think that’s started sentence 6 de novo. specific problem,
 worked language deal it. I’m saying “we,” fact that. think sentence
 6 worked much better 5. So, point sentence 5 ought go. Let’s try come
 terse language gives full dimension 6. would suggestion.
 Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, think ¼ point increase funds rate
 target appropriate, language alternative B fine today. don’t think it’s
 essential make major changes language moment, it’s probably good
 idea.
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 100 116
 
 agree President Yellen others balance-of-risk statements
 probably jettisoned earliest opportunity. would also say think value
 providing forward-looking guidance markets. generally, among things,
 helps assure certain consistency policy, think value well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support recommendation raise rates 25 basis
 points, I’ll support alternative B. Governors know, I’ve frustrated whole
 “assessment risk” piece this, yesterday, thinking it, realized isn’t
 simple craft alternatives. One things I’m struck sentences 3 4
 really meat release time. tell we’re looking real economy
 inflation, two major mandates. didn’t something tying
 together—to convey conclusion risks—that would leave markets hanging.
 me, that’s would happen got rid lines 5 6 entirely. So, think need
 something anchor that. first leaning toward alternative C, line 6, thinking would
 it. read it, thought: references fostering attainment sustainable
 economic growth price stability like motherhood apple pie. Obviously,
 Fed supposed do. So, really saying anything? could sentence
 matter what—if rate inflation 12 percent unemployment 3½ percent.
 question is: need there? think need something beyond rationale
 decision today. Right now, think sentence 2 important says get
 noise data, underlying still accommodative. sets notion
 longer-run horizon beyond next meeting.
 
 May 3, 2005
 
 101 116
 
 So, look replace this, it’s almost longer-run horizon important point.
 Maybe, President Yellen said, gets back way set goals targets overall.
 need longer-run anchor, need short-run signal market. don’t think
 eliminate risk assessment. say something, especially times
 risks sides.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. think makes sense us raise funds rate 25
 basis points, support alternative B. Fortunately, don’t need decide today whether
 statement going make sense current structure June August October.
 make decision times. thing need decide today whether want
 alter significantly expectations priced markets future path fed funds rate.
 agree number said—that there’s compelling case so.
 second thing one say need decide whether want introduce
 uncertainty greater dispersion around set expectations exists. Again, don’t think
 there’s compelling case us try conscious act signaling today. think
 alternative B actually pretty good signal today, don’t actually know going
 make sense June structure statement going forward.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. think consensus 25 basis points
 wording alternative B. Would read appropriate language?
 MS. DANKER. I’ll reading page 28 Bluebook language alternative B:
 “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price
 stability promote sustainable growth output. long-run objectives,
 Committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent increasing

 federal funds rate average around 3 percent.” “The Committee perceives that,
 appropriate monetary policy action, upside downside risks attainment
 sustainable growth price stability kept roughly equal. underlying inflation
 expected contained, Committee believes policy accommodation removed
 pace likely measured. Nonetheless, Committee respond changes economic
 prospects needed fulfill obligation maintain price stability.”
