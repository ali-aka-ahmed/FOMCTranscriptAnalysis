 Inflation slowed last couple months, I’ve focused bit nature

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.
 MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like others, somewhat, though fully,
 reassured incoming data. economy clearly appears expansionary track,
 seriously damaged seriously damaging hurricanes. Additionally, readings
 core inflation surprisingly benign, given everything know models
 anecdotal data we’ve heard others cumulative effect rise energy prices.
 importantly, intermeeting period, inflation expectations next five years
 5- 10-year horizons little changed. least changed much since last
 meeting could reasonably described, time, contained.

 earlier dialogue Vincent Chairman indicated, ask staff give
 information inflation expectations energy prices interact. Let summarize
 three points data. First, categories energy prices—spot crude, gasoline,
 far futures, natural gas, heating oil—it seems spot crude one drives inflation
 expectations firmly. Second, Vincent indicated, across 2-year, 5-year, 10-year
 horizons inflation expectations, 2-year horizon really one heavily
 influenced spot crude oil prices. third, think Vincent said, even impact
 inflation expectations spot crude 2-year horizon relatively muted: 1 percent increase
 spot crude oil prices, least models, tends go 0.7 basis point increase inflation
 expectations. we’re aware importance energy prices, turns terms
 driving inflation expectations, many things equally important.
 said that, let turn broader issues import meeting,

 said that, think number forces pulling pushing economy

 certainly agree him—that impact hurricanes likely
 supply side demand side. However, would say that’s partial equilibrium
 analysis. ceteris clearly paribus case, number forces
 also driving demand side independently hurricanes. Let highlight two three
 them. One continue worried mystery that’s driving businesses.
 Dave raised opening remarks point I’ve made times—that investment/GDP ratio
 still seems relatively low, certainly compared level last decade. survey
 evidence CEOs CFOs still uncertainty. Anecdotal discussions
 others suggest uncertainty whether invest
 United States overseas. second part uncertainty still, think, lingering concern
 elevated energy prices eventually play lower demand.
 others may disagree, think large negative net equity issuance willingness

 ample liquidity, primarily sign businesses somewhat skeptical ability
 reward shareholders reasonable future return internal investment. And, therefore,
 may holding back investment. I’d also say slightly negative guidance businesses
 earnings season reinforces view there’s downward pressure shows
 slightly lower equilibrium rate would otherwise.
 Second, would pick point Kohn Sue Bies made
 developments housing sector, households particular sudden fall-off
 demand HELOCs [home equity lines credit]. Again, think creates little bit
 downward pressure neutral rate.
 may also see next couple years increase saving rate,
 reasons staff talked also due continuing uncertainty pensions,
 surely much newspapers. think that, plus ongoing discussions Social
 Security reform, perhaps drive households save more.
 finally, pick Karen’s point—a point haven’t talked much today—I
 think net exports forecast horizon likely, anything, continue drag,

 bringing nominal funds rate 4 percent would place real funds rate

 First, might believe staff underestimating vigor aggregate
