 point increas fed fund rate target. also accept languag altern b. like
 other, though, came meet prefer remov word “measur.” didn’t see
 remov term “measur” wai brian did—that meant market might think would go
 faster pace 50 basi point. thought remov would give us flexibl stop
 certain point. it’s interest, listen convers todai, differ
 interpret would mean. go go guidanc. nevertheless,
 given know todai, i’m lean view we’re go stop point soon
 versu concern we’re go more. again, given i’ve heard todai

 chairman greenspan. presid yellen.
 ms. yellen. thank you, mr. chairman. support 25 basi point increas todai
 also support languag altern b. seem framework “b” maintain

 conclud mind least two step, mayb more. potenti remov
 “accommod” mai signal intend go beyond neutral restrict stanc.
 it’s realli hard interpret market go react thi. frankli, think
 statement come close get would like see todai,
 essenti valid expect current market greenbook.
 expect highli like almost certain move anoth 25 basi point next time
 march beyond open question. think statement
 like bring long-term rate down, although see shortli.
 issu asset price, would simpli second comment governor kohn made

 see other’s idea. again, frustrat i’m sure wa, found construct.
 there’s lot like altern b, support well. i’ll limit comment
 word plai. actual, comment draft statement languag last week indic
 support leav “polici accommod” in. think wa—and still believ thi—that
 realli haven’t move whatev neutral point pure tighten. littl bit
 concern market interpret wai assum we’ve gotten behind and, therefor,
 ratchet thing up. like brian’s comment come time honor discharg

 word phrase servic. sinc it’s hard measur, even difficult talk
 about, think time get statement.
 actual think there’s cost leav “measur” row 4. although think
 probabl small remov misinterpret opportun us move faster,
 it’s much better leav in. strong prefer leav next line is, “is
 like” instead “mai.” think that’s ar, i’d much prefer word stai
 wai. assum we’re go substanti chang statement come month.
 hope find wai either meet meet chanc share
 view see other’s idea, messi is. think come better place
 that. thank you, mr. chairman.

 basi point support languag altern b. think it’s nice, balanc formul,
 believ it’s best wai leav expect roughli neutral.
 think view probabl high we’re go need move januari
 march mayb even bet. seem right. probabl introduc littl bit
 uncertainti signal monetari polici case befor, think that’s
 desir. it’s fairli flexibl formul allow us adapt reason easili go forward.
 agre “mai” would carri much risk take good deal tighten
 built market, and, therefor, don’t think would desir.
 problem “measur,” cours, discuss much dispers
 interpret implic “measur” todai it’s littl hard justifi retain it.
 nevertheless, i’m comfort retain two virtu necessarili

 inconsist. on keep bit cap expect much fast
 need move, think that’s probabl desir now. second implic carri sens

 so, balanc, make sens keep it.
 also, want echo mani said agre pretti good
