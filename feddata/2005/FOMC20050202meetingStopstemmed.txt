 question target, everybodi seem 1 percent bottom,
 that’s fine. am, too; there’s littl disagr that. think

 go set rang unemploy?” staff dealt issu document found
 actual risk make fundament macroeconom mistak. so, would want

 mr. ferguson. thank you, mr. chairman. start, i’ve told you, i’m struck
 easili on move committe brash “young turk” part
 “old guard.” so, former young turk member old guard, speak

 you’ve rais number question, other too. first on, obvious, is:
 on believ core mission price stabil? definit, take easi answer “ye.”
 would note we’ve gone around tabl and, other point out,
 on who, mani year experi, would sai anyth “ye.” that’s
 extraordinarili import, on reason peopl get excit question
 inflat target—or redefin staff adopt quantit price

 sit whichev chair room, experi we’ve past 20-plu year
 creat committe strong sens price stabil kei element respons.
 that, think, bedrock shouldn’t ignor.
 
 februari 1-2, 2005
 
 48 177
 
 let turn question put tabl. first,
 on defin price stabil? staff done veri, good job mani wai, think
 thei’ve given us littl fals dilemma defin price stabil. actual try defin
 wai—both qualit quantit. qualit definit is: doesn’t seem
 affect wai household behav. put definit tabl, mr. chairman,
 think irrelev us. second, like everyon els, i’ve learn time i’ve
 perhap core pce stage better index, that’s sai five year
 won’t go offici chain cpi mai becom better index. so, stage, core
 pce seem slightli better term on think inflat.
 object term rate inflat? think argument pretti
 clear. point estim versu rang, think janet, alwai, background, note

 experi—i end ned gramlich wa, believ it’s probabl wiser think
 rang. now, said that, get staff’s point announc rang
 zone indiffer, sens there’s question ad public
 alreadi know.
 bring third point, is: need have, addit intern
 discuss, broad extern discuss? start gari stern start end
 differ place. gari ask question, sens, “is broken?” answer is, “no, it’s
 broken.” think observ committe would recogn bottom end rang
 1 percent we’ve clear it. believ mani would sai thei’re sure
 upper end it’s probabl 2 2½ percent area. listen
 discuss, think is, fact, far off. so, term anchor expect
 commun view, somehow anoth we’ve manag that, broadli speak. so,
 don’t think need push element.
 
 februari 1-2, 2005

 now, let proce question announc target. i’ve notic number
 peopl think we’d want announc somehow soft price object. i,
 role member old guard would rais number cautionari question believ
 consid point—if todai, mayb later. first, proce
 announc committe defin price stabil on, let’s sai, core pce tight rang, i’d
 view begin soft inflat target regim. believ would unwis
 us think stop there. believ would begin slipperi slope.
 would number question we’d answer, go forward, haven’t heard fulli
 flesh todai, though come up. let put forward.
 on, obvious, numer object maximum sustain growth. think
 actual room right soft view believ potenti is. i’m sure
 we’ll agre number year now. quit cautiou give
 estim potenti—give soft rang—know uncertainti involv
 measur maximum sustain growth and, therefor, measur output gap. we’ve also
 learn work athanasio orphanid danger could try us real-time
 estim output gap guid toward inflat toward policymak. there’s anoth
 reason we’ve littl cautiou regard. decid want
 announc even gener quantit target inflat quantit rang—i prefer us
 word “target”—i think would forc explain view inflat

 i’d sai thing unemploy. ye, number reason vincent
 talk would explain would unwis us try explicit
 consid full employ. hand, concept nairu [non­
 acceler inflat rate unemploy] much there. peopl room
 who, period sinc i’ve here, swore nairu 5.6 percent. peopl, two
 month later, also would sworn 5.4 percent. so, think evid suggest
 
 februari 1-2, 2005
 
 50 177
 
 we’re go try quantifi on element mandat, we’ve got veri, firm
 abil explain haven’t quantifi element.
 second question would emerg, go path quietli whisper
 numer goal object, is: go inflat outsid rang?
 think point we’d face number question. quickli go move?
 edg around rang hard soft? exactli mean sai that’s defin
 price stabil? go move aggress we’re outsid rang? give
 famou economist’s answer, “it depend.” go get third question: “why don’t
 give forecast inflat realli mean someth, oppos now?”
 well, we’d explain that.
 kohn, think, rais import issu. don’t think quietli
 without go congress administr. read inform countri
 oversea, almost everi case govern role establish inflat object.
 agre other said: soon go path, go confront
 question astut member congress.
 then, final, think question come up, “what problem?” it’s littl hard
 sai exactli problem right now. think cathi appropri point number
 us said mani time, inflat target inher bad concept;
 work well number economi. happen mai right concept
 here.
 would proudli defens statu quo. think thing

 we’ve shown us them.
 final, part old guard, let leav, consider want

 first, look overal question public kind inflat

 announc effect, itself, us extrem—whether inflat low

 hand, narrow band, there’s much higher risk fall outsid it, affect

 reason i’m uncomfort set rang object—i’m put

 2001, economi slow we’d terrorist attack, think object term
 inflat would differ from—to us exampl michael gave—a period
 inflat run 3 percent three year row unemploy sit 4½

 that’s import distinct, get dual mandat think

 worri pressur build scarciti resourc, could sai
