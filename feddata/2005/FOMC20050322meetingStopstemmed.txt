 suspect, know, mai near end process.
 look differ model, least unit state, given fiscal polici problem

 core inflat concern—the damag economi polici would great.
 obvious neg sens outcom differ on expect—but
 compar polici problem we’d run maintain postur presuppos median

 mr. kohn. thank you, mr. chairman. agre propos, agre

 i’d like make comment previou discuss. differ

 exactli on issu divid second ferguson subcommitte. wa, point,
 altern c column, tini minor that—at least, felt like tini
 minor subcommitte. we’ve around sever time. and, actual,
 didn’t like altern c languag, though think ultim could us.
 worri somewhat presid minehan’s propos remov balanc-of-risk
 languag “measur pace” languag. think someth forward-look ought remain
 statement. mayb doesn’t need formula; mayb, suggest, debat it,
 could chang time time. think it’s import market aren’t certain
 action, but, extent tell someth true we’re go
 expect thing come out, believ asset price better. don’t think
 insert uncertainti market insert uncertainti market. know
 someth sens we’re go, somehow sai wai make
 asset price reflect realiti.
 third point tradeoff quickli draft statement get
 committe—and get less written cement—and reaction goe
 meet current inform. think we’re difficult posit: soon

 march 22, 2005

 chairman greenspan. critic issu is: know someth? there’s go
 come time can’t forecast idea next polici move be.
 forward-look context is, obvious, inappropri.
 mr. kohn. right. think said that, would us inform. said
 don’t know wai rate go go next—that we’re sure depend

 mr. pool. thank you, mr. chairman. support 25 basi point increas. want

 advantag, think, push futur keep current increas

 clear respons new piec inform. almost blue go
 creat lot uncertainti, market go know make
 it’s clear respons someth new inform set. so, given
 substitut extens 25 basi point increas, seem
 work latter direct rather take market surpris. don’t know good
