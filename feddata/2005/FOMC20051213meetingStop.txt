 therefore focus attention factors affecting inflation outlook. that,
 need look first remind recent readings core prices
 consistently come expectations. signs acceleration. fact, core
 PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation slowed past year;
 recent reading 1.8 percent past twelve months 0.3 preceding year.
 downward inflation trend continued year, core PCE inflation running
 1.6 percent past six months, middle preferred range. course,
 even though recent core inflation data look pretty darn good, may forces work could
 undermine price stability. remaining remarks, I’d like comment factors could
 push inflation higher consider likely effects current situation.
 first risk price stability that, contrary Greenbook forecast, growth may
 actually subside toward potential. labor product markets could tighten further, pushing

 monetary policy would, course, need tighten. inflation consequences would modest,
 given reactive Taylor rule monetary policy response. deal risk, seems

 sustained slowdown productivity growth would pose challenging dilemma
 policy inflation outlook. Fortunately, however, productivity growth past year
 slowed. Quite contrary, surprisingly robust. Output per hour nonfarm business

 compelling reasons productivity growth may well remain elevated time,
 gradual diffusion new technologies workplace practices throughout economy.
 Therefore, concur staff’s conclusion accumulated evidence indicates structural
 productivity growth around 3 percent corresponding upward revision outlook
 actual productivity. Given sluggish adjustment wages changes productivity, stronger
 path productivity reduces rate growth unit labor costs, putting downward pressure
 inflation. productivity trends suggest tempering inflationary pressures, intensification.
 Energy prices also pose potential threat inflation. argued meetings back,
 empirical evidence support significant pass-through energy prices core inflation.
 won’t repeat arguments today simply note, again, core PCE inflation actually
 moderated, despite nearly 30 percent increase energy prices past year, top 15
 percent rise previous year. Moreover, energy prices whole come sharply
 late, and, therefore, risk significant pass-through core inflation moderated well.
 addition, appears Fed’s credibility held well year, despite supply
 shocks associated higher energy prices hurricanes. Survey measures longer-run inflation
 expectations stood storms. Longer-run inflation expectations based
 Treasury securities come ¼ percentage point since last FOMC meeting
 levels year ago.
 Finally, it’s possible wage growth could accelerate, putting upward pressure
 growth unit labor costs inflation. And, indeed, Greenbook forecast projects exactly
 acceleration, reflecting lagged pass-through earlier increases energy prices productivity

 point today’s discussion, rather like alternative B, back forth, sits

 notion. take reference accommodative policy out, think need consider
 appropriate section 4, forward-looking language. And, particular, phraseology “some
 measured policy firming likely needed” strikes getting right balance,
 think saying well. word “measured” think come mean 25 basis points,
 believe it’s important hold notion take “accommodative.”
 Secondly, issue much do, tend think may one two
 moves, similar expectation built Greenbook market, strikes
 appropriate supporting concept “some further.” So, even though it’s mouthful, like
 “some measured policy firming.”
 “may” versus “is likely,” think it’s important hold “is likely” that’s
 actually best judgment—that tightening likely. get January much

 accept wording alternative B now.
 Mr. Chairman, talked risks long-term side market. think
 serious concern much pricing days seems involve looking
 longer-term risks, it’s critical currently driving investment risk-taking.
 reason, guess I’d like leave words now. big change would like
 see move away forward-looking language get point

 removing term “measured” way Brian did—that meant markets might think would go

 certain point. It’s interesting, listening conversation today, different
 interpretations would mean. going go guidance. Nevertheless,
 given know today, I’m leaning view we’re going stop point soon
 versus concern we’re going more. again, given I’ve heard today
 given recommendation, support language written alternative B.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support 25 basis point increase today

 process, much surprise, way 19 people taken turns drafting statement
 evolved really quite nicely. statement potential evolve next month
 March; we’ve already discussed ways evolve—by eliminating “some,” changing “is

 today, guess I’m comfortable keeping “measured.” think arguments

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation 25 basis point increase.
 I’m sure process went revising language statement frustrating
 staff actually found interesting constructive. we’re making changes
 significant today, think way us contribute ideas
 see other’s ideas. again, frustrating I’m sure was, found constructive.
 There’s lot like alternative B, support well. I’ll limit comments
 words play. Actually, comments draft statement language last week indicated
 support leaving “policy accommodation” in. thinking was—and still believe this—that
 really haven’t moved whatever neutral point pure tightening. little bit
 concern markets interpret way assume we’ve gotten behind and, therefore,
 ratcheting things up. like Brian’s comment comes time honorably discharge
 
 December 13, 2005
 
 88 100
 
 words phrases service. since it’s hard measure, even difficult talk
 about, think time get statement.
 actually think there’s cost leaving “measured” row 4. Although think
 probability small removal misinterpreted opportunity us move faster,
 it’s much better leave in. strong preference leaving next line is, “is
 likely” instead “may.” think that’s are, I’d much prefer wording stay
 way. assume we’re going substantial changes statement coming months.
 hope find way either meeting meeting chance share
 views see other’s ideas, messy is. think come better place
 that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation move 25
 basis points support language alternative B. think it’s nice, balanced formulation,
 believe it’s best way leave expectations roughly neutral.
 think view probability high we’re going need move January
 March maybe even bet. seems right. probably introduces little bit
 uncertainty signal monetary policy case before, think that’s
 desirable. It’s fairly flexible formulation allows us adapt reasonably easily going forward.
 agree “may” would carry much risk taking good deal tightening
 built market, and, therefore, don’t think would desirable.
 problem “measured,” course, discussion much dispersion
 interpret implication “measured” today it’s little hard justify retaining it.
 Nevertheless, I’m comfortable retaining two virtues necessarily

 inconsistent. One keep bit cap expectations much fast
 need move, think that’s probably desirable now. second implication carries sense
 may facing two moves rather one. Again, think that’s desirable now, too;
 so, balance, makes sense keep it.
 Also, want echo many said agree pretty good
