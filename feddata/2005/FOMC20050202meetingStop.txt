 second principle whether use core total measure, think

 we’re looking long-run objective, think total measure perfectly fine.
 two comments, personally, would put lot weight trying achieve consensus,
 don’t take dogmatic view measure.
 Let make couple comments personally would view innovation
 go route. First, staff pointed out, adopting explicit numerical
 objective would not, course, full-fledged inflation targeting regime form undertaken

 inflation rate best achieves dual mandate, would major step forward.
 take step—that is, establish true north compass, speak, long-run
 monetary policy—I would push steps direction short-term inflation

 second observation I’d like make think one benefit approach

 Whatever else do, think take granted. One questions would

 Now, whether it’s necessary define price stability terms specific index think
 less important broader question we’ve played years, is: dealing

 Let say thought papers whether adopt explicit price target

 Normally, start thinking kinds issues, ask broken we’re
 trying fix. ask myself: want explicit price inflation objective?
 answer “yes,” it’s I’m trying fix something. view next
 logical step less formalizing really past decade
 more—what would call trying lock past successes. that’s compelling
 rationale seriously considering taking step.
 said, I’ve already come pretty favorably it, two reservations
 give pause. Let mention them. They’ve already come up. One is: send
 wrong signal dual mandate? think Tom Hoenig already addressed suggesting
 clarify communication. Many us already address we’re
 public emphasizing significance price stability low inflation, indicating
 underlying reason commitment price stability affects economic performance.

 second concern gives bit pause is: Would inappropriately tie hands
 certain circumstances? concluded that, first all, legitimate crisis,
 wouldn’t difficulty explaining deviating whatever inflation objective
 announced. concerned deflation, don’t see conflict people

 basically points listed introductory comments staff.
 public would also expect us, except rare circumstances, take necessary action
 keep inflation within target band. inflation targeting framework,
 institutionalized, would align public expectations FOMC intentions. short, think explicit

 Ironically, also believe moving regime type would increase flexibility

 MR. LACKER. want start commending staff background papers

 question today whether FOMC adopt explicit numerical
 price-related objective and, so, how. feeling rather narrow question
 presented us today sense that, given current practice, announcing objective
 would require much change Fed policymaking. yet think it’s extraordinarily
 important step us take.
 Regarding operational issues raised memo Wilcox company, agree

 Admittedly, monetary policy, many people remarked today, working

 question arises take additional step announcing explicit long-run
 inflation objective. argument boils three things. First, agree want

 want inflation higher lower today.
 Second, announcing specific long-run objective, would giving much

 something think we’d better without.
 Third, establishing inflation objective within Committee would facilitate discussion.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. also wanted begin complimenting

 first participated Committee back 1994, believed inflation

 underlying inflation receded level many us consider optimal, though, transition

 I’d like come back point minute.
 recently reread transcript 1996 FOMC meeting Committee think
 last discussed numerical objective inflation. meeting actually considerable
 consensus among participants, including myself, 2 percent long-run objective CPI inflation.
 Since then, course, several important developments relevant choice. Back
 1996, argued inflation objective contain cushion sufficient grease wheels

 economic performance diminishes, however, productivity hence average wage growth rises.
 Doug mentioned, turns high productivity growth past decade made
 downward wage rigidity nonissue. me, shift offset experience
 low inflation abroad, certainly heightened concern relating zero
 lower bound. So, balance, taking number factors account, find still pretty
 comfortable numerical objective discussed almost decade ago.
 Instead adopting objective based CPI, would enunciate objective based
 core PCE. seems sensible given methodological advantages index
 Committee’s recent emphasis it. Taking measurement bias two indexes
 account, preference would long-run inflation objective 1½ percent core PCE

 wanted discuss couple details relating objective. First, prefer core

 Let briefly turn Vincent’s second question, concerns might

 easily one moves Committee brash “young Turk” part
 “old guard.” So, former young Turk member old guard, speak
 status quo.
 You’ve raised number questions, others too. first one, obviously, is:
 one believe core mission price stability? definition, take easy answer “yes.”
 would note we’ve gone around table and, others pointed out,
 one who, many years experience, would say anything “yes.” that’s
 extraordinarily important, one reasons people get excited question
 inflation targeting—or redefined staff adopting quantitative price
 objective—is anxiety people room “use lose” historical
 memory. firmly belief whatever may happen going forward, whoever may
 sit whichever chair room, experience we’ve past 20-plus years
 created Committee strong sense price stability key element responsibilities.
 that, think, bedrock shouldn’t ignore.
 
 February 1-2, 2005
 
 48 177
 
 let turn questions put table. First,
 one define price stability? staff done very, good job many ways, think
 they’ve given us little false dilemma define price stability. actually try define
 ways—both qualitatively quantitatively. qualitative definition is: doesn’t seem
 affecting way households behave. put definition table, Mr. Chairman,
 think irrelevant us. Second, like everyone else, I’ve learned time I’ve
 perhaps core PCE stage better index, that’s say five years
 won’t go officially chain CPI may become better index. So, stage, core
 PCE seems slightly better terms one thinks inflation.
 objective terms rate inflation? think argument pretty
 clear. point estimate versus range, think Janet, always, background, noted
 number reasons point estimate might useful. hand—again, learning
 experience—I end Ned Gramlich was, believe it’s probably wiser think
 range. Now, said that, get staff’s point announce range
 zone indifference, sense there’s question added public
 already knows.
 brings third point, is: need have, addition internal
 discussion, broad external discussion? start Gary Stern started end
 different place. Gary asked question, sense, “Is broken?” answer is, “No, it’s
 broken.” think observers Committee would recognize bottom end range
 1 percent we’ve clear it. believe many would say they’re sure
 upper end it’s probably 2 2½ percent area. listen
 discussions, think is, fact, far off. So, terms anchoring expectations
 communicating views, somehow another we’ve managed that, broadly speaking. So,
 don’t think need push element.
 
 February 1-2, 2005
 
 49 177
 
 Now, let proceed question announcing target. I’ve noticed number
 people think we’d want announce somehow soft price objective. I,
 role member old guard would raise number cautionary questions believe
 consider point—if today, maybe later. First, proceed
 announce Committee defines price stability on, let’s say, core PCE tight range, I’d
 view beginning soft inflation targeting regime. believe would unwise
 us think stop there. believe would beginning slippery slope.
 would number questions we’d answer, going forward, haven’t heard fully
 fleshed today, though come up. let put forward.
 One, obviously, numerical objective maximum sustainable growth. think
 actually room right soft view believe potential is. I’m sure
 we’ll agree number years now. quite cautious giving
 estimate potential—giving soft range—knowing uncertainties involved
 measuring maximum sustainable growth and, therefore, measuring output gap. We’ve also
 learned work Athanasios Orphanides dangerous could try use real-time
 estimates output gap guide toward inflation toward policymaking. there’s another
 reason we’ve little cautious regard. decided wanted
 announce even general quantitative target inflation quantitative range—I prefer use
 word “target”—I think would forced explain view inflation
 consistent achieving maximum economic growth.
 I’d say thing unemployment. Yes, number reasons Vincent
 talked would explain would unwise us try explicit
 consider full employment. hand, concept NAIRU [non­
 accelerating inflation rate unemployment] much there. people room
 who, period since I’ve here, swore NAIRU 5.6 percent. people, two
 months later, also would sworn 5.4 percent. So, think evidence suggests
 
 February 1-2, 2005

 we’re going try quantify one element mandate, we’ve got very, firm
 ability explain haven’t quantified elements.
 second question would emerge, go path quietly whispering
 numerical goal objective, is: going inflation outside range?
 think point we’d face number questions. quickly going move?
 edges around range hard soft? exactly mean say that’s define
 price stability? going move aggressively we’re outside range? give

 Well, we’d explain that.

 There’s something built econometric structures and, indeed, way
