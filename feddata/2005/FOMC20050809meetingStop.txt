 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. Dino, please start us off.
 MR. KOS.1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll referring charts front you.

 Despite rise yields, risk appetites credit markets remained strong

 yields move either direction, one market investors—and
 matter Desk—tend watch closely, given accelerating effects
 convexity hedging have. However, even yields continue higher,
 reasons expect that, least current conditions, MBS-related hedging
 play lesser role.
 First, mortgage convexity concentrated traditional 30-year fixed-rate
 mortgages MBS. Right 70 percent 30-year fixed MBS

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions colleagues? not, would
 somebody like start general discussion? President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. haven’t many changes
 region since last meeting, I’ll keep comments region brief.
 Business conditions around Seventh District generally good, although still lag
 nation. Labor markets continue improve gradually, inflationary pressures remain
 moderate. Many contacts remarked growth come last year’s pace,
 they’ve also acknowledged last year unsustainably strong current moderate
 pace line long-run trends.
 Finally, Michigan still struggling, due heavy reliance Big Three

 Nonetheless, told us raising sales outlook year whole

 don’t think discount nonmarket inflation. Janet said, additional

 Looking ahead, given policy assumption Greenbook, think inflation

 case, reestablishing price stability would require much tighter policy markets currently

 I’m also concerned large amount liquidity chasing financial deals.
 early stages accommodative policy, businesses extremely cautious many capital
 investments deferred. Liquidity flowed mortgages housing.
 corporations flush cash, competition among lenders intense, money flowing rapidly
 private equity funds, banks continue relax lending terms. think may

 asymmetric policy risks, continue think raise rates comfortably

 growth comes much lower expected, stop earlier—or
 necessary. Finally, it’s pretty safe say meeting us change policy

 language later.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, reported Beige Book, activity District

 I’ll refer couple points quickly part broader discussion we’ve

 said that, want indicate, Mr. Moskow, strong

 too, concerned inflationary pressures. would favor tightening
 degree former colleague Deputy U.S. Trade Representative mentioned. We’ll
 talk wording statement later. Thank much.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Recent data, including benchmark
 revisions, altered perception economic scene noticeably. see
 underlying strength economic activity relative potential second quarter
 July. July employment report suggests job growth also gained momentum,
 developments broad range financial markets suggest market participants share
 assessment. Greenbook, sensibly, raised assumed path funds rate bring
 growth next year back pace potential.
 inflation picture clouded senses word. unclear also bit
 foreboding. picture bit foreboding benchmark revision boosts inflation

 readings performance inflation last year, although both, fortunately, suggest

 presents rather benign inflation picture.
 
 August 9, 2005

 course, issue policy much inflation past but, rather,
 headed. Given unusually small likely transitory gap two

 reasonable signal present time.
 Moving actual inflation outcomes pressures affecting inflation going forward,
 seems likely higher oil prices passed core inflation extent.
 unless rise further, effect core inflation begin dissipate next year.
 Unfortunately, think also said thing June meeting, rise again.
 Another risk relates unit labor costs, risen notably past year

 modest decrease estimates structural productivity growth, add inflation

 39 110
 
 encouraging that, even downward adjustment, productivity still seems growing
 somewhat faster robust rates achieved second half ’90s.
 I’m less concerned inflation pressures emanating component
 labor costs, namely, labor compensation. Although compensation per hour jumped recently,
 appears due one-time factors thus discounted. interpretation
 supported smaller increase reported morning’s release second quarter
 readings employment cost index, excludes items shown
 modest increases.
 Furthermore, recent increases labor compensation could part process
 labor’s share GPD returning normal levels, following period unusually

 Indeed, contacts telling us absence much pricing power, increases
 labor costs hurting bottom lines. increased pressure margins appears

 reasons, I’m inclined think inflationary concerns unit

 Another source inflationary pressure relates slack labor market. view,
 whisker slack probably still remains, balance probably less saw
 June. course, unemployment rate remained 5 percent July, measures,
 employment-population ratio, survey job market perceptions, industrial capacity
 utilization signal bit less slack.
 So, overall, economy noticeably stronger seemed likely June.
 slack remained time eliminated, trajectory inflation shifted
 bit. market’s expectations concerning degree Fed tightening increased,
 longer-term yields. consider obvious continue path raising

 comparison, inflation expectations remarkably stable. Inflation

 It’s quite striking stronger real outlook intermeeting period led

 Manufacturing activity District also improved since June, although remains

 summary, temporary lull activity spring, economic conditions
 Third District strengthened outlook positive. Regional business contacts remain

 Incoming data suggest national economy also regained momentum since

 Turning national economy, I’ll also focus couple areas policy
 implications, think already referenced question period
 others. first growth output has, anything, somewhat stronger recently
 expected, even though NIPA revisions tell us economy somewhat
 lower growth path thought. Others may share view, think I,
 probably we, often tended underestimate underforecast output growth.
 may acknowledging based fact forecasts, including
 Greenbook, revised remainder year. believe President Stern,
 think confirmed this, reminded us once—and maybe earlier
 expansion getting uneasy—to faith, seems right.
 I’m also perhaps sensitive know data revisions
 show us higher levels inflation recent quarters. recognize upward
 revisions core PCE series imputed prices. Nonetheless, level measured
 inflation gotten closer upper bounds comfort level, well others,
 think sensitive forces could, despite recent monthly data
 encouraging, exert upward pressure prices period ahead.
 Although go back check, would guess adjustment estimated
 output gap reflected today’s Greenbook one largest between-meeting adjustments

 First, clear failure labor force participation rates rebound following
 recession means slack economy greater reflected currently
 unemployment rate. Atlanta staff’s recent research indicates—when one controls
 changes worker characteristics, changes individual behavior preferences,
 differences economic environment—that labor force participation rates likely
 return anytime soon peak level seen 2000.
 Second, looking upcoming changes labor market demographics hit
 economy soon next year, change substantially think labor
 markets job creation economy. read data correctly, projections BLS
 [Bureau Labor Statistics] Social Security Administration show nearly 400,000
 workers retire 2006 enter labor market. trend accelerate year
 year, baby boomers reach retirement age. unlikely completely offset
 increases might see older worker labor force participation.
 cumulative deficit workers could reach nearly two million 2009 four

 wouldn’t object wording. don’t think it’s descriptive might be.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Bill Poole’s caveat right here. Even you’re
 technically correct, it’s questionable much want change statement language
 don’t to.
 MR. SANTOMERO. That’s fine.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know, initial claims moved much
 since last meeting, it’s little hard make case. word change now,
 since we’re changing little, going made think we’d want
 many people paid read statement interpret
 meaning. So, think little careful that. Unless something statement
 obviously getting incorrect—clearly, can’t that—it’s probably better make
 change.
 MR. SANTOMERO. Fair enough.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation. given
 comment made less change statement better, like President

 May employment report originally 73,000 payroll jobs revised

 going put two cents in, might suggest adding something along lines
 “unwelcome rise inflation,” I’ll wait.

 think evolution language initial draft Brian circulated current

 think slightly better balance currently structured.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must say also pushing toward somewhat better

 way move last phrase up, creates policy issues judgment.
 I’d prefer poor clear language [laughter] certainly don’t want convey

 Would read appropriate directive?
 MS. DANKER. I’ll reading directive risk assessment page 23
 Bluebook: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions
