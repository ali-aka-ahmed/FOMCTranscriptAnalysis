 june 29-30, 2005

 second point look relationship rise price either

 final, question, talk 20 percent declin hous price
 would term basic macroeconom effect it. but, cours,
 wouldn’t happen overnight. someth would make happen. and, consid current

 mr. gallin. certainli wouldn’t want sai break point there.
 again, go back convers i’ve homebuild, it’s worth,

 mr. gallin. ye, that’s base talk builder, oppos

 mr. peach. could add point: spring ’87, rapid increas

 surprisingli resili face fairli steep increas.
 chairman greenspan. governor kohn.
 mr. kohn. thank you, mr. chairman. three question. first on
 price-to-rent ratio. we’ve treat adjust come price.
 want ask josh particularli whether, you’ve look micro data think
 thi, dynam innov led shift rent home
 ownership might artifici depress rent rel price. wonder, shift
 over, rent start rise faster close gap wai—us 20 percent.
 question thought that. observ would present much
 difficult situat us sit around tabl. would kind like suppli shock
 price would rise, inflat would higher—and homeown’ equival rent
 would rise faster—and we’d face difficult situat. pretti much know
 
 june 29-30, 2005
 
 54 234
 
 hous price fall. that’s pure demand shock. rent start rise, that’s anoth matter.
 wonder you’d comment that.
 then, floor, let ask question glenn john. glenn,
 1994 bubbl analog, surpris see classifi bubbl. think
 inflat scare then, also real rate adjust time. look
 survei, think wouldn’t seen much increas inflat expect. agre
 rais real rate order prevent happen. seem

 inflat. see inflat move, we’ve got someth that, wherea we’re
 respons rel price hous equiti thing. wouldn’t put 1994
 list situat might think we’re look issu hous-price gain.
 seem differ. i’d like hear comment that.
 final, question john point misalloc
 resourc. doesn’t matter state busi cycl is? hadn’t mani
 hous built much consumpt last year, would
 unemploy. it’s obviou resourc misalloc. resourc went
 build hous, furnitur, car, forth might unemploi, especi
 rais rate order lean hous-price increas. had, sure
 unemploy would higher. seem it’s on thing talk misalloc
 resourc two state full employ, it’s anoth thing talk misalloc
 resourc would otherwis slack economi. latter case don’t think
 realli misalloc resourc. there’s opportun cost.
 mr. gallin. want start rent? give other time think.

 i’ve look rent side pictur. idea perhap price get

 correct, were. work i’ve done give littl hint
 evid mayb rent bit correct. so, might see go forward rent
 growth slightli higher otherwis would been. statist speak, it’s basic
 differ zero. statist, doesn’t look like rent correct. realli
 seem happen rent go rate determin econom condit
 price move around them.
 mr. kohn. don’t see anyth current situat would differenti
 past histori regard. guess question.
 mr. gallin. not, certainli respect rent. would like sai also
 agre comment financi innov could well justifi reason
 hous price higher usual rel price. think thing differ.
 don’t see anyth suggest worri rental inflat and, result,
 overal inflat.
 mr. rudebusch. regard equiti price bond price, reason includ
 comparison make coupl point. on, comment often made can’t
 second-guess financi market financi market particip. seem mai true
 equiti market particip less true bond market particip. take “inflat scare”
 “credibl gap” “conundrum” anoth term situat idea
 fundament we’re sure bond market particip think.
 now, it’s true there’s differ clear idea reaction

 question is: draw lesson? region dispar complet differ
 market, that’s separ issu.
 event, on reason behind hous price appreci, perhap,
 low long rate. bond rate conundrum. perhap misalign bond price lead
 misalign hous price. so, on could perhap make argument it’s bond

 that.
 mr. william. fact, third scenario consid involv try emphas
