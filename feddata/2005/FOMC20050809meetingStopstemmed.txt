 mr. pool. thank you, mr. chairman. support recommend 25 basi
 point, support recommend repeat statement. would two
 suggest rational part statement. first, row 3 would elimin word
 “gradual” sai “labor market condit continu improv.” second, row 4 think
 syntax would work bit better two sentenc read “core inflat
 rel low recent month, pressur inflat stai elev. longer-term
 inflat expect remain well contain.” think read littl better. paradox
 perhap, think repeat essenti languag actual give us maximum possibl
 flexibl futur. anyth might try chang would open possibl
 misinterpret market.
 look ahead, think it’s go simpl point add statement
 statement sai monetari accommod substanti remov.
 tricki part—the tough issu deal with—is whether futur want

 mr. santomero. rejoin, wouldn’t describ “rapidli” improv
 labor market would argu improv—period. that’s probabl better
 character last 12 month, year date, last three month. number
 180,000 indic pretti good job market. that’s issu would address.
 wouldn’t object word. don’t think it’s descript might be.
 chairman greenspan. think bill pool’s caveat right here. even you’re
 technic correct, it’s question much want chang statement languag
 don’t to.
 mr. santomero. that’s fine.
 chairman greenspan. know, initi claim move much
 sinc last meet, it’s littl hard make case. word chang now,
 sinc we’re chang littl, go made think we’d want
 mani peopl paid read statement interpret
 mean. so, think littl care that. unless someth statement
 obvious get incorrect—clearli, can’t that—it’s probabl better make
 chang.
 mr. santomero. fair enough.

 mr. guynn. mr. chairman, support recommend. accept
 argument fiddl word, must sai also would prefer take word
 “gradual” out. share sandi’s concern that, read liter, phrase “core inflat
