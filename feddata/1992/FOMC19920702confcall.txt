Transcript of Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call
July 2, 1992
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone.
The Board a few
minutes ago voted 7 to 0 to lower the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 3

be more relevant than we had been expecting. I might also say,
incidentally, that this afternoon we will be publishing an
unexpectedly large decline in M2 of $10.6 billion for the latest week;
and at this stage preliminary numbers for the subsequent week show
modest further declines.
Let me read the official text that we will release at 9:15
"The Federal Reserve Board today approved a
a.m. this morning:
reduction in the discount rate from 3-1/2 percent to 3 percent,
effective immediately. Action was taken in light of sustained
weakness in credit and money growth, continued movement toward price
stability, and the uneven progress of the economic recovery. In
making the change the Board voted on a recommendation submitted by the
board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The
discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository
institutions when they borrow from their regional Federal Reserve
Banks."
End of press release. I intend to allow the 50 basis point
reduction in the discount rate to pass through fully to the funds
rate. Are there any comments?
MR. BLACK.
Bob Black.

It seems appropriate to me, Mr. Chairman;

we'd release them separately.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, if we can get a number of Reserve
Banks in sometime today, I think that would be very helpful.

Any further comments?
