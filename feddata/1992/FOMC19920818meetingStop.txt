 I'm

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. issue pretty clear legally.

 Actually, point going make builds this.

 Much District's focus continues auto
 sector declined bit since last meeting.
 third-quarter production schedules, earlier seemed pretty
 strong, reduced quite substantially, principally due GM's
 cutback. Whereas originally third-quarter schedules set
 18 percent third-quarter 1991 levels,
 reduced 11 percent [over year-earlier level].

 would expect effect auto sector, earlier might
 effect third-quarter GDP 1 percent, reduced

 Retail sales area continue tough;
 merchandise move discounted prices. pricing
 techniques become very, aggressive. least one retailer
 talked pretty good early part July; end

 Offsetting this, though, steel business continues

 Indeed, current order
 rate little higher that, expect order rate
 come end year 140,000 units.
 residential housing business also quite strong. New

 MR. KOHN. Well, question is:

 Now, might get wild

 about, feel confidence within tolerable range
