 Without objection.
 
 Bill McDonough,
 
 MR. MCDONOUGH. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, ladies,
 gentlemen.
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think it's apparent we're moving
 direction Committee strongly urged last
 year two.
 personal impression move
 direction [Bundesbank Vice President] Tietmeyer suggesting
 regard selling U.S. holdings marks. second question
 raised, namely balance portfolio,
 really quite important address get impression-indeed, I'm sure--that coherent mechanism employed
 accumulating foreign balances manner way
 related rational portfolio long-term intervention
 purposes. we're finally getting point we're
 slimming toward reasonable aggregative level, it's probably
 wise put back table fact long-term-both strategic tactical--position Foreign Desk.
 think might useful recommendations coming
 regard.
 MR. MCDONOUGH.
 
 Certainly.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. open meeting questions
 specific hope member use occasion indicate
 whether still board position

 Well, think still large

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 

 
 Caution noted.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 It's worthwhile us give thought

 far go.
 know that's difficult, move
 forward think that's something start confront.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, agree fully. I've never

 believe content heard indicates Bill ought
 go ahead see whether formulate appropriate
 longer-term strategy. guess next meeting would

 questions, I'll take motion ratifying--no, don't
 ratify anything. Let's move Domestic Desk, Peter.
 MR. STERNLIGHT.

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 [Statement--see
 
 Questions Peter?
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, generally
 aware, wanted bring Committee's attention fact
 multiple investigations Salomon Brothers incident last
 summer may coming head near future.
 say "may"
 complex matter things could change even
 eleventh hour.
 don't think characterize bottom line
 process except say major effort made
 official agencies--the U.S. Attorney, Justice Department,
 SEC, Treasury, Federal Reserve--to act way
 puts unhappy event behind everybody coordinated fashion.
 said, number things could change, including obvious
 --the precise timing. specific issues primary dealer
 status status Salomon's relationship Treasury
 context bidding restrictions put last year
 addressed well. intention try address
 issues context consistent entirety
 solution. Again, can't characterize likely bottom line,
 still don't quite know pieces bottom line are,
 thought important Committee broadly aware
 seems likely, means certain, could get put bed
 near future.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions Peter
 
 Jerry?
 MR. LINDSEY. help memory this.
 recall last time issue came up, felony
 involved this, suspension automatic, isn't it?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, first all, Governor
 Lindsey, new guidelines reference fact
 firm pleads guilty nolo contendere criminal charge,
 sanction would follow automatically. However, Congressional
 testimony went rather great lengths say specific
 provision would necessarily apply ex post Salomon
 situation. Therefore, even firm indicted criminal
 charge, still would flexibility impose sanction even
 though specific provision, followed event, there.
 quite clear saying feel
 necessarily bound context events last August.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Thank information.

 MR. PRELL.

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 [Statement--see
 
 Questions Mr. Prell?
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, went risks
 forecast.
 seems areas economy
 could turn somewhat better.
 work we've done suggests
 perhaps could get greater strength residential sector.
 It's conceivable dollar may end somewhat weaker
 estimated forecast net exports would continue
 somewhat better well.
 equipment area could stronger.
 finally, inventories--though likely get back
 traditional relationship--could perhaps change much seems
 implied forecast.
 look risks, see
 real symmetry risks forecast think might
 predominance risks one side other?
 strikes
 opposed [forecast time the] prior FOMC meeting
 that, least terms visibility, seem upside
 risks weren't before.
 MR. PRELL. Well, we've felt balance risks also
 even last couple forecasts
 much last year. think repeatedly flagged
 perceived asymmetry probability distribution
 last year. reasonably comfortable forecast
 presenting fairly balanced risks.
 think items
 mentioned plausible story. one reservation would
 light recent data latest housing market data
 disappointing relative even meager expectations.
 probably
 low forecast second-quarter housing starts
 anyone yet April figures--one month admittedly--do paint
 weaker picture.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Although rates come down.
 
 MR. PRELL. Rates come observers sensed

 are.
 
 we're exactly sure
 
 MR. PARRY.
 
 So, would say risks still relatively
 
 MR. PRELL.
 
 think they're reasonably balanced here.
 
 balanced?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Black.
 
 MR. BLACK. Mike, reading Greenbook, concluded
 thought first-quarter GNP, rather GDP--I haven't made
 transition completely--increased 3 percent rate.
 reading
 briefing papers last night, thought first going
 say 3.3 percent looked chart appeared
 might go high 4 percent. best guess
 figure really might be?
 MR. PRELL.
 Let give arithmetic [to extent]
 able translations.
 Every number come
 since BEA's initial estimate higher
 anticipated, least revision March housing starts,
 small impact. cumulate figures,
 come point 4 percent increase GDP.
 That's
 assuming merchandise trade figure comes right
 assumption. could higher; could lower.
 feeling
 additional goods sold might tilting risks
 toward lower [trade figure].
 So, that's are,
 think it's fair statement juncture. Now, BEA confront
 anomalies noted, take
 account. room maneuver, think
 expect substantial revision.
 MR. BLACK. really would something surprise
 private economy much, wouldn't it?
 MR. PRELL. Indeed.
 It's looking backward, don't think
 everyone caught this. see number private
 analysts talking last week growth
 around 3 percent, probably refine bit.
 So, it's
 unlikely total shock, it's coming high side
 expectations, well high side.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mike, forecast implicit
 decline long nominal rates.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Explicit decline!
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Explicit decline, excuse me!
 forgot
 Greenbook. Yet long rates seem [be stuck in] trading
 range; think find awfully stubborn. Suppose stay
 trading range. much risk forecast
 decline next year long rates?
 MR. PRELL.
 Well, I'm sure one would define
 "recent" trading range. look period since early
 
 5/19/92
 
 February recently, think we're pressing lower
 limits [of range] morning, could conceivably break
 that.
 Looking broader time frame going back, bond
 yields gotten 7-3/8 percent, that's
 dimension decline we're anticipating forecast
 early next year.
 think answer question depends
 circumstances bring failure [of long rates decline].

 buoyant economy strong demands capital, obviously
 it's problem. higher inflation expectations, get
 complex issues might affect
 affordability housing on; it's inflation expectations
 real rates, may compelling negative.

 it's risk premia brought political uncertainties--and may
 year tremendous political uncertainty--or wrong
 expectations, we've occasions, could
 negative. it's really hard say ex ante.
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 May follow question?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Sure, go ahead.
 
 MR. JORDAN.

 So,

 MR. KOHN. Well, think that's right. several

 explain extent.
 Now, always case
 division money investment assets--particularly
 money deregulation Reg Q taken accounts-is hard see.
 It's hard draw bright line
 something would call money something would call investment
 assets. checkable deposits, accounts, elements
 investment assets; people hold rate expectations.
 So,
 always somewhat fuzzy picture.
 agree

 think

 It's telling us part

 So,

 MR. JORDAN.
 reason asking comes back
 Mike saying [about whether] Greenbook says month

 I'd like believe it.

 question was:

 connect
 going components money [say that] part
 optimistic outlook inflation reflects economy
 something little stronger tie to? Part it,
 assume, also slow growth M2.
 Given reason

 MR. PRELL.
 Well, let say think noted
 last Greenbook, one, didn't find narrower
 monetary aggregates enhanced narrow monetary aggregate
 you're implicitly describing providing strong evidence
 outlook. Historically, haven't found provide
 much better guidance M2 is, view
 flaws logic construction. I'd also argue
 telling story money affects inflation, there's shortrun transmission mechanism think would run
 pressures aggregate demand aggregate supply. Thus, think
 assessment pressures resource markets relevant
 short-run outlook inflation 1993.
 So, segment
 questions extent.
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 symmetric risks?
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, guess I'm skeptical meaning
 monetary aggregates right now. I'm inclined assign large
 asymmetry risk monetary aggregates
 running low. Clearly, that's judgment call.
 Others differed,
 perhaps wisely, looking progress recovery.
 one also needs interpret aggregates behaving way
 whether demand shifts changes structure
 intermediation may neutral terms
 implications cost availability credit support it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, two questions, somewhat
 technical in.nature, dealing historical [precedent] data
 series.
 One talking people getting anecdotal
 information housing market, [that information] consistent
 unfortunately pattern data announced
 morning. wondering whether evidence
 increased sensitivity mortgage rate changes housing
 fits in.
 remember one earlier nonfinancial reports
 talked almost change relationship prices
 purchases. is, prices stopped declining markets,
 hypothesis least people willing buy
 less concerned [potential] loss,
 different sign price thought.
 
 5/19/92
 
 second question, wanted get one
 first ask fits historical experience
 whether change habits.
 MR. PRELL. Well, general matter, would perceive
 interest sensitivity housing sector reduced

 elimination non-price rationing effects occurred couple
 decades ago rates moved Reg Q ceilings got
 disintermediation. introduction ARMs might work
 direction, important isn't clear. There's question

 There's affordability model, clearly

 Basically we've taken middle-ground view saying
 affordability better fear people losing

 It's hard call
 make things important.

 And, going back President Parry's comment, begin get,
 without generating strength solely housing sector,
 reasonable growth going confidence employment

 affordability, could get significantly stronger housing
 expansion forecast. We're certainly operating low
 levels even given prevailing demographic trends.
 MR. SYRON. it's worth, think analysis
 probably correct don't necessarily get symmetric behavior.
 period declining prices, relative weight
 investment side becomes somewhat important.
 second question I'm trying figure whether
 take much encouragement household data. I've always
 inclined look payroll data I'm wondering
 whether historical precedent extent
 shift restructuring that's
 going on.
 Again, one hears anecdotal stories many new
 wanted ask could

 MR. PRELL. Well, it's bad news.
 question

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Mike, looking back chart page III-3
 M2 velocity:
 Last fall around quite concerned M2

 first-quarter numbers presume [raise] nominal [GNP growth]
 first quarter somewhere 6 7 percent. makes
 V-2, one-quarter lag, shoot 4 percent.
 Doesn't
 really cast lot doubt concern slow M2 growth?
 MR. PRELL. Well, know, I've enthusiast
 view worried coincidence.
 Typically, thought lag changes
 money growth changes GDP.
 So, close timing last year
 think necessarily line normally consider

 another question. think we're looking period

 MR. KOHN. Governor Angell, work done, drawing

 last year velocity bit flatter.
 So, while, I'm

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There's another way come this,

 Namely, M2 artificially deflated [that]

 MR. PRELL. Well, without precise this, we've

 MR. PRELL. Well, repercussion ended
