 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, conditions Twelfth District
 little changed last meeting, continued weakness
 California offsetting modest growth District states.
 District-wide employment September fell 1.1 percent annual
 rate, led weakness California. California employment
 fell 3.8 percent annual rate September 2.1 percent
 October; brings state's employment new cyclical low.
 might also point there's consensus among forecasters
 actual level employment 100,000 less reported
 survey. Last year similar view employment
 exaggerated, revised figures certainly confirmed that.
 Outside California, District employment expanded 3.3
 percent annual rate September. contacts Alaska,
 Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon Utah report fairly favorable
 conditions.
 California weak; Washington conditions flat
 due production cutbacks aerospace; Hawaii affected
 slumping tourism. weakness we're seeing California
 certainly concern. Already announced cutbacks aerospace,

 MR. SYRON.
 I'm general agreement last three

 also going ask Winn question
 wide interest memoranda discussion
 compared early release directive. think Chairman's
 point absolutely right.
 assume things going
 released unless make strong case release them.
 unless show there's damage deliberative process,
 Larry's Lindsey's point, think would get early release
 entire discussion.
 Pretty clearly, agree that. unless
 show there's kind damage, very,
 thin reed lean on.
 So, wonder went
 direction earlier release directive broad form
 whether could reduce lot interest this.
 MR. WINN. Dick, go back survey Steve Neal

 think memorandum discussion would good idea, don't

 somehow can't resist giving [bank] exam

 So, even said going

 notion protecting deliberative process Sunshine
 Act; it's FOIA. Treasury, deliberative papers
 exempt process. President meets advisors

 think one see difference
 open versus closed Board meetings.
 quality discussion

 sensitivity, far different open meeting versus
 closed meeting.
 So, think entirely defensible
 existing concepts, bias.
 issue early release, first, I'm also skeptical
 notion would blunt political criticism.
 new Congress new Administration, don't like sending
 signal we're mood change we're malleable.
 think we're pretty strong position starting

 It's particularly poor idea something unilaterally-to volunteer turn plead guilty. least

 it's early

 [Laughter]
 Releasing policy record early
 think would rob us asymmetric option. may
 argument we've overused asymmetric option, ought
 confronted directly.
 also don't like idea announcing federal funds rate
 change.
 don't like making announcements.
 We're good making
 announcements. First good making right decision
 good PR.
 last time really tried
 discount rate cut last December. said
 going last cut enough sustain
 recovery.
 Since we've cut federal funds rate 100 basis
 points discount rate 50 basis points, don't think
 added credibility.
 Bank Japan always
 they're ridiculed it.
 moved federal funds rate lot
 we've moved discount rate.
 think one reasons

 make announcement discount rate.
 move fed funds rate, ends financial pages;
 move discount rate, ends front pages.
 agree
 Governor Angell ought keep options open. would like
 see flexibility federal funds rate.
 don't know
 exactly making announcement would reduce
 frequency [of actions], feel evidence pretty clear
 would.
 So, sense process works pretty well.
 pretty good record accountability, think that's

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, day getting
 it's said, I'm sure, let try make one
 thing explicit think implicit much run
 [the discussion].
 public interest?
 That's
 we're talking about.
 think two components that.
 two public interest objectives here, they're equal
 weight. One public interest objective best possible public
 policy.
 That's essential can't compromised.
 public policy interest timely disclosure; that's one
 basics political process country. That's
 desirable. one essential; desirable
 compromise essential.
 essential part--the best
 public policy part--I think closely associated issue
 deliberative process.
 view, that's
 protect virtually cost.
 desirable public interest part
 closely associated timeliness issue.
 So, seems
 might able take look careful thinking
 meeting desirable public policy objective disclosure
 little fully today. would want
 anything would impinge upon essential part this,
 creation public policy deliberative manner.
 So,
 might do, Mr. Chairman, another occasion little time
 maybe staff paper go it, take look
 alternatives would speak timeliness prepared take
 hard line anything impinged upon deliberativeness.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. quick comment earlier release
