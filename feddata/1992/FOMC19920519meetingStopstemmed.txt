 chairman greenspan.
 
 [statement--see
 
 question mr. prell?
 
 mr. parri. mike, went risk
 forecast.
 seem area economi
 could turn somewhat better.
 work we've done suggest
 perhap could get greater strength residenti sector.
 it's conceiv dollar mai end somewhat weaker
 estim forecast net export would continu
 somewhat better well.
 equip area could stronger.
 final, inventori--though like get back

 look risk, see
 real symmetri risk forecast think might
 predomin risk on side other?
 strike

 risk weren't befor.
 mr. prell. well, we've felt balanc risk also
 even last coupl forecast
 much last year. think repeatedli flag
 perceiv asymmetri probabl distribut

 think item

 we're exactli sure
 
 mr. parri.
 
 so, would sai risk still rel
 
 mr. prell.
 
 think thei're reason balanc here.
 
 balanc?
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid black.
 
 mr. black. mike, read greenbook, conclud
 thought first-quarter gnp, rather gdp--i haven't made
 transit complet--increas 3 percent rate.
 read
 brief paper last night, thought first go
 sai 3.3 percent look chart appear
 might go high 4 percent. best guess
 figur realli might be?
 mr. prell.
 let give arithmet [to extent]
 abl translat.
 everi number come
 sinc bea's initi estim higher
 anticip, least revis march hous start,
 small impact. cumul figur,
 come point 4 percent increas gdp.
 that's
 assum merchandis trade figur come right
 assumpt. could higher; could lower.
 feel
 addit good sold might tilt risk
 toward lower [trade figur].
 so, that's ar,
 think it's fair statement junctur. now, bea confront
 anomali note, take
 account. room maneuv, think
 expect substanti revis.
 mr. black. realli would someth surpris
 privat economi much, wouldn't it?
 mr. prell. inde.
 it's look backward, don't think
 everyon caught thi. see number privat
 analyst talk last week growth
 around 3 percent, probabl refin bit.
 so, it's
 unlik total shock, it's come high side
 expect, well high side.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor lindsei.
 
 mr. lindsei. mike, forecast implicit
 declin long nomin rate.
 mr. prell.
 
 explicit declin!
 
 mr. lindsei. explicit declin, excus me!
 forgot
 greenbook. yet long rate seem [be stuck in] trade
 rang; think find awfulli stubborn. suppos stai
 trade rang. much risk forecast
 declin next year long rate?
 mr. prell.
 well, i'm sure on would defin
 "recent" trade rang. look period sinc earli
 
 5/19/92
 
 februari recent, think we're press lower
 limit [of rang] morn, could conceiv break
 that.
 look broader time frame go back, bond
 yield gotten 7-3/8 percent, that's
 dimens declin we're anticip forecast
 earli next year.
 think answer question depend
 circumst bring failur [of long rate declin].

 buoyant economi strong demand capit, obvious
 it's problem. higher inflat expect, get
 complex issu might affect
 afford hous on; it's inflat expect
 real rate, mai compel neg.

 it's risk premia brought polit uncertainti--and mai
 year tremend polit uncertainti--or wrong
 expect, we've occas, could
 neg. it's realli hard sai ex ant.
 mr. jordan.
 
 mai follow question?
 
 chairman greenspan.
 
 sure, go ahead.
 
 mr. jordan.
 greenbook, part 2, page iii-3 list
 indirect effect larri's question.
 sai "veloc rose
 despit declin opportun cost. recent weak m2
 occur face still small opportun cost."
 refer
 chart on.
 flip page iii-5
 paragraph top page sai "the lack aggress
 price deposit evid encourag investor move
 retail cd stock bond mutual fund order take
 advantag higher anticip return."
 sai, least
 compon m2, real opportun cost
 short-term yield chang chart prior page rather
 longer-term yield compon m2 like
 invest instrument like monei instrument.
 so,
 paragraph sai you've got wrong opportun cost,
 least compon monei.
 mr. kohn. well, think that's right. sever
 reserv bank, includ particular, us
 opportun cost took account intermedi- longerterm time deposit rate.
 littl better. although
 doesn't pick unexplain shortfal monei, help
 explain extent.
 now, alwai case
 divis monei invest asset--particularli
 monei deregul reg q taken account-is hard see.
 it's hard draw bright line
 someth would call monei someth would call invest
 asset. checkabl deposit, account, element
 invest asset; peopl hold rate expect.
 so,
 alwai somewhat fuzzi pictur.
 agre
 measur opportun cost probabl could improv.
 think
 on issu tell us bank aren't compet
 intermedi- longer-term cd.
 it's tell us part
 don't see loan demand; don't intend make lot
 loan futur. go back ask whether
 mean someth:
 whether rel benign redirect
 credit flow whether sai someth
 intermedi process could feed back aggreg demand.
 so,
 
 5/19/92
 
 agre point opportun cost; cut
 point, still leav lot ambigu mean
 slowdown monei.
 mr. jordan.
 reason ask come back
 mike sai [about whether] greenbook sai month
 right. greenbook sai long bond yield come

 i'd like believ it.

 question wa:

 connect
 go compon monei [sai that] part
 optimist outlook inflat reflect economi
 someth littl stronger tie to? part it,
 assum, also slow growth m2.
 given reason
 slow growth m2, comfort that?
 mr. prell.
 well, let sai think note
 last greenbook, on, didn't find narrow
 monetari aggreg enhanc narrow monetari aggreg
 you're implicitli describ provid strong evid

 much better guidanc m2 is, view
 flaw logic construct. i'd also argu
 tell stori monei affect inflat, there's shortrun transmiss mechan think would run
 pressur aggreg demand aggreg suppli. thu, think
 assess pressur resourc market relev
 short-run outlook inflat 1993.
 so, segment
 question extent.
 mr. jordan.
 
 symmetr risk?
 
 mr. prell. well, guess i'm skeptic mean
 monetari aggreg right now. i'm inclin assign larg
 asymmetri risk monetari aggreg
 run low. clearli, that's judgment call.
 other differ,
 perhap wise, look progress recoveri.
 on also need interpret aggreg behav wai
 whether demand shift chang structur
 intermedi mai neutral term
 implic cost avail credit support it.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 presid syron.
 
 mr. syron. mike, two question, somewhat
 technic in.natur, deal histor [preced] data

 on talk peopl get anecdot
 inform hous market, [that inform] consist

 hypothesi least peopl will bui
 less concern [potenti] loss,
 differ sign price thought.
 
 5/19/92
 
 second question, want get on
 first ask fit histor experi
 whether chang habit.
 mr. prell. well, gener matter, would perceiv
 interest sensit hous sector reduc
 wa, part reduc market segment--the
 elimin non-price ration effect occur coupl
 decad ago rate move reg q ceil got
 disintermedi. introduct arm might work
 direct, import isn't clear. there's question
 peopl abl consider
 mortgag rate.
 effort teas econometr equat suggest
 peopl wait rate come don't think
 rate go go move.
 short-run phenomenon doesn't seem
 import result signific span time.
 price side, depend model think

 there's afford model, clearli
 import. look mortgag rate price
 combin rel incom; sai
 consider improv afford past coupl
 side, look invest model, useryear.

 expect price movement would import

 basic we've taken middl-ground view sai
 afford better fear peopl lose

 it's hard call
 make thing import.
 think
 we've seen recent, suggest, peopl
 sensit number aspect thi.
 jump saw
 mortgag rate get low level

 and, go back presid parri's comment, begin get,
 without gener strength sole hous sector,

 afford, could get significantli stronger hous

 mr. syron. it's worth, think analysi
