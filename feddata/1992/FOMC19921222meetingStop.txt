 MR. TRUMAN. Essentially, it's linear.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 Mike, I'm little concerned signals
 we're going getting next year particular fiscal
 twist. listen Little Rock right,
 moving social spending government's books onto books
 businesses. Let's suppose that; say $50 billion
 less fiscal spending mandated benefits amount.

 think something like lump sum labor tax. mind
 markets would interpret fiscal contraction rates would
 drop, time would seeing costs rise perhaps
 we'd getting higher inflation numbers result.

 reasonable interpretation we'd seeing?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 don't want venture political judgment,
 
 but-MR. LINDSEY.
 
 No, it's "what if" question.
 
 MR. PRELL. can't argue direction you're
 saying. would look like reduced budget deficits. might

 MR. TRUMAN. Yes, though think balance

 fluctuated within relatively narrow range last

 Canada.
 Whereas Canadians, go back 12 months,

 12/22/92
 
 MR. JORDAN. Let turn questions Mike
 U.S. economy.
 looking back last year--I haven't gone
 back further--trying understand dynamics forecasts

 there, course, expected occurred

 look back third

 things would told still going quite

 Could forecasting error avoided

 MR. PRELL. Incidentally, [revised] third-quarter GDP

 quarterly numbers revised ways alter

 sure, trying

 One wonders
 whether fourth quarter last year low first
 quarter high, on, whether flaws

 pointed point first three
 quarters year--at least today's revision--there
 somewhat puzzling, growing discrepancy income
 expenditure sides accounts. things think
 need recognize [unintelligible] pattern errors.

 don't know magic forecasting tool missed.
 remind folks
 May June presented analysis

 So, M2 point wasn't missing

 MR. JORDAN.
 Let shift slightly different
 direction.
 I'm still trying understand interaction

 That's major factor attenuation

 appreciation building two-year period begins effects.
 It's like tightening monetary policy, [resulting in] weaker

 MR. PRELL. clear we've done we've
 done:
 Obviously, need make decision assumption

 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, terms District, level

 anything, rate improvement accelerated bit came
