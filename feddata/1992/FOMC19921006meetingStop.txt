 MR. BOEHNE.
 Mike, would elaborate comment
 going 3 percent zero--and presumably could [even]
 negative real [federal funds rate].
 It's article faith
 anybody taken one certainly two economics classes
 lower interest rates going positive [for] growth, I'm
 quarreling orthodoxy.
 one goes talks
 people business community consumers, one almost
 invariably runs view lower rates [solution].
 probe that, answer frequently get is:
 "If thought
 interest rates going stay down, lower rates would help.
 lower interest rates now, know you'll raise
 months year road.
 knowing rates
 going short period doesn't help I'm going
 finance whatever I'm going buy [loan] 5

 find increasingly view business
 community odds us accepted good
 [economic] relationship.
 wonder could help
 that.
 MR. PRELL.
 It's difficult question.
 think many people
 different positions perceive effects changes short-term
 rates differently.

 MR. LINDSEY.
 I'd like ask Ted Mike statistical
 question. know things don't measure well exports

 French, heard lots lots Japanese. I'm

 Howard Banks wrote piece saying cheaper Brit

 we're picking consumption might actually exports?
 MR. TRUMAN. certainly possible, though make
 two comments. One last decade Commerce
 Department dramatically improved collection data

 Moreover, see dramatic upward trend exports

 Now, question you're asking basically
 whether we're picking much be.
 answer
 may statistical system probably lagging behind
 somewhat. That's one reasons why, commented end

 services growing forecast even goods side
 shrinking.
 MR. PRELL. question raises interesting issue

 determinants.
 So, would suggest running

 suppose; you've already responded little answer

 "Long-term rates

 So, long-term expected rate inflation somehow

 together implies real short-term interest rates rising even
 nominal rates not.
 you're saying rise real
