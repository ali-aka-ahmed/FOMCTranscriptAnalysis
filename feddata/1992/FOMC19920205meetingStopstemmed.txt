 think continu unbroken tunnel would much

 whatev base drift brought us wai short-term

 virtual imposs us control long-run rate trend

 consequ, i've conclud matter strong intent

 detail yet would clear would necessari

 4-point spread, governor lindsei suggest, would proper

 it's import note regard even wide tunnel
 would still constrain trend growth m2 long period

 final, bluebook mai right suggest

 so, mr. chairman, like governor lindsei, hope committe
 give "virginia plan" favor consider.

 admit you, larri, label "the virginia

 chairman greenspan. well done, gentlemen. let rais

 don't think there's
