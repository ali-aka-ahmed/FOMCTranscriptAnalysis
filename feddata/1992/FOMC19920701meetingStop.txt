 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start
 District activity. nation whole, pace
 improvement Sixth District became evident first
 quarter tapered off.
 District's economy relatively
 dependent housing activity nation whole,
 downturn housing activity--or moderation perhaps pace
 home sales building national level--has quickly
 felt District.
 recent survey manufacturing plants
 also reflected this; respondents' outlooks bit less
 optimistic month before. time still
 relatively positive report.
 general, fairly broad-based
 moderate expansion seems taking hold areas
 District exception oil-dependent Louisiana South
 Florida.
 situation South Florida linked declines
 interest rates, would expect heavy retirement
 population there. areas, consumer spending appears
 moving ahead, nondurables, particularly apparel, continuing
 sell quite well. Auto dealers also showing improvement.
 business contacts met recently appear
 confident growth sustained, they're clearly
 disappointed pace expansion looking greater
 growth.
 time, comments don't indicate lack
 liquidity financing problem anymore. anything, they're
 reporting improved cash flows lower interest rates, several
 noted banks become increasingly aggressive efforts
 make loans. people I've talked believe
 easing policy would provide much help would
 generate enthusiasm outlook seems missing.
 Rather think it's going take long time work
 imbalances developed 1980s. others said,
 Sixth District we're hearing reports price increases
 all.
 So, [moderation] activity
 District, think still relatively good albeit quite modest.
 Now, respect national outlook, minor
 differences Greenbook various components GDP

 basically unchanged 1993.
 guess I'm little less confident
 last meeting recovery really taken
 hold, although still think we're sustainable recovery.
 may
 best time being.
 seems
 need keep mind monetary policy can't raise
 economy's potential, least short run. So, general,
 think we're moving ahead falling back perhaps rate
 growth, need measure policy response carefully.

 that, much really changed region. Gradual recovery
 seems continuing business people generally optimistic

 fast unless actual business activity accelerate least little

 much weight one wants give persistent weakness M2

 We're still inclined discount
 recent weakness we've seen feel

 uneasiness heightened excellent

 suggested M2 means dead.
 So, balance, think
 risk error moderately side rather
 way around, given renewed contraction M2 apparently
 taking place June.
 Despite whatever questions may regarding real
