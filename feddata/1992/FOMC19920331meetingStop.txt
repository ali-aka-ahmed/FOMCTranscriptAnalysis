 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. Well, agree President Melzer
 Chairman Greenspan issue.
 pattern one
 [average] Treasury maturities increasing since '70s System
 holdings decreasing maturity. means public holdings
 increased substantially [in maturity].
 Now, don't think it's
 especially good idea wander around maturity issues, whether
 it's holdings Treasury issues.
 So, think there's strong
 argument figure want be.
 I'm comfortable

 discretionary action move along maturity structure affect
 rates, especially environment.
 One look

 That's uncertainty even

 So, conclude, granted little
