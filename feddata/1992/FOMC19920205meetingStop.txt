 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well done, gentlemen. Let raise
 issues side this.
 don't think there's
 question hold basic view wish move toward
 price stability necessary condition maximum long-term real
 growth. Also, think monetary policies set around
 table, mechanisms employ achieve them, don't rest
 much simplistic cones, tunnels, whatever.
 Hopefully, we're
 looking issues somewhat greater detail understand
 relationship money GDP. said that,
 position favor "Tunnel Approach"

 think key question ask is:

 extent actually use cones operate policy?
 We're obviously acutely aware people see

 extent particular cones

 cone simplified version P*.
 Everything that's cone
 obviously P* somewhat detailed way. use P*
 guide indeed using it, obviously, last several

 Indeed, it's

 So, think ask several questions
 this.
 Would switching cones tunnels affect

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let make following
 proposal. First all, obviously sufficient interest
 pursuing tunnel proposal keep table keep
 agenda. look it.
 would essentially [address]
 Governor Phillips' concern, think quite right:
 namely, things easy normal don't think
 there's problem, don't spend time it.
 let's
 make sure readily putting agenda
 next time issue comes up, keep lose
 interest decide use it.
 Let's keep context
 alternative.
 Secondly, it's clear large majority
 voting members favor alternative I, majority willing
 accept--should occur result market forces--growth
 upper end range.
 official statements relative
 this, think it's important insert [explanation]
 wish lose gains achieved respect
 price stability actions respect monetary policy
 long run sensitive particular [issue].
 implies actual action might accept [growth in]
 upper portion cone, reluctance, certainly
 permanent phenomenon.
 So, would like put
 table vote point alternative language
 Humphrey-Hawkins report somewhat similar way Jerry put it,
 including immediately thereafter comment gains price

 certainly strong desire--or [wording] even much
 formidable that--to make certain gains
 dissipated.
 won't give exact language rough form would
 ask acceptable Committee vote on.
 MR. ANGELL. question, Mr. Chairman.
 Isn't
 danger that?
 agree majority voting members
 would accept upper part range.
 said
 Humphrey-Hawkins report, doesn't put us position
 appearing [that the] actual desired range?
 Suppose money
