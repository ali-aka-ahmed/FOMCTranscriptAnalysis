 May 18, 1993
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. going
 thunderstorms morning, trust integrate
 appropriate [unintelligible] sync.

 impression get authorities above, knowing
 Jerry Corrigan's last meeting, decided let us know
 aware that.
 anyone read drumbeat whether it's pro
 con Jerry, please let us know. We, course, going
 farewell lunch Jerry's honor Dining Room E
 meeting.
 Let say start:
 may recall number
 meetings ago raised questions security
 operation which--to use kind word--was "dubious" while.
 think record recent months, indeed pretty much back end
 last year, really extraordinarily good. cannot honestly
 say seen comment would unambiguously read
 coming FOMC meeting. think aware
 going today considerable interest outside.
 So, would suggest is:
 Let's lower guard. Let's
 cautious, think fend clever endeavors part
 lot media friends outside try infer
 meeting came out.
 don't request anything new; think
 you've fine. Let's awareness let
 guard inadvertently.
 raise questions [later] proceedings
 get discussions exchange rates, concerning
 memo colleague, Ted Truman.
 I'd like read
 relates
 up-to-date issues are.
 somewhat confidentiality issue it's directly
 context, I'll leave later.
 Shall start off? ask
 motion approve minutes meeting March 23.
 SPEAKER(?).

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 second?
 
 Second.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Al Broaddus,
 assume, available moment give us rundown
 interesting work group involved.
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll brief
 give quick background. Members Committee remember
 two years ago July 1991 meeting seemed pretty
 clear economy beginning recover. think
 members Committee recognized somewhere road
 Committee going faced prospect rising inflation
 pressures possible need change direction policy
 toward restraint.
 environment remember it, Governor
 Angell asked reasonable straightforward question,
 was:
 time arrived, would move facilitated
 change operating procedures away current
 procedure conducting policy controlling funds rate
 
 5/18/93
 
 tightly? Would change perhaps direction automatic
 adjustment funds rate response emerging inflation
 developments economic developments perhaps along lines
 nonborrowed reserve procedure used late 1979
 late 1982? case, got group System economists together
 produced two volumes answer, Governor Angell. It's
 lengthy response think interesting one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 what's volumes?
 
 going take exam
 
 MR. BROADDUS. think may take exam
 point! Actually, shorter answer delivered next
 meeting Committee August 1991 Kohn summarized
 memorandum Dave Lindsey prepared. memo reviewed several
 alternative procedures might assist next change
 direction policy. quickly: One set
 alternatives would deliberately caused somewhat greater movement
 funds rate short run effort perhaps camouflage
 disguise increase rate might taken; might
 soften least stretch market public reaction
 move. second set alternatives would involved tying
 funds rate, perhaps borrowed reserve instrument, way
 deviations M2 target. memo also noted
 automatic procedure might want substitute total reserves
 perhaps monetary base funds rate operating
 instrument. case, August 1991 meeting Committee
 discussed alternatives. And, course, memorandum
 pointed disadvantages well advantages
 according tradeoffs involved. Committee think also
 recognized current unpredictable behavior M2 might cause
 difficulties alternative procedures would
 existed much past.
 case, brought
 situation Committee mandated broadly scoped study, similar
 studies done along lines past.
 one early 1980s another early 1970s. broader
 project carried second half 1991 first half
 last year. culminated interesting two-day conference
 St. Louis Fed 16 papers topic, along
 formal discussions, presented. Economists Board staff
 Reserve Banks participated conference. also
 invited two prominent outside monetary economists, Ben McCallum
 Carnegie Mellon John Taylor Stanford, participate
 conference--actually comment particular papers cases
 give overview. wrote papers giving overview comments
 research implications. papers prepared
 conference, including discussion papers Taylor
 McCallum papers reviewing overall conference, included
 two-volume study. received volumes last week
 well summary proceedings, hope
 opportunity read haven't done already.
 summary indicates, study attempt arrive
 specific recommendations alternative procedures
 Committee adopt. think recognized rather quickly
 got would unrealistic try
 
 5/18/93
 
 study. tried lay solid analytical foundation
 discussion decisions could based. Frankly,
 concluded produced solid foundation kind
 consideration Committee wants take next step;
 think we've covered subject comprehensively. Many papers
 used state art research techniques reaching
 conclusions.
 case, summary document
 describes several formal papers detail
 presents five broad conclusions. I'm going go
 detail let paraphrase them.
 First, studied operating procedures number
 major industrial countries. found employ
 procedures similar Committee uses
 also found differences detail exist. take
 next step, might want consider whether significant
 advantages adopting procedures.
 example,
 mind something like Lombard facility Bundesbank
 available.
 Second, view current problems monetary
 aggregates indicators policy, study looked large
 number alternative indicators thrust policy future
 economic developments see whether might improve execution
 policy by, systematic way, taking account
 variables conducting policy. mind variables
 like bond rates, yield curves, commodity prices, number
 others. surprisingly, single indicator jumps says "I'm
 one focus attention."

 learn certain indicators seem better job
 particular time horizons others. So, bit filtering
 think useful there.
 third perhaps important conclusion
 reached case made Committee's current
 procedure adjusting funds rate response variety
 indicators used successfully time achieve principal
 objectives monetary policy. think lot people, like Dave
 Lindsey, suspected study done. study
 provides important solid analytical confirmation
 support conclusion. However, can't emphasize
 enough, effectiveness current policy regime depends
 critically maintenance credibility System's
 longer-term policy objectives.
 Fourth, model simulations done study
 indicated feedback mechanism guide policy might
 assistance improving results without creating lot undue
 short-term instability. Several papers particular looked
 feedback mechanisms either funds rate instrument monetary
 base instrument would [varied] systematic way response
 deviations nominal income target--for example,
 Humphrey-Hawkins projections put forth twice year--that
 might set.
 Fifth finally, research done project indicated
 greater transitory deviations funds rate permit targeting
 would characterize alternative procedures
 
 -4-
 
 5/18/93
 
 necessarily transmitted greater variability longer-term
 interest rates. So, possibility prevent us
 looking alternative procedures wished to.

 case, Mr. Chairman, principal conclusions. Again,
 think study positions Committee take next step,
 would fairly straightforward step looking particular
 changes might make. Let take opportunity thank
 everybody involved project express particularly
 appreciation Marvin Goodfriend Dave Small Board's
 staff tremendous amount work editing papers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. BROADDUS.
 I'd happy try answer questions
 anybody I'm sure Marvin Dave could help
 technical ones.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must say didn't chance

 MS. GREENE. Well, reading Greenbook last night

 So, effect, one could see financing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. comments?
 Let take
 minute fill comments heard Basle G-10
 meeting weekend last early last week. quite
 extraordinary number subdued people Europe;
 underlying fear system continuously eroding.
 continually revising estimates; talking though
 upturn somewhere future, whereas earlier year
 talking--in sort government-speak--about turn
 hand official forecasts [being revised] up. mood
 really quite good deal subdued last week. They're
 particularly concerned shortfalls revenues impacting
 budget deficits. French were, think, particularly
 traumatized that.
 mood really soft--if anything,
 worst I've seen year. British obviously feeling somewhat
 better, even among Brits slightly hollow cheerfulness
 evolving.
 event, let turn minute adjunct
 exchange rate discussion read three points Ted Truman
 recommending relative discussions exchange rates.

 comes basically experience we've observed first
 Secretary Bentsen, President, Secretary Brown. Item
 one:
 Exchange rates like interest rates, central banker
 discusses one, central banker understood discussing
 other. best comment Federal Reserve "no comment."

 way handle ask reporter "May go deep
 background?" Then, shake heads, say "no comment."
 new Administration, least parts
 Item three:
 Federal Reserve deals regularly, sensitive
 fact talk exchange rates, loose kind,
 tends unconstructive. would foolish think
 Treasury Department would able shut entirely
 sources Administration comment exchange rates, somewhat
 embarrassing Federal Reserve becomes part problem.
 course, Treasury time time may feel necessary
 make official comment exchange rates, hope
 comments deliberate well considered. recent record shows
 Treasury prepared work Federal Reserve
 occasions. That's end Ted's comments must say fully
 subscribe them.

 MR. MCDONOUGH. Assuming would happen soon enough

 MR. MCTEER. One thing would account higher

 MR. LINDSEY. Mike, morning's Wall Street Journal said

 Assuming enacted, would think 7 percent tax

 MR. PRELL. Well, remind everyone,

 price front, talking people don't sense

 exceptions, steel, reasons

 Raw aluminum prices,

 noninflationary. example, steel contract long way

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, one disagreement
 Greenbook. Greenbook implicitly reduction inflation

 seems like awfully steep deceleration inflation order
 think

 reason we've higher inflation well argued you, Mr.

 management, there's protectionism, protectionism, protectionism
 along loan guarantees failing industries
 airlines. So, matter whose side you're on, labor management,
 Uncle Sam stand behind you.
 asked another reason inflation might there.
 I'm going give you.
 don't mean say
 dominant reason. It's one people room familiar
 with. goes back redistribution income literature.

 doubt many people room readers "Nation" "American
 Prospect."
 would hope anyway. read literature
 years ago part research doctoral dissertation.
 also look Ira Magaziner's writings this.
 unspoken
 part health care plan redistribution elements. Right
 now, effectively, health care lump sum tax. It's $4,000 per
 worker payroll, paid health insurance company.
 going change, question degree,
 going become effectively proportional tax;
 it's payroll based. different income
 distributed [unevenly].
 Now, talking shift 14
 percent GDP income among various quintiles, dwarf
 whatever Reagan accomplished big factor, reverse.
 good reason believe--in fact argue four
 reasons--that least intermediate term redistribution
 likely inflationary. first comes higher tax
 wealthy. Now, short run least, would expect
 
 -26-
 
 5/18/93
 
 higher tax come savings. might true
 longer run; certainly short run part higher
 taxed people come savings. hand,
 lower taxed people it's likely augment consumption.
 demand side redistribution effect burden health care
 costs liable increase demand via increased consumption.
 supply side also two reasons suspect inflation.
 first "classic" supply side argument move
 lump sum tax proportional tax you're going get less
 output. think substitution effects
 income effects, they're going direction. I'd assume
 with, God forbid, another 9 percent payroll tax, typical
 worker pushing 50 percent marginal rate. people
 room probably around 65 percent area
 marginal rate. whopping substitution effect. income
 effect side, longer work service $4,000 bill,
 get less work end well. supply
 side reason intentional redistribution liable
 inflationary Keynesian argument nominal wages
 sticky. Effectively, low cost worker [a firm is]
 paying $4,000 health care entitled raise. unions
 representing individual certainly make point. So,
 think nominal wages rise lower end. Indeed,
 reverse probably two decades declines real wages lower
 end. hand, taxed more--who cost
 management hire--[firms] actually would force
 decline nominal wage people. would involve, say,
 middle management up. 7 8 percent inflation environment
 would easy. You'd simply hold nominal wage increases down.
 3 percent inflation environment, you're going nominal
 wage cuts.
 So, you're going bit wage/price
 spiral, rising wages workers insufficiently falling real
 wages management.
 So, four reasons--again, one
 go back literature even '20s redistribution
 effect inflation--it adds up. Now, I'm saying
 that's causing it.
 know health care story
 minds might one reason least explain why,
 [given] supply shock, higher [inflation] expectations might
 actually turn rational.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. MELZER. First terms District,

 MR. ANGELL. Jerry, comments much along
 lines thinking. learned fly airplane early

 Somehow think gauges wrong. feels

 instruments tell us inflation rising. Clearly,
 inflation going go 2-1/2 2 percent level
 thought doable recently one year ago.
 think
 Chairman correct says it's question money
 credit explains phenomenon. Clearly, others said,
 attitude question. Now, December made comments
 200 basis point increase fed funds rate and, Mr.
 Chairman, [went further] said 300 400 basis
 points really wouldn't work change attitudes. Well, guess
 don't quite agree that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. didn't say wouldn't change
 attitudes; said wouldn't change the-MR. ANGELL.
 
 result.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 --the result.
 
 5/18/93
 
 don't think
 MR. ANGELL.
 Here's think would happen.
 increase interest rates 300 basis points but, did,
 I'm quite certain price gold would immediately begin [sharp],
 quick [drop].
 would happen fast you'd go watch
 screen. made 100 basis point increase fed
 funds rate, price gold surely would turn back unless
 situation worse anticipate.
 made 50 basis point
 increase fed funds rate, don't know would happen
 price gold I'd sure like find out!
 [Laughter]
 Now, want
 remind monetary policy cannot anything growth
 except harm it. Monetary policy can't fix growth; monetary policy
 harm growth; monetary policy cause growth worse.
 agree attitude problems
 significantly held belief American people foreigners
 U.S. government budget deficit control.

 believe it's control Federal Reserve
 able stand firm. believe we'll give
 inflate way problem. Now,
 don't believe that. American people believe that,
 including, think, daughter, Jerry. Maybe doesn't even
 understand that; knows inflation going up.
 cannot make growth better period immediately ahead.
 can't that. Now, look first-quarter numbers
 Greenbook, nominal GDP 5.2 percent. Mike tells us
 trade numbers come [as projected], real GDP goes up,
 nominal GDP may go also. Now, two quarters
 eight current expansion 5.2 percent exceeded; one
 6.2 percent one 7.1 percent. eight quarters,
 5.2 percent [the third highest] everybody sitting around
 wringing hands kind growth we're [experiencing].
 Pardon me, every time look GDP quarterly data see
 variations quarter quarter. don't know going happen
 right now, monetary policy can't fix it. Monetary policy harm
 it.
 Monetary policy credibility; inflation
 credibility. Now, American people believe
 going act, phenomenon inflation attitudes
 get worse; attitudes get worse, means tradeoff gets worse.
 fix attitudes Federal Reserve quickly.
 fix attitudes, gain stature institution
 political system. democracy respects proper
 decisionmaking. need do, [inflation] attitudes
 improve.
 last meeting concerned commodity
 prices doing. know, got lucky told us

 know there's nothing get lucky. I've plenty
 econometric studies tell lucky commodity prices get.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. Clearly, haven't mastered
 timing get name list, follow
 impassioned statement. listen discussion around
 table, I'm always struck, even time, vast
 regional differences perceptions. people trying
 bring anecdotal evidence gives us clues we're
 going opposed complete reliance statistics. I'm
 particularly struck time differences regionally.
 read national situation think we're
 likely returning slower, believe sustainable,
 growth path. don't think necessarily bad.
 Certainly, areas strength, Mike pointed
 number them. represent continuation
 operating restructuring we're going through--the defense
 restructuring balance sheet adjustments.
 don't think it's
 clear long process going take. Six months ago

 along was.
 [Now] think it's pretty clear probably can't
 make kinds assessments.
 People businesses trying

 fact, think whole inflationary/stable price
 argument clearly becoming central part day-to-day business
 decisions.
 uncertainty that's associated
 Clinton economic program. think it, Administration
 office four months we've amazing
 roller coaster different thrusts. [the ideas] clearly
 trial balloons, certainly put forward
 great fervor proposed bills. still sure
 going end up. Nevertheless, arguments
 appear leading us inflationary pressures.
 So, matter
 comes out--even though didn't get stimulus bill
 think folks might question whether really stimulus
 proposal--it still leading increased inflationary pressures.
 know talked past continue
 think--and I'll echo Si's comments--that labor markets
 remain key economic environment. economy growing
 enough produce jobs hardly enough, really, accommodate
 even population growth. think unemployment rate mask
 adjustments turmoil occurring labor
 markets account downsizing, de-layering, changes
 employment needs account new technology. huge fixed
 costs associated taking new permanent employees
 clearly deterring many businesses staffing up. come back
 whole labor market question continually think it's
 flip side going happen spending whether
 consumers going able participate stimulation
 economy. So, whether setback blip,
 whether long blip plateau, think it's
 unexplainable go back entire question restructuring
 occurring.
 Let turn inflation. Like everybody else I'm
 hard time reconciling recent numbers economy. One
 observation would make shouldn't necessarily assume
 expect smooth route progress inflation
 necessarily expect smooth route recovery. bumps
 plateaus likely. expect experimentation prices
 folks attempt see get price increases stick.
 We've seen lumber prices shoot way we've also seen come
 back again. looking cattle prices, example, we've seen
 strong prices, they've finally reflected
 saw strong
 meat numbers CPI. Tobacco another example:
 [price] increases--that driving CPI--but hear
 we're going cuts.
 agree Jerry's argument
 inflation psychology.
 think inflation long
 people demanding wage increases confuse growth inflation.

 would fairly large. So, think it's going take long time
 work entire process.
 don't think lose sight
 countervailing pressures prices:
 international
 competition; weak economies, certainly domestically also
 internationally; quality improvements; improved productivity; weak
 credit conditions. things may well start reflected
 prices, see movement that's bit down.
 said that, recent CPI PPI numbers
 commodity price increases clearly disturbing.

 So, certainly agree
 Chairman area address attention

 next round even challenging.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. respect real economy, sense
 continues we're path moderate growth.
 don't
 really see change outlook mean 2-1/2 3-1/2
 percent, individual quarters ranging perhaps bit
 2 bit 4 percent. first quarter pretty well
 explained, seems me, weather pullback
 surge consumption. similar phenomenon last year.
 employment situation, know lot negativism around
 it; unemployment come peak last summer 7.7
 percent 7 percent. even California's unemployment rate
 last time came 8.6 percent; around 10 percent.
 look monthly payroll numbers, find difficult get
 depressed. monthly average payroll growth third

 quarter, 147,000 first quarter '93, eased
 119,000 April. overtime record levels employment

 So, guess people buying housing cars.
 become convinced we're headed another serious swoon.
 inflation watch, paraphrase old Ronald Reagan TV ad, last
 time question was:
 bear woods? far I'm
 concerned inflation bear sighted--not staff

 [Laughter]
 think allowed near
 woods; fear health.
 Well, it's curious phenomenon we've going
 past [several months].
 Perhaps it's blip; it's long blip
 blip. Now, suppose many hypotheses. won't bore
 personal list.
 It's especially useful
 arguments saying [upturn inflation] can't happen set
 economic fundamentals that's pretty articulately rebutted
 fact happened persisted number
 months.
 feel pretty much way notion
 basically economy slow inflation slow down.

 slow we've rising inflation. suspect inflation
 driven mostly expectations.
 That's one reasons there's
 much talk it; it's roughly people expect.
 think affect inflationary expectations, least
 market. Since think 4 percent inflation, see
 couple issues. first whether 3 percent federal funds rate
 appropriate environment. And, secondly, satisfied
 4 percent inflation? focus first question,
 immediate question, think one proposing instituting
 restrictive policy actually try get top inflation
 
 5/18/93
 
 -36-
 
 question see
 sense positive real rates.
 whether one might partially adjust nominal rate reflect
 reality higher inflation, leaving real short rates still lower
 prevailing last year. stage we're going
 think whether 4 percent inflation something want.
 thought latter part last year
 chance inflation continued decelerate could hold 3
 percent federal funds rate--that would sustainable.
 perception inflation 3 percent falling.
 serious doubts whether 3 percent federal funds rate
 sustainable. seems line; seems violate basic
 tenets common sense. last time 3 percent federal
 funds rate 1963.
 1963 inflation environment.
 one looks around world today, 3 percent short
 rates observed captivity found Japan. economic
 environment terms fundamentals clearly sluggish ours,
 so.
 Japanese inflation environment.
 inflation order 2 percentage points ours.
 Obviously, lot opportunity choose federal funds rate
 1 percent inflation rate last year chose it.
 would suggest result negative real short rates
 1970s pleasant. So, rather doubt anyone
 parachuting economic environment would choose 3 percent
 federal funds rate. Now, perhaps real short rates don't matter,
 least weak economy. certainly instruct weak economies
 eastern Europe former Soviet Union one thing
 get nominal rate about, little above,
 inflation rate. certainly felt significantly positive
 real rates made lot sense late 1990 early 1991 [even]
 negative real GDP growth concerns price stability.
 However, without aggregates guide us, think it's also
 pretty visible simple measure people may focus on. wish
 aggregates guide us; don't know happening
 hypothetical, shadow M2.
 suspect may growing pretty
 rapidly, given volume funds going stock market.

 true, clearly true, don't understand transmission
 mechanism well. don't believe lack thorough
 understanding lead us ignore seems apparent me:
 So,
 namely, 3 percent short rates seem quite bit line.
 don't lot doubt we're going feel 3
 percent needs changing. question one timing,
 argument sooner rather later.
 concern people start look recent
 inflation performance, stands direct contradiction
 publicly stated objectives. also stands visible contrast
 FOMC's inflation forecast 2-1/2 3 percent issued
 short months ago February. stand measured inflation
 shreds publicly stated convictions forecasts, concern
 long rate continue rise. Governor Angell

 that's going

 can't anything that. do,

 So, think lot stake:

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions?
 not, let
 start off.
 Frankly, found really interesting meeting
 sense new view going
 found quite intriguing. fact, think explains part
 big problem is.
 It's interesting go around table,
 especially hearing presidents, get sense
 political pessimism seems emerged. It's relatively
 recent phenomenon. It's type thing we, course,

 [unintelligible] current services deficit starts turn

 Now, superimpose deep-seated pessimism
 outlook argue transmission mechanisms we're
 used fundamentally psychological, reason slack
 labor markets affect wages essentially people react
 certain way; [assess] prospects bid markets
 accordingly, markets work. it's true, indicated
 before, price area well.
 So, major issue examining
 inflation start usually trying look
 slack markets money credit watch transmission
 affect price level. It's really important us recognize
 looking prices--assuming prices correctly calibrated,
 problems, obviously question--that price
 levels wage levels tell us people doing.
 it's us figure they're it.
 without question. question we've really got
 confront is:
 mechanism? must say, looked
 data done contemplating could,
 cannot believe anything inflation expectations
 embodied here. Clearly, actual inflation run wholly
 independently real world while; ultimately, real
 world cave in. problem, however, real
 world works, fact price movements real

 So, we're dealing interesting problem
 underlying inflationary expectations real world
 effects. cannot view type outlook stipulating

 that's happens. happens interactions

 Now, don't know whether [increase in] inflation

 Now, question procedure:
 First all,
 circumstance always believed matter we've
 always got leave Chairman maneuvering room.
 don't care
 whether directive asymmetric symmetric; that's
 irrelevant. always powerful, powerful prejudice
 leaves Chairman flexibility needs it.
 said that, putting aside views policy come
 later, mind's eye one argument asymmetric directive

 better, we're going look lot better virtue

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say "look little better,"

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. overall performance starts

 we're better well.
 So, putting aside complicated

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You're raising interesting point.
 There's timing question here. Let say sake

 inflation would less last year; much importantly
 believed inflation year going less last year.
 already mentioned would take [an inflation rate

 thinking
 2-1/2 percent nominally goal doable

 eight months, still going hold inflation last
 year's level, find unacceptable. So, think
 already enough information, nothing else needs learned,

 clear needs restrained. something less
 that--the Greenbook economy worse. want restrain?
 excesses clearly find. seems
 want tighten, we've got clear why. simply
 say "to counter inflation" really isn't enough.
 there's something
 want restrain, let's decide want restrain it.
 matter restraining expectations, let's express
