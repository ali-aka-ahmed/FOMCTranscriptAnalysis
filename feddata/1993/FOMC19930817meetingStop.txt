 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. answer question!
 first item general business I'd like call Gretchen

 MS. GREENE. Well, Mr. McDonough set high standard
 me.

 [Statement--Ms. Greene's statement

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 sense demand
 yen coming from?
 
 8/17/93
 
 MS. GREENE. Certainly one important element
 capital outflow, counterweight Japan's current
 account surplus, far smaller typically case.
 Now, obviously, there's capital [outflow] balance surplus
 accounting sense. [ex ante] demand send funds abroad
 Japanese investors pretty much dried up. invest fair
 amount active investors second quarter
 European markets, taking advantage sharp drop interest
 rates, particularly countries EMS Germany. And,
 course, got burned happened European
 monetary system. believe one reasons yen
 advanced much rapidly dollar July
 investors hedging exposures French francs
 [currencies].
 think liquidated investments
 thought breakup EMS would prompt larger
 cut interest rates taken place wanted
 get capital gains. apart burst [what might
 called] outward investment Europe immediately French
 elections, outflow small comparison previous years.
 probably single biggest fact:
 reluctance
 Japanese investment companies insurance companies investment
 trusts make meaningful outward investment countries.
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 MS. GREENE.
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 
 they're demanding yen?
 demanding fewer dollars.
 it's sort relative thing.
 
 MS. GREENE. Yes. built up, course,
 seen Japanese companies responding differently, mentioned.
 Previously believed dollar would recover
 therefore would able sell dollars higher rate,
 willing hold dollar exposures. belief
 faded, people saying:
 "I cut losses;
 get currencies regardless exchange rate is."
 that's observed Japanese exporters constantly reducing
 dollar price willing sell; past
 couple weeks important additional factor.
 MR. FORRESTAL. Gretchen, think French really
 serious imposition exchange controls
 public relations ploy try frighten speculators?

 this, would seem another blow toward-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. [Unintelligible] minutes ago
 indicated plan. That's answer
 question, understand; that's least said Tokyo.
 MS. GREENE.
 think growing concern type
 market participants; participants difficult
 authorities contact with. past large players

 class market participants--call hedge funds investment
 trusts whatever want call them--who exert enormous market
 power kind relationship

 get scared, hedging portfolios--just way
 hedging done--is enough sudden substantial

 So, think
 growing level frustration, guess question is:

 frustration ultimately lead?

 not, let's move
 
 MS. LOVETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. hope hear

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Let's move

 MR. SIEGMAN.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions either gentleman?
 
 MR. SYRON. Mike, looking autos pattern
 see us, wondering feel leasing
 side whether is--and much--an incentive factor might
 come along like earlier incentives saw prices.
 Specifically, I'm thinking leasing terms seem
 ways similar direct price sales promotional devices saw
 earlier. much really shade residuals very,
 closely? even going negative residuals
 incentive kind thing? terms view
 going happen sales going forward, wonder whether
 likely reverse point.
 MR. PRELL. Well, think discussion
 Greenbook. Pinning amount leasing transactions
 consumers little difficult.
 survey evidence
 we're aware suggests perhaps quarter
 consumer car sales leases. seem
 way major manufacturers gone substitute
 degree kind price shaving previously done--rebates
 techniques. Clearly, they've trying firm

 margins. One step diminish flow cars going
 rental companies come back nearly new perceived
 fairly close substitutes new cars. partly response
 general rise retail demand, meant didn't
 sell cars concessionary terms [nor did] rental car
 companies.
 demand remains uptrend think we're seeing,
 Japanese car prices likely even pressure
 might anticipated light appreciation
 yen, may tightening market,
 firming prices either less aggressive residual
 valuations leases devices.
 don't think
 good insight trick they're going use.
 MR. SYRON. feeling sort
 timing happened before. think [kinds
 incentives] going offered discrete number weeks
 cases, never mind months, removed
 point.
 MR. PRELL. Well, seem maintained incentives.
 They've broadened recently. don't think deep
 quite broad we've seen end model year
 clearance periods stocks pretty [low].
 So, might
 enter new year less overhang prior year models. "end
 year" gotten bit vaguer. see new models coming
 different times year; case Chrysler, one
 reasons they're pushing hard they're going
 bringing new models end year, sort '94-1/2
 [model].
 So, there's lot going here. sense
 moderate level promotional activity going
 [at time] year two ago. trend probably
 persist period.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Thank you. Mike, appendix Part
 II Greenbook Budget Reconciliation Act think
 would seem though onevery informative interesting.
 for-one terms tax increases spending cuts looks fairly
 legitimate there. also got impression perhaps
 quite backloaded terms expenditure cuts originally
 case. defining issues terms spending
 cuts making less pure number?
 significance, know major criticism earlier
 process? wonder could comment
 changed know last Greenbook ratio 8 1
 1994 terms tax increases versus expenditure cuts. And,
 course, Boskin article Wall Street Journal
 9 1 ratio entire period. seems though
 dramatic changes.
 MR. PRELL. Well, honest can't give neat
 accounting this. didn't perceive outcome
 drastically different we've assuming previously.
 major change smaller energy tax we'd anticipating.
 thought they'd come somewhere House Senate

 whether it's high powered expenditure another matter.

 So, we're looking consumption behavior on, would
 allocate restraint 1993.
 MR. PARRY. past times fee increases
 counted expenditure cuts; much that?
 MR. PRELL. don't think lot this.
 obviously still talk things terms grazing
 fees mining on; aren't big dollars. But, no, don't
 think much here.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions?
 like start tour de table?
 
 not, would
 
 MR. KEEHN. Let start off, Mr. Chairman.
 flood, certainly serious event
 directly involved, would comment significant
 changes District economy since last meeting. Broadly,
 things seem much same.
 auto business continues
 strong. get closer end 1993, industry raising
 sales forecasts year. Third-quarter production schedules
 running 20 percent last year expectation
 fourth-quarter schedules higher last year
 margin much smaller. say, though,
 something growing concern Detroit auto business
 run ahead national economy. unless employment
 disposable income gains catch up, sales levels could
 jeopardy. Order flows heavy trucks slowed bit
 industry doesn't, least far, view significant.
 coming strong period think current softness may
 well reflection summer doldrums.
 steel business, outcome trade cases,
 certainly disappointing perspective, anticipated
 reduce annual domestic shipments 2 million tons. Also,
 going limiting effect price increases.
 announced increase 2-1/2 percent October clearly
 going stick. think next increase
 earlier next January. Despite this, though, underlying
 business continues good forecasting shipments
 year 86 87 million tons. Contrary national
 numbers, retail sales District July comparatively good.
 
 8/17/93
 
 larger chains difficult time
 experienced pretty strong gains.
 ag sector still, course, premature judge
 full economic impact flood. broader perspective,
 don't think effect nearly large one might guess
 watching television coverage it.
 Growing conditions many
 areas directly affected really good.
 higher crop prices, farm income year expected
 pretty good. say growing cycle behind
 several weeks year--we got late start may remember
 wetness delayed growing cycle--an early frost
 year would much significant problem would normally
 case.
 ag equipment business, level activity
 continues pretty high. Retail sales one manufacturer
 talked running 20 percent ahead last year
 inventories reasonably low production current
 quarter running 25 percent last year. One manufacturer
 construction equipment notes business equipment
 used cleanup flood.
 regard inflation, continue impressed
 restrained price pressures seem be. Many manufacturers say
 cost outside purchases year increase 1
 percent even little less.
 One large manufacturer talked
 'to says fact going reduction
 outside purchase prices costs year 1 percent.
 Virtually everybody talk to--it's true retailers
 manufacturers--says marketplace pressures very, tough
 aren't signs widespread price increases.
 somewhat continuing somber note, think line
 restraint hiring keep hearing getting harder
 harder passage time.
 [Firms] take
 additional full-time employees, continuing rely
 overtime out-sourcing deal increased production
 requirements. out-sourcing increase employment, least
 indirect sense, it's kind employment increase
 we've past cycles.
 must say employment
 restraint become something absolute mindset among growing
 number CEOs.
 Turning national economy, outlook almost
 surprisingly unchanged, much line forecast
 developed time last meeting FOMC. think
 point risks evenly balanced. must say
 seem like pretty unexciting outlook. Thank you.
 MR. ANGELL.
 Si, late start planting:
 pretty
 universal throughout District way Iowa Michigan?
 MR. KEEHN. It's certainly true Iowa, Wisconsin,
 Michigan, quite much Indiana. Indiana going
 good year, much better they've past.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Indiana ample moisture?
 
 Production Indiana looks good
 MR. KEEHN. Yes.
 delighted high prices.

 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Illinois, presume, like
 
 [the others]?
 
 MR. KEEHN. good Indiana. It's Iowa

 I'm delighted hear Illinois hasn't
 
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Economic activity
 much Twelfth District clearly remains weaker
 nation whole. District employment fell 2 percent annual
 rate June, marking fourth consecutive monthly decline.
 fall employment due largely job losses California
 Washington. California completed three years recession;
 July 1990 July 1993 state lost 560,000 jobs,
 180,000 jobs lost last year. However, July
 employment report somewhat encouraging. see
 increase California 34,000 far payroll employment
 concerned. half increase due rise state
 local government employment linked unusual seasonal
 factors.
 Civilian employment also increased July. However,
 large surge labor force caused
 unemployment rate rise 9.1 9.8 percent. Despite July
 report, already announced layoffs reports contacts suggest
 continued weakness several sectors California economy.
 believe state bump along bottom remain drag
 District growth foreseeable future.
 Conditions state Washington also concern,
 particularly Puget Sound area. Recent employment reports
 state disappointing; June employment state
 actually fell annualized rate 5.7 percent. Significant

 losses seen manufacturing, construction, trade.
 aerospace, employment fallen 7.4 percent past year,
 largely result cutbacks Boeing. addition, recent
 reports suggest Boeing may cut production called
 currently published plans.
 Conditions rest District mixed, robust
 conditions inter-mountain states flat sluggish
 conditions elsewhere. depressed visitor industry stalled
 Three
 Hawaiian economy. contrast, Nevada boom continues.
 major hotel projects add 10,000 rooms Las Vegas coming
 winter existing stock 76,000 rooms.
 Construction jobs
 Nevada 20 percent past year.
 Turning national economy, although one could certainly
 quibble specific numbers Greenbook forecast, think
 basic message moderate growth certainly likely outcome
 next year half.
 I'd admit, though, I'm
 bit optimistic inflation Greenbook.
 three consecutive months low inflation,
 consistent view good part inflation scare
 earlier year aberration. given current
 slack labor markets also prospects continued moderate
 economic growth, seems inflation could come bit
 lower shown Greenbook. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, think report little
 happier Bob Parry's, Mr. Chairman.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 shouldn't hard!
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Except Nevada! said that, though,
 growth Sixth District continuing decelerate.
 expansion still leading nation anticipate
 margin narrow, possible exception Georgia. We're
 estimating end July unemployment rate
 District 6 percent; time survey
 manufacturing plants District suggests little growth
 employment likely occur next six months.
 fact,
 survey actually shows decline, think
 seasonal factors there. clear message
 manufacturers looking add employees all.

 survey also suggests production weak July even
 taking account likely seasonal declines activity.
 areas strength we're continuing see
 Sixth District retail sales, particularly durables,
 new orders exports, although exports major part
 District output mix. strength durables comes basically
 good activity single-family housing. pace sales
 flattened areas July, well ahead healthy year-ago

 Also, office space absorption first half year twice

 negative side, base closings Florida,
 populous state, continue exert negative pull state's
 economy. pressures state budgets moderating,
 largely due special factors, particularly gambling [activity].
 Gambling adding significantly coffers Mississippi.
 may read, Georgia started lottery
 lottery ticket sales running well ahead expectations.
 I'm sure that's desirable kind economic activity
 have, is.
 Higher natural gas prices increased
 rig count Louisiana they're helping state considerably.
 Unlike Midwest we've experiencing drought; many areas
 Southeast that's hurting agriculture, although that's
 relatively small factor output mix.
 So, balance, conditions reasonably good
 time. Concerns hear basically relate
 national international areas District.
 
 8/17/93
 
 -10-
 
 uncertainty surrounding budget process removed
 passage legislation. still good deal concern
 health [care] program costs may coming along
 conjunction that. There's also, interestingly, great deal
 concern NAFTA legislation--there's good deal support
 NAFTA District--and may difficulty
 passage Congress.
 Looking national picture, outlook 1993
 Greenbook's. see stronger real GDP
 employment growth 1994. We're estimating business start
 add labor months ahead public policy
 uncertainties unwind current staffing levels become tight.
 think that's got gambling type forecast
 certainly don't hear much employment gains. view
 staff there's going come point business
 simply able continue present levels temporary
 employees overtime. pretty much outlook
 inflation average, though upward pressures begin emerge near
 end forecast horizon. seems clear many
 fundamentals place continuation expansion.
 take slack economy perhaps move
 expansion potential least while.
 think, though, uncertainties surrounding
 outlook. positive side, certainly feel little
 comfortable European situation. think recovery
 occur little sooner expected. Also, recent declines
 long-term interest rates certainly beneficial.
 negative side, continuing uncertainties surrounding
 consumer business attitudes growing health care program
 perhaps continuing contentious debate budget.
 major concern hear relating uncertainty federal
 spending may cut much hoped
 initiatives end funded indirect taxes business
 payrolls. It's difficult assess net impact
 factors, little concerned--or maybe little
 concerned--that forecast real GDP year fallen
 almost full percentage point since March meeting. Board
 staff estimate 1994 reduced additional 1/2
 percentage point since then. So, conclusion, I'm concerned
 risks forecast growth remain sluggish
 longer anticipate unemployment continue
 unacceptably high levels. Thank you.
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, might add something?
 earlier comment--the comment medical expenses--raises
 interesting point. One major savings mandatory spending
 side cuts Medicare Medicaid costs. Economically one
 would anticipate lot cost shifting here, might call
 question exactly one wants view quality expenditure
 reduction. also user fees, things like FCC auction
 expectations on; think medical cost issue
 big one, looking back.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 8/17/93
 
 MR. BOEHNE. District economy continues muddle along.
 could almost ditto comments month ago. pattern
 essentially same:
 sluggish manufacturing, soft retail sales,
 improvement residential construction, nonresidential deep
 hole, slow employment growth. attitude adding workers
 don't strong. Wage increases probably
 4 4-1/2 percent range; one hears
 companies area.
 national level, think moderate growth theme
 right one; 2-1/2 percent number one wants pinpoint
 it.
 It's hard see major risks would cause significant
 break-out side. Likewise, it's hard see break-out
 side would cause cumulative downturn. Nonetheless,
 pattern, Bob Forrestal pointed out, starting
 year optimistically scaling growth
 forecasts.
 think business attitude
 good quarter, take don't think it's going continue
 pace; bad quarter, say well, maybe
 ought scale forecast. we're talking major
 risks either side, suspect we're wrong may
 somewhat sluggish economic growth. inflation think
 numbers seeing understate underlying rate
 inflation numbers earlier year overstated it.
 sense we're likely see acceleration inflation
 underlying fundamentals doubt we'll see much
 deceleration. think kind stuck
 inflation. So, it's pretty much change, unexciting,
 particularly satisfying outlook.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding
 District, really hasn't much change region either,
 like many regions reports far. Growth seems
 continuing relatively moderate pace overall.
 experiencing
 strengthening housing activity that, least
 Beigebook reports, take may occurring parts
 country, although guess doesn't conform well
 figure reported earlier, Mike. Also, tourist activity
 region very, strong especially along coast recent
 weeks. Despite auto episode, Mr. Chairman, mood
 business contacts less optimistic even
 recently July meeting.
 think people worried
 tax increase definitely coming.
 anything,
 may even worried health care reform package,
 get it, them. think concerns
 clearly negative impact economic activity, especially
 employment region; happening time.
 strikes that, anything, negative may intensified
 recently.
 far national economy concerned, wouldn't argue
 Greenbook's real GDP projections point. Initially
 saw 2.3 percent annual rate growth real GDP
 you're projecting second half year, Mike, struck
 little low side light strong final demand
 second quarter, evidence least strength housing,
 
 -12-
 
 8/17/93
 
 nice sharp decline long-term interest rates. negative
 attitudes budget package fostered, said minute
 ago, real; don't think there's doubt could
 put significant drag economy months ahead. So, 2.3
 percent growth strikes reasonable point.

 guess, would say risks may slightly side
 much.
 Now, said real economic activity,
 let say think important development since
 last meeting inflation interest rate fronts.
 may well recent price data overstating progress
 we're making, I'm least somewhat encouraged I've seen.
 Core CPI risen annual rate 2-1/2 percent
 last five months, pretty good hunk time.
 July figure, annualized rate increase core CPI far
 1993 first time dropped little 1992 rate.
 Again, may overstate progress we're making but, think Bob
 Parry suggested, strikes can't sure yet may
 finally making progress toward bringing longer-term trend
 inflation rate down.
 positive, think clearly related, development
 nice decline we've recently long-term interest rates.
 recall projections made back beginning
 year, consensus forecast 30-year bond rate
 7-1/2 percent; don't believe anybody looking anything
 low 6-1/2 percent, now. Clearly, budget package
 played role either prospective deficit
 reduction maybe people think it's going knock heck
 economy. whatever contribution fiscal side
 made bringing long-term rates down, think there's good chance
 recent monetary policy actions statements also
 played least equal role, perhaps even greater role.
 news tilt toward tightness May meeting, overall
 tone emphasis comments Humphrey-Hawkins meeting, Mr.
 Chairman, think sent strong signals markets
 public that, whatever may happened past, time around
 quite serious keeping inflation control
 recovery proceeds. So, short, think we've bought additional
 credibility recently, think contributed significantly
 rally bond market. would hope policy
 won't anything reverse progress strikes
 improved financial conditions probably main thing
 economy going right now. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, similar many
 places, I'd say region's economy continues muddle
 along; it's accelerating it's slowing either.

 thing extraordinary, particularly given

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, I've either academic
 life else government employee, I've never
 opportunity pay kind taxes people going

 kicks either buying lottery tickets pot gets really,
 really big else figuring taxes people well
 endowed. I'd like talk briefly
 first quarter going look like self-employed business
 person makes $1 million. roughly 50,000
 individuals country. reduce half million

 roughly type situation. earnings

 going due next April 15th first-quarter estimated

 retroactive tax increase. latter bit less $25,000;
 total retroactive tax increase order $74,000.
 first-quarter FICA $14,000.
 So, total due April 15th
 new tax bill $131,000 $250,000
 earned first quarter. thing would point out-MR. MULLINS.

 MR. LINDSEY. process tax bill, got

 April 15th another 20 percent first-quarter's income,
 meaning would working three-fourths first

 Maybe rich
 
 really different, anyone kind cash flow
 constraints send 75 percent income Uncle

 probably going help economy quite bit first

 another calculation. people go

 instead $131,000 that's 60 percent first-quarter

 think somewhat interesting numbers; don't
 know they're going affect small business sector.
 lot debate it. Again, there's behavior anything
 else; it's simply cash flow issue.
 personal anecdotal survey people
 affected tax bill underestimated much they're going
 pay. millionaire, example, see federal taxes go
 33 percent next year. people I've talked figure taxes
 think surprise
 going go 10 15 percent.
 magnitude next April 15th something may affect economy.
 that, Mr. Chairman, think Greenbook
 right.

 it's difficult enthusiastic kind performance.
 looks little better, maybe, average fourth quarter
 first quarter think one.
 might look even
 better, although much Greenbook forecast, take
 second quarter third quarter together, withhold
 judgment that. Certainly, look second quarter
 closely, positive picture.
 Spending hold quite
 well. Despite talk consumer pessimism, consumer
 spending advanced almost 4 percent annual pace; personal
 saving rate dropped again. continue hear talk
 business pessimism concerning spending hiring. Business fixed
 investment advanced 13 percent annual rate second quarter
 amid pessimism. payroll employment, continue hear
 weak, running 2 million job pace year, double
 number jobs added last year, view provide
 measure downside protection. Even jobs aren't great,
 unemployment rate almost percentage point lower
 last year time.
 It's 6.8 percent 6.85 percent; exCalifornia it's 6.4 percent guess that's unfair. recent
 evidence housing bit mixed, balance suggests

 homebuilders' assessments current sales. Even though starts

 So, think hard evidence still consistent
 moderate growth, we've six quarters [averaging] 2-1/2 percent.
 Nonetheless, perhaps clouds horizon least
 hints haze appeared scene. first auto
 story. little easing auto sales. think
 first sign hard spending data perhaps something
 going on. Now, special story--the inventory shortage.
 It's also true, think staff pointed out, non-auto

 must admit extreme form product substitution:

 can't find car you're looking for, buy sofa.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 [Laughter]
 
 long it's convertible couch!
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 don't answer that! Still, think
 auto easing may first sign something going on.
 warning sign continues-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. question
 seasonalities these.
 look patterns, it's clear.
 MR. MULLINS. Yes.
 We've four five consecutive

 there's enough noise going enough parts country

 People buying cars

 Now, current conditions index

 respect inflation, think two useful
 perspectives:
 path contemporaneous inflation mediumto longer-term outlook. respect contemporaneous inflation,
 difference meeting makes!
 last time said good news
 inflation low two past three months;
 it's four past five months. Al mentioned, core CPI
 2.4 percent past five months compared 4.6 percent
 previous five months.
 Inflation 10-month period
 since end third quarter last year 3-1/2 percent.
 pattern acceleration deceleration period
 couple quarters also generally reflected broadbased inflation measures even reflected commodity prices,
 albeit different timeframe you'd expect. think
 consistent speed effects interacting expectation effects.
 Indeed, wonder whether speed effects inherently "expectative;"
 may two separate things going there.
 good
 news, think bad news inflation apparently settled
 3 3-1/2 percent range. somewhat higher,
 perhaps 1/2 percent higher, would expected earlier
 year; keeps alive medium-term issue
 alignment rates.
 Chairman said nothing targeting real interest
 rates, would agree they're simply amenable
 targeting. think looking real rates provides rough conceptual
 framework provides insight things, one could say,
 edges it. look issue today still see

 since inflation receded there's evidence harm currently--no
 compelling evidence damage yet, building pressures credit

 currently observable pressures doesn't give much comfort
 [given] policy lags. saw quickly slack disappear

 adjustments well.
 So, looking medium term, still think it's

 substantial adjustment timed flawless precision avoid

 decision inflation continues collapse. think likely

 episode useful quite successful. don't know
 would go far suggest upturn inflation yielded

 need read assessments economists market participants
 perhaps look record low 30-year implied forward rates
 demonstrate we've educated market. may strain credibility

 that. may made inroads well, though; least
 message delivered. involved seem better
 understanding Fed's attitude toward inflation, commitment
 price stability; understand find 3-1/2 4
 percent inflation acceptable. Even though shots actually
 fired, think laid useful groundwork episode.
 I'd close saying may bit tricky
 months ahead. upturn inflation response, Tom
 mentioned, likely preempted talk expectations Fed ease

 Real estate beginning stabilize; banks

 we've heard last minutes. We've good

 seems last winter's inflation surge temporary. I've
 learned new danger didn't know called
 "speed" effect. disappointing news
 sense that, least case, expected real economic activity
 improve quickly strongly has. So, realities
 don't seem changed much. However slowly
 torturously, economy continue improve. Inflation
 seems trendless, albeit much high level. So,
 moment least, guess would summarize saying: nice
 vacation. We're going work soon, I'm sure.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, economy
 Second District weakened slightly recent weeks probably
 best described bumping along trough. passage
 budget deficit bill following military base closings June
 likely add downward pressure coming months. labor
 markets weak. Employment state New York declined
 14,000 jobs June, 51,000 jobs shed New Jersey.
 New York declines manufacturing employment New
 Jersey spread throughout whole economy. Retail sales
 mixed. firms lower end market
 prices rather well firms selling higher ticket
 items rather poorly. budget bill going
 affect Second District fairly negatively. lot neighbors,
 especially lower Manhattan, make great deal money
 would fit Governor Lindsey's explanation. addition, cuts
 top base closings bill especially affect New York,
 New Jersey, Connecticut. So, rather negative tone area
 made somewhat worse recent developments.
 national level, believe Greenbook forecast
 essentially right on. area fact agree
 analysis [where] somewhat concerned strength
 export markets seen Japan Europe may slightly
 overstated. think political leadership Japan going
 concentrate almost exclusively electoral reform little
 economy. it's difficult exaggerate degree
 political dismay
 Europe. Although think forecast economies
 Greenbook best bet, there's risk it, think risk
 [the forecast] overstated; could mean net
 exports would even bit weaker. offset would
 reduction price pressures.
 market developments, think it's fascinating
 2- 30-year spread close yesterday 235 basis points
 whereas long time spread 3 full percentage
 points. spread reflects inflationary expectations, must
 ask reduced them. It's difficult see
 deficit reduction bill reduced significantly
 recent past. certainly least quarters
 breath relief perils Pauline ended lady
 rescued railroad track bill passed.
 economic effects bill largely discounted.
 
 -26-
 
 8/17/93
 
 believe quite firmly reduction spread come
 two factors:
 One, general expectation economic growth
 moderate; perhaps importantly move asymmetric
 directive part Committee recent HumphreyHawkins testimony. Even though hiccup rates
 events hit news, market absorbed significance
 actions Committee think positive effect
 level interest rates yield curve
 useful educational effect inflationary expectations.
 expectations essentially psychological fact
 asymmetric directive Humphrey-Hawkins testimony also
 largely psychological view important
 constructive offsetting effect. We've done work New York
 Bank comparison real interest rates present time
 similar point history, August 1977.
 [earlier] time real fed funds rate zero or, one wants
 exact, -0.2 percent.
 real interest rates considerably
 lower. Although core inflation rate time 6.2 percent,
 average prime rate month 6.8 percent. Now,
 core inflation rate of, let's say, 3.3 percent prime rate
 6 percent. go yield curve, real
 interest rates present time considerably higher
 then. That, think, two effects.
 One, contributes
 explanation top feel households corporations
 restructure balance sheets. note
 effect taking debt quite expensive real terms,
 would another factor relatively slow growth.
 hand, still indicates inflationary expectations
 great deal higher believe Committee find
 acceptable satisfactory. educational effort
 we've engaged in--and rather successfully recent months-it would indicate educational efforts still lying
 ahead us.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Well, think I'm middle here;
 certainly seeing slow moderate growth matter slice
 it. labor market seeing improvement, really
 slightly handling demographics. quality much
 job growth good. Restructuring clearly
 continuing. Consumer confidence, think, taking toll. We're
 seeing hesitant consumers confidence problems spreading
 business sector hesitance investment patterns.
 potential home owners, we've seen much growth housing
 sector think fundamentals would suggest. Weak international
 trading partners, defense downsizing, deficits--federal
 state--are going continue drag. haven't talked much
 around table today state deficit problems, may
 hearing upcoming quarter. Then, course,
 there's realization budget package
 passed. Larry demonstrated, people really going
 understanding tax package meant. And, course, still
 work flood problems still health care
 horizon. So, lot factors contributing
 outlook slow growth.
 
 8/17/93
 
 -27-
 
 Now, said that, shouldn't forget miss
 strengths economy could bode well long
 run. financial markets really reasonably strong:
 equity
 market strong; bond market strong. Banks better
 shape individual balance sheets better shape.
 least focus trying solve deficit problem. can't say
 I'm confident current package thing
 that's going solve it, least seems focus
 fact something needs done it.
 number anomalies think we're going
 address coming months. question
 productivity. haven't heard mentioned today, fall-off
 productivity first half year seems anomalous me,
 given downsizing focus efficiency. don't know
 bad harbinger it's going go away.
 persistence low real interest rates, least short-term real
 interest rates, doesn't seem like something continue forever.
 can't stable situation. weakness dollar
 another anomalous situation. Certainly M2 remains another anomaly.
 I, like Tom, bit uncomfortable don't clear focus
 monetary policy. So, hope continue work way
 toward trying define happening M2 long
 temporary factors going temporary. Maybe inflation fits
 category anomaly. I've certainly encouraged
 recent news--the fact recent inflation report
 last 12-month core inflation number lower previous
 12-month number. So, still possibility making
 progress, shouldn't think progress going
 anywhere near good last year so.
 don't
 see possibility big outbreak inflation. usual indicia
 simply present:
 don't see overheated economy; cost-push
 pressures aren't significant, look slack labor
 markets; we're importing inflation; people aren't rushing
 convert real assets.
 So, I'm little encouraged
 inflation. But, again, fact settling 3
 3-1/2 percent range, can't satisfied that. So, may
 still work ahead us.
