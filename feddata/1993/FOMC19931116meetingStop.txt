 MR. KOHN. questions existing
 transcripts release information regarding deliberations
 future meetings involve subtle complex considerations.
 background discussion matters, staff supplied
 series options. Obviously, didn't exhaust
 possibilities, thought ones listed would highlight
 main issues confront.
 options presented two groups--one disposition
 existing transcripts release information

 may interact other. critical consideration effect
 options chosen deliberative process going forward.
 Therefore, decision concerning disposition past transcripts
 doesn't necessarily mandate actions going forward. example,
 could decide release transcripts, edited not, going back
 time, without necessarily committing future.
 Virgil outlined legal considerations bearing
 decisions, Committee past debated
 extensively effects various options monetary policy

 arguments well known Committee won't repeat

 so, parts not.
 Perhaps cleanest approach would
 staff editing transcripts past meetings
 without review participants.

 FOMC, reviewed participants, likely contained
 errors transcription. Since would official records,
 FOMC could consider publishing officially, rather
 making available interested parties.
 Options meetings going forward presented Roman II

 first option would Committee continue
 release turn recorder. tapes
 transcripts prepared could discarded National

 alternative taping transcribing, Secretariat would need
 take notes use preparation Minutes; possible
 notes would subject Records Act. quality
 Minutes might suffer extent--depending extent

 occasions questions arise. Finally, option
 chosen, Committee would need consider repercussions

 Alternative two--enhanced minutes--might help ameliorate

 several forms. one suggested outline would

 wonder edited transcript

 like sort thing sensitive parts government would
 whereas MOD sounds bit sanitized, safer

 sounds bit like minutes--not think big
 difference--and might marginally harder defend come

 MOD opposed something like edited transcript going forward

 negligible; practical purposes MOD

 It's frankly easier read
 many respects, purpose scholarly, probably
 useful public. you're asking strong
 opinions, that's-MR. MULLINS.
 
 that's based upon strong opinion?

 No.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. three general points I'd like make
 I'll cover thoughts ought do.
 first point
 past practice separated
 future. made point agree it.
 First all,
 think existence transcripts used general
 purposes FOMC beyond preparation policy record
 minutes, depending called point time,
 require continue tape transcribe. Secondly,
 think President's new policy respect FOIA cause

 words,
 significant change; regardless may going terms
 general legislative debate FOMC disclosure, cause
 us review we're doing.
 It's unclear outcome
 litigation would respect MOD. Even taping
 transcribing, possibility FOIA request tapes
 transcripts, would effect freeze process. Now,
 appreciate Virgil said position have,
 really don't know litigation going come out. would
 overhanging deliberative process considerable

 time fought courts.
 So, really, way
 protect tapes, transcripts, forth going forward
 legislation. That's way sure deliberative
 process protected.
 second general point think need resolve
 today want respect release information
 past meetings. that.
 importance decisions respect future meetings may want
 consider decide later, albeit promptly--in
 mind certainly later December meeting.
 third point general matter think would
 desirable public information point view consider
 something future provides greater disclosure without
 adversely affecting deliberative process.
 I'll get
 briefly end.
 respect past meetings, Alan, favor
 recommended:
 lightly edited transcripts five-year lag.
 would inclined release 1988 early 1994
 could establish schedule release earlier
 ones, would really determined availability staff
 prepare them. I'd make available according
 predetermined schedule. people said, think would
 open MOD looking back would think cost
 considerably reasonable. I'd favor review Secretariat
 staff interest getting information timely
 basis. one final point respect releasing
 five-year lag:
 precedent old MODs
 ought look terms setting timeframe; five years
 would consistent [with past practice].
 respect future meetings, would favor current
 approach keeping minutes. Don, don't know alternative
 yours; guess would alternative one, current
 minutes taping transcript notes
 Secretariat staff made connection preparing minutes
 disposed approval minutes. would be, view,
 normal practice sort function. general view
 FOMC ought held accountable decisions,
 details deliberations. view minutes
 adequate regard include details individuals
 voted. Secondly, procedure taping transcribing
 required way. effect, convenience
 Secretariat staff. raises questions
 touched respect retention records--tapes
 transcripts--under Federal Records Act. Third, think tapes
 transcripts, I've said before, would subject FOIA
 litigation [would result in] considerable uncertainty overhanging
 Committee period time.
 Finally, pointed
 out, tapes transcripts would subject immediate Congressional
 subpoena, would form oversight goes well beyond
 semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony could raise questions
 financial markets Fed's independence. Another point
 approach, think considerable advantages,
 legislation would required order make sure
 deliberative process protected going forward.
 
 11/16/93
 
 -26-
 
 final point would be, touched
 beginning, think public information sense need
 take steps open consider things either
 enhanced minutes prompt release directive connection
 approach laid out.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, certainly agree
 general thrust recommendations. Going forward agree
 MOD best way go three- five-year lag.
 know there's huge difference MOD edited
 transcript but, frankly, fairly strong preference MOD.
 would eliminate lot extraneous commentary think would
 make atmosphere better. would way minimize
 negative impact deliberative process edited
 transcript might entail.
 Going backward, past, also agree
 recommendation. strong feeling
 privacy issue.
 think predecessor 20 years
 here. trying avoid release transcripts going
 make look we're trying hide something. fact
 don't anything hide, least nothing hide
 lasting significance view. great advantage
 releasing transcripts makes point clearly
 emphatically puts us better position deal
 think real threat here, opportunity
 situation presents people want paint us secretive
 manipulative interested issues concern rather
 many. need act decisively keep kind
 sentiment check think that's central threat
 problem here.
 far particulars concerned, would
 release transcripts. Along lines Governor Angell's
 recommendation, would release lightly edited version
 make intelligible also unedited version make clear
 we're using editorial process hide anything. far
 length lag time concerned, came meeting
 thinking probably three years right amount time.
 argument five years makes sense but, frankly, I'm
 sure would buy much additional privacy going five years
 three years bit forthcoming. finally, far
 review process concerned--I think discussed briefly
 memo, Don--it would nice take route give people
 participated meetings opportunity make comments
 review them. think speed essence; we're going
 forthcoming, need move quickly. don't think
 unless restrict review FOMC Secretariat, would
 go approach.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. Thank you. like idea explaining
 position Committee Congress hope
 pursue way explain dimensions this.
 past, frankly, think it's wrong ever release transcripts
 meetings people didn't know made time,
 doesn't seem option. first choice would along
 
 -27-
 
 11/16/93
 
 lines suggested Tom Hoenig's question prepare Memoranda
 Discussion past release raw transcripts
 doesn't give us protection--if
 Archives 30 years.
 judgment that's going it--then proposal
 lightly edited transcripts sort third best that's
 we're stuck with.
 Going forward first choice would enhanced minutes
 tape transcripts, Don's number 2, frankly think
 chance getting away stopping taping transcribing
 we've 17 years likely
 successful.
 question Memoranda Discussion versus
 lightly edited transcripts released lag think
 decided along lines Dave Mullins suggested, one
 likely withstand protection without legislation.
 comes side lightly edited would favor that;
 otherwise would favor Memoranda Discussion. Certainly
 legislation, would prefer Memoranda Discussion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think it's important
 discussion keep mind you've already indicated
 thrust we're talking today

 really long enough; preference would five-year lag.
 And, I'm mistaken, believe lag previous

 Governor LaWare.
 
 MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, fully subscribe
 proposition making available [Banking] Committee edited

 find sensitive. I'm less concerned time lag.
 seems
 three years retrospective part adequate. though
 haven't addressed specifically, don't think it's practical
 go back try get every living person ever participated

 would let
 staff editing. don't think could possibly justify
 mind trying Memorandum Discussion
 ancient meetings person attempting simply
 wouldn't proper environment interpret

 [going forward] side strongly favor Memorandum
 Discussion simply accuracy. read,
 example circulated, kind gibberish one
 transcripts contains.
 It's almost impossible tell individuals
 really trying say given speech. leads
 favor releasing edited raw transcript
 seems somebody raise question
 whether interpreted bit gibberish correctly. So, think
 edited transcripts retrospectively right; prospectively

 -30-
 
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 couple general points.
 We've
 talked lot deliberative process morning
 important quality decisionmaking process.

 think it's important underscore deliberative process
 evolved long period time; made day
 meeting one generation Open Market Committee people. one
 undermine weaken process much quickly
 took us get point is.
 So, look
 short-run issues also longer-run view
 effectiveness.
 second general point deliberative process
 unique Federal Reserve.
 Executive Branch
 independent agencies effective deliberative process
 every major public policy decision. make general
 statement, I'm sure others factually aware it,
 suspect kinds things talking today
 applied rest public policy decisionmaking units
 city throughout Executive Branch would give great deal
 trouble also carrying kinds quality decisions
 make. think one make case central banking
 different, don't want different side
 less environment deliberative [others making]
 public policy. think would helpful us compared
 practices elsewhere Washington own; may
 much outlier think are. way moving
 may fact result short-changing ability deliberate
 compared agencies.
 said that, deal [issues at] hand.
 general proposed, Mr. Chairman, makes sense me.

 think going back five years lightly edited transcript
 way go.
 would go back ask everybody part
 sign off. would time-consuming probably
 effective process. document ought say staff
 used best judgment; may errors it,
 is.
 ought move releasing quickly can,
 given resources.
 Going forward, think general proposition makes
 sense. Nevertheless, went back first time long
 time actually reread parts Memorandum Discussion
 compared lightly edited transcript, great
 deal difference. recollection Memoranda Discussion
 somewhat shorter somewhat summarized,
 going back reading one seems isn't lot
 difference. support Memoranda Discussion
 going forward, since lot problem one perception--and
 almost surely defend FOIA suit time
 future--I wonder ought err marginally side
 openness.
 could easily accept, fact marginal

 Obviously, think would substantial harm

 It's difficult try put

 Ideally would like

 process we're harboring secrets think
 harboring secrets files--documents kept secret

 politically feasible way avoid this.
 first preference, clearly,
 process extensive minutes--enhanced minutes
 capture full discussion, including issues
 arguments without attribution. I'd release immediately,
 six weeks meeting, whatever time takes produce it.
 think could managed Federal Records Act.
 Basically would taping would note-takers.
 note-takers also would avoid giving attribution. Now,
 political process compare that--basically full discussion
 [in form enhanced minutes without attribution] produced
 quickly--with MOD promise full discussion
 attribution later, seems [significant] difference
 attribution. reason one would prefer
 attribution bust open process find who's
 early on. certainly may objective
 harshest critics. it's clear bulk Congress
 would favor that, especially I've seen little interest

 Now, maybe it's unfeasible try given
 today, least ought consider stakes. Given
 stakes, seems might worth try. Essentially
 believe we're sufficient else wouldn't

 Shouldn't

 Nonetheless, willing accept reluctantly summary judgment

 seems highly likely sooner later busted open.
 think process damaged. also would support
 consideration change timing release
 directive. think [the delayed release] us much greater public
 political harm terms perceptions possibly value.
 think it's time reweigh pluses minuses.
 Now, enhanced minutes idea simply feasible,
 would prefer past edited transcripts [a lag of]

 points. One reiterate said earlier:

 decide--

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, intention moving
 forward vote close.
 MR. MELZER. point wanted make--and reasonable
 people differ this--is don't feel much
 flexibility change going forward do.
 [If decide]
 go MOD now, would announcing publicly. think
 perception would we've moved toward disclosure
 think it's appropriate; Congress certainly feel
 it's appropriate. Then, within short period time--months
 even years--we decided didn't think appropriate
 more, doubt [a change] would accepted well.
 [The
 perception would that] made move toward openness

 MR. TRUMAN. briefly state play follows:
 know, last week put place, sense ready

 Bank Mexico, favorable behavior financial
 markets wasn't necessary use that. Meanwhile,
 working Bank International Settlements backing
 central banks put place contingency
 package
 [United State's] participation would $6

 existing swap line $700 million Peter referred
 special swap arrangement $2.3 billion. aim put
 place contingency basis tomorrow--to ready go
 sometime 8:00 p.m. Eastern standard time things turn
 poorly, anything unless things go poorly
 Mexicans decide activate arrangement. connection
 would request maintain contact Norm Bernard, telling

 might give Norm proxy. hope Mexicans' hope too,
 obviously, none necessary go

 Contacts report shortage construction workers Phoenix
 Tucson experiencing building boom rapidly appreciating home

 note companies moving
 Tucson area like Hughes Aircraft. Similarly, contact Portland
 reports three major new office buildings planned

 Finally, western Washington's economy slowed

 eastern part state reporting boom.
 turn moment national economy,
 basically agree Greenbook's outlook moderate growth
 real GDP next two years tighter fiscal policy
 counterbalanced relatively low real interest rates. However,
 bit surprised Greenbook shows small decline
 inflation next year year after.
 Given expectation
 output grow modestly next two years
 unemployment rate likely remain roughly present level,
 based upon past relationships wouldn't surprising view
 see labor market slack size reduce CPI inflation
 lower number included Greenbook.

 I'd like take opportunity congratulate Bob

 respect national picture, upward revision
 Greenbook projection current quarter certainly seems
 reasonable, given broad evidence aggregate demand may
 heating bit.
 Frankly, wouldn't terribly surprised see
 something even excess 4 percent one quarter. also
 continue believe risk error Greenbook projection
 '94 least somewhat side. recognize, Mike
 Greenbook rightly point out, recent tendency consumer
 spending outrun income growth sustainable long
 haul. context permanent income model consumer
 behavior, think one interpret recent behavior perhaps
 indicating households revised upward thinking
 future income prospects. that's correct interpretation,
 it's quite possible increase demand sustained well
 wouldn't surprised see real GDP growth next
 1994.
 year 3 percent perhaps even bit higher, compared 2-1/2
 percent projection Greenbook. regard, recent
 backup long-term interest rates is, money least,
 discouraging development recently. think it's primarily due
 concern markets recent strengthening economic
 activity going allowed point put upward pressure
 inflation. sense perception increasingly
 widespread. know, nothing could hurt recovery

 think need remain vigilant.

 also talk Fed tightening markets

 don't think sustained moderate economic growth

 still strong. Economic growth crashing resource
 constraints would certainly concern staff, still
 measure slack. investment boom productivity growth
 suggest prospect growth without concerns. again,
 growth fast businesses workers feel free seek price
 wage increases, possibility Bill McDonough mentioned, would
 cause concern.
 think evidence [of apparent];
 example, look closely purchasing managers' reports,
 price diffusion index still 50 percent. sense
 competitive conditions remain tight although there's possibility
 sort speed effect two good quarters.
 Inflation
 still seems marginally downward path. fundamentals,
 including disinflationary world economic environment, support
 prospect additional progress. fundamentals
 least would suggest progress Greenbook
 projecting, Bob Parry mentioned, given outstanding slack.
 said that, still believe maintain
 accommodative stance. long lags associated
 inflation necessarily job look future.
 wait inflationary pressures established evident,
 it's pretty late game. Mike Prell gave upside scenario;
 capacity utilization already 82 percent, might
 much room left especially think growth next year could
 easily 3 3-1/2 percent. Moreover, though, think objective
 ought continue make progress reducing inflation--core
 inflation run 3 percent past 12 months--in order
 secure sustainable low interest rate environment associated
 benefits.
 view objective simply avoid
 re-acceleration upturn inflation. think there's real
 payoff stabilizing inflation 3 4 percent range
 moving lower.
 Finally, think take markets seriously.
 long bond rate moved 40 basis points. There's legitimate
 question long wait long bond rate continues
 move up--how long artificially constrain short end.
 bond rate move up, we're going consider whether
 move short end might necessary beneficial confirm
 we're job limit damage inflationary
 expectations long end. all, still investmentdriven expansion, dependent long rate thrust.
 think ought sensitive risks associated
 maintaining accommodative stance long, including lost
 opportunity secure lower inflation. seem
 it's relatively early game. long bond rate 40 basis
 points seems stabilized it's still 30 basis points

 little increase implied forward rates long end
 curve; much intermediate.
 Nonetheless, considering switch
 accommodative neutral would note current favorable

 consider move time think many people would
 also simply say

 it's worth noting Administration forecast is, course,
 short rates go inflation next year. Thank you.

 MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm I've

 Corporate profits reasonably strong.

 little ironic we're seeing much acceptance growth

 said acceptable growth rate economy
 compared we've seen previous cycles. Now, going forward,
 maybe acceptable many folks would like, I'm
 hard time seeing we're going move much
 growth path. that's indeed Greenbook suggesting. Job
 growth strong enough lower unemployment. We're still
 question job quality, seems affecting confidence.
 question whether income growth we're
 seeing less increases spending thus whether
 [spending] sustained. We're seeing lower saving rate.
 still continuation [factors] we've
 talked past tend slow growth: restructuring,
 fiscal drag, on. I'm hard time seeing
 
 -86-
 
 11/16/93
 
 going move us much 2-1/2 maybe 3 percent growth rate.
 least it's slow moderate growth path.
 inflation front, we've seen continued progress
 reducing inflation, albeit rate improvement slowed down.
 Labor costs don't appear causing pressure. We've even seen
 decline unit labor costs productivity increases.
 clearly ways go inflation, seems
 proper approach keep eye ball

 We're seeing pressures, perhaps somewhat late,
 commodity prices taxes. seems reasonable appropriate
 focus keeping slope movement inflation going
 downward. I've really quite heartened recently see articles

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions Mr. Kohn?
 not, let
 get started. strikes part fits starts
 something going economy something
 going data. One way looking ask whether
 measures giving type volatility GDP data
 given.
 It's clear, example, gross domestic income-granted somewhat inferior measure--in exactly context
 good deal smoother GDP.
 It's also hardly credible,
 two independent estimates increasing work hours
 first half--both payroll household surveys--that
 productivity measured GDP, nonfarm business product,
 could gone down. It's credible economic phenomenon.
 leads one conclude recovery smoother
 data show raises interesting questions whether
 self-sustaining, number people commented on,
 whether significant breakout seem
 observing. certainly case industrial production
 shown definite strength late. November data,
 looking weekly numbers motor vehicles number
 related weekly industrial components, indicate [the] November
 [index] already significantly.

 obvious question ask is:
 that's going induce acceleration much beyond Greenbook
