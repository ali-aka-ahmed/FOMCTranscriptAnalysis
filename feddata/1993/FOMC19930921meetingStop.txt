 concludes
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd like raise question
 Mike Ted. discussed briefly last night interesting
 path long-term rates relative simplistic model. There's
 interesting question that's implicit this; namely, if,
 fact, primitive model, one could postulate could
 drive funds rate zero, hold long
 period time--which physical capacity do--and
 therefore look forward significant decline long-term
 rates. Now, obviously, don't think anybody believes
 process would happen. raises interesting question
 whether relationships picked model
 
 9/23/93
 
 basically result fact short-term rates generally
 perceived significantly line productivity
 events surround short-term market eventually
 begin affect long-term market. long Federal
 Reserve endeavor force short-term rate away
 otherwise be, model merely reflecting fact
 forces affecting short-term rate ultimately affect
 long-term rate. seriously question whether infer
 sort relationship significant policy issue
 suspicion try drive relationship
 monetary policy, would automatically find day
 doesn't work more.
 curious get response
 [issue raised in] conversation last night.
 MR. PRELL. Well, think hypothesized situation
 consequences obviously explosive. held shortterm rates low long, initially term structure
 mechanism lowering cost capital equilibrium rate
 intermediate- long-term end, would generate excess demand
 inflationary pressures. inflationary pressures would mount
 time. Something would give; presumably point
 monetary policy would adjust proper direction. one
 reasons reservations model sense
 doesn't include place people recognize things
 headed forward-looking response. latter could
 introduce inflation premium earlier tend override
 model's formulation would suggest. perhaps didn't
 move patterns behavior model didn't kinds
 experiences estimate. So, grant likely
 limitations.
 didn't feel that, presumably would
 significantly different kind forecast. one thing
 gives pause, suggested, model worked
 remarkably well past, even past decade. noted
 fitted 1958 1983, even 1980s
 acute sensitivity inflation risks happened
 past, model tracked quite well. versions

 well].

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions either
 President Jordan.
 gentleman?
 MR. JORDAN. funds rate unchanged little
 year now. So, seems useful look back
 period see else unchanged changed
 direction try make sense it.
 reviewing
 successive Greenbooks period since year ago, one
 things struck little forecast nominal GDP
 second half 1994 changed. year ago time
 [extended forecast] another year, curious
 1995 projections look like get those, that's
 main question now. funds rate stayed 3 percent [your
 forecast for] nominal GDP growth still order 4-1/2
 percent little second half 1994; hasn't
 changed much even though lot things changed
 
 9/23/93
 
 Then, see estimates
 meantime successive Greenbooks.
 potential real output revised up, partly new
 benchmark numbers. Actual output somewhat
 anticipated continues projected low side '94,
 you've got bigger gap. two essential elements
 framework. One gap says something future inflation
 nominal and/or real interest rates say something real
 output growth. Bond yields lower anticipated
 earlier; don't know real rates, least nominal rates
 lower. Short rates inflation [is higher], suggesting
 lower real rates.
 So, ex ante, one would look set things
 say:
 Well, forecast implied split
 nominal GDP would less inflation output. Instead, get
 opposite. bigger gap yet lower output growth
 almost percentage point 1994, bigger gap
 higher inflation. I'd curious [to learn] things must
 changed, things equal would gotten
 opposite. would expected output, less inflation. So,
 things changed framework produce
 combination higher inflation lower output GDP?
 MR. PRELL. Well, President Jordan, that's kind
 complicated question I'd writing week
 advance, think, able justice answering it. don't
 think I've absorbed threads. have, obviously,
 forecast 1993 substantially less favorable mix output
 increase inflation. We've gotten much lower growth
 anticipated inflation running somewhat higher. Now,
 curiously, unemployment rate higher
 anticipated; lower, needs taken
 account well.
 Furthermore, looking revised national income
 account data actual growth estimate
 potential growth, output gap we've estimated tentatively
 point somewhat smaller thought, larger. actual
 growth revised estimate potential growth.
 So, sense gap exerting disinflationary pressure
 isn't larger thought; it's probably smaller. Furthermore,
 earlier year view response
 surge activity. think unwinding now, net thus
 far year don't think helpful.
 would really review lot detail able
 give better answer question, don't think basic
 model, sense works, changed. We've
 surprises. I've suggested regard current forecast
 see underlying confirmation scheme we've
 applying forecasting. led us little
 confident extend disinflationary trend going
 forward. think growth '95 remained moderate
 unemployment remained close it, would
 ongoing disinflation. seen quite favorable
 tradeoff anticipated, slack shade less
 average thus far.
 MR. JORDAN. follow up?
 stress fiscal package.
 
 expected put little
 
 9/23/93
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, don't think affected
 tradeoffs but, know, beginning year
 didn't introduce fiscal package uncertainties.
 introduced one included fiscal stimulus wanted
 follow President's lead this.
 Ultimately, nearterm fiscal stimulus package; fact, probably moved
 restraint forward time beyond anyone would anticipated
 earlier. substantial amount fiscal restraint
 forecast damping aggregate demand affecting
 unemployment/inflation tradeoff. Well, elements here,
 [such as] gasoline taxes; excise tax impact sense gives
 short-run deterioration tradeoff. things
 going could still happen tend
 raise price level short run relative everyone-MR. JORDAN.
 raises interesting implications
 Committee's policy second page Greenbook summary
 say "Achievement middling expansion path may require
 maintenance relatively low real short-term rates--to counter
 contractionary effects fiscal restraint, uncertainty
 government policies, and, least near term, slow growth
 foreign industrial economies."
 That's stronger statement--I would
 call advocacy--of monetary policy typically see
 Greenbook. Greenbook typically little neutral terms
 assumption monetary policy. it's case
 real output projection influenced fiscal actions,
 it's position Committee generally monetary policy
 cannot used correct mistakes parts government
 sector, advocate monetary policy future
 different would absence fiscal package,
 saying monetary policy adjusted
 fiscal regime.
 MR. PRELL. Well, two things one could say. One
 monetary policy can't adjusted offset shocks
 change fiscal policy. don't think there's economic basis
 statement. may difficulty
 can't anticipate precision occurring without shift
 monetary policy uncertainties also
 effects monetary policy change be. So,
 uncertainties may lead think might desirable
 attempt engage fine-tuning. Certainly Committee
 recent decade one way another repeatedly made
 statement realizes would impossible fully
 effective fine-tuning would risks
 attempting that.
 terms advocacy, would view statement
 positive statement normative statement. simply says
 wanted achieve growth path, might require low real
 short-term interest rates longer span. didn't advocate
 particular outcome. That's clearly Committee's decision make.
 [It's Committee] weigh risks might attend
 policy movement policy movement terms whether
 might end less output inflation whatever
 desire. We're attempting neutral possible taking
 essential assumption nominal funds rate remains fixed.
 aren't advocating necessarily; taking
 
 9/23/93
 
 baseline giving something adjust based whether
 feel risks different fundamentals going
 push things stronger easier direction.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mike, projection real personal
 consumption expenditures third quarter, given high July
 level, implies decline average August September,
 calculated right. right?
 MR. PRELL. marginal increase September
 PCE. see pretty healthy gain third quarter
 data already hand. Real consumer goods expenditures
 motor vehicles seem well level third quarter,
 service expenditures running strong early summer.
 So, think likelihood strong advance there. see
 flattening out, arithmetically works direction
 moderate increase fourth quarter. basing
 income trends attitudes factors one
 might look explaining prospects consumption
 expenditures.
 GOVERNOR GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 Ted, NAFTA [assumption]?
 
 MR. TRUMAN. continued NAFTA assumption
 we've past, legislation pass.
 noted Greenbook light recent noise, may put
 way, may somewhat less "gimme" putt
 regarded earlier. thought bit implications
 might be, largely--at least short term--revolve
 around impact Mexico, secondary impact United
 States. seen year Mexican growth slowed
 substantially. appears us combination tighter
 policies Mexico face rising current
 account deficit uncertainties associated NAFTA
 level capital inflows. Therefore, next year, assumption
 NAFTA would pass, moved Mexican growth somewhat
 percentage point.
 absence [NAFTA], regard
 increase growth problematic--I think that's way put
 Greenbook. Moreover, think would downward
 pressure peso and, therefore, would drag
 exports United States result failure NAFTA.
 That's far we've gone.
 MR. ANGELL. two questions Mike. Mike,
 look interest rate forecasts place
 look ECI numbers page I-14 Greenbook, I'm wondering
 happens pension contributions. period
 interest rates behave forecast, assuming
 end 1994 might upward pressure short-term
 rates, would make much difference regard impact
 ECI pension plan fundings come pressure--that is, given
 assumptions rates return built in?
 
 9/23/93
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, we've alluded problem last
 couple Greenbooks great deal discussion
 recent weeks press, investment
 banking firms Salomon Brothers calling attention
 issue. appears large number corporations
 serious risk major underfunding defined benefit
 pension plans kinds investment returns.
 They've
 optimistic maintaining high expected returns, [i.e.]
 assumptions they've used determining contributions.
 They're
 going significant pressure make realistic.
 would expect upward pressure
 component employment costs. likely gigantic
 effect. don't really good enough handle size this,
 feel there's probably something significance
 buoying increases benefit costs. items may
 coming down, overall deceleration seems likely limited
 factor.
 MR. ANGELL. time, persons retired
 approaching retirement counting short-term funded
 investments, likely current continued downward
 pressure consumer spending segment due fact
 perceived reduction investment income?
 MR. PRELL. think it's possible. It's also possible--I
 don't think much evidence, though I've asked businessmen
 whether perceive this--that people may opt early
 retirement degree recent years
 may lowered expectations assets earn
 way income retirement years. don't think
 see anything yet labor force participation data support
 notion, things may work direction. may see
 tendencies toward little less 55 64 year old male
 retirement we've seen recent years.
 MR. ANGELL. last question statement
 regard substantial fiscal restraint. Substantial wasn't exactly
 word used some-MR. PRELL.
 
 might have.
 
 MR. ANGELL. --adjective regarding fiscal restraint. Yet
 one looks Congressional Budget Office forecast think
 even own, budget deficit doesn't change much
 forecast period. recognize deficit staying around $250
 billion would [constitute] declining percentage GDP, I'd like
 explain call "substantial" fiscal restraint.
 MR. PRELL. Well, numbers terms unified budget
 distorted year-to-year movements deposit insurance,
 drop, example, fiscal '93 fiscal '94 excluding
 deposit insurance programs order $40 billion. look
 NIPA budget deficit numbers, we're going get something like
 $80 $90 billion reduction deficit two-year span
 roughly constant levels resource utilization. look
 structural budget deficits, CBO numbers OMB
 numbers show flattening go several years, near
 term couple years fairly substantial reductions
 
 -8-
 
 9/23/93
 
 structural deficit. measure fiscal impetus, looking
 discretionary components, indicates significant movement
 direction restraint.
 think direction pretty clear,
 gauging economic significance always problematic. interpret
 things suggesting period going '94
 maybe well '95 direction fiscal policy one
 significant restraint.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 Could ask refer back
 interest rate model discussed presentation
 whether policy implication regarding relatively small
 changes fed funds rate?
 one say would
 merit easing, would appear model would say
 still considerable bang 3 percent fed funds rate buck
 transmitted time, model suggests,
 lower medium- long-term interest rates. hand,
 increase fed funds rate by, say, 25 basis points,
 model suggest change expectations could rather
 significant effect real economy restraining investment
 effect medium- longer-term rates?
 MR. PRELL. No. said, simple model;
 small upward movement going begin process altering
 moving average, model reaches back several years.
 So, it's going major effect. think ask
 whether model something want rely reaching
 judgment, though. questions low rates
 go order get outcome want fast want
 get there? want patient? believe rates
 might [move] model suggesting, quick enough you?
 Would rather accelerate process cutting rates further,
 knowing ultimately probably going reverse
 course dramatically road order move real rate
 levels something appropriate terms longerrun equilibrium? small adjustment, terms model,
 going essentially meaningless.
 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. rather slow decline
 unemployment rate Greenbook forecast there's decline
 now.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. PARRY. included upward revision
 growth trend productivity higher potential output well.

 one looks growth rates, real growth rates appear
 roughly equal cases growth rate potential.
 small progress made inflation area? think
 mentioned health care, gasoline taxes, etc., seems
 though it's surprisingly small progress.
 
 9/23/93
 
 MR. PRELL. Okay, let address couple things
 briefly. One that, gauging now, believe
 reasonable estimate potential output growth time perhaps
 shade 2-1/2 percent. So, it's close growth rate
 output projecting. so,
 things equal, one would expect unemployment rate reasonably
 stable. short-run uncertainties labor force
 remained weak side, one might
 participation.
 anticipate lower unemployment rate.
 rejuvenated suddenly,
 unemployment rate could easily go higher. I'd say, looking various
 models, slight upside risk unemployment.
 inflation forecast, basically we've
 3-1/4 percent past year core CPI.
 see edging
 3 percent next year so.
 line various models look at. would give
 deceleration less.
 bit less favorable
 hoping year ago, say, least beginning
 year. remain concerned certain momentum
 supplied expectations, still adjusted downward
 among households, appear 3 percent area. think
 part disinflation process gradual adaptation
 expectations kind inflation; near term tends
 keep wage increases little higher would otherwise be.
 think we're reasonable middle ground, given uncertainties
 feel.
 Based experience past year so,
 think would little aggressive point lower
 forecast further.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. We've probably talked enough model,
 thought I'd kick times well. bothers
 it's sort transparently nonsensical violates enormous
 evidence accumulated way markets work,
 [including] market efficiency. don't think one needs extreme
 circumstances realize model may capture happening
 period. can't happening [now].
 take
 continue run model, backward-looking
 nature model, say, long rate pierces 5 percent.
 I've noticed Michigan mean inflation expectations often
 around 5 percent, basically real possibility model
 drive long real rates negative.
 MR. PRELL. would anticipate inflation outcome
 also similar we're forecasting, inflation
 expectations would come down. correct-MR. MULLINS.
 different ours.
 
 expectations market little
 
 MR. PRELL. I'm saying inflation remained
 low expectations adjusting continue so.
 MR. MULLINS. going ask this:
 Short rates

 measure inflation formation inflation expectations.
 Would take predictive power away model?
 Essentially we've gone period gradually falling
 inflation expectations, little turn up, associated
 upward movement short-term rates reduction
 model inflation
 gradual [unintelligible].
 expectations see whether interest rate model anything
 driving it, would get?
 MR. PRELL. Well, can't speak
 experimentations done years this.
 current model,
 minimal role inflation expectations term
 structure determination. it's [the model in] arcane
 fashion. possible model hypothesize might
 serviceable, suspect experimented enough
 formulation proven robust. think saying model
 nonsensical totally odds reality runs point

 theoretically long time, worked. don't
 want push far.
 MR. MULLINS. reason say it's nonsensical
 doesn't make logical sense. know take short rate
 zero it's going work. get ridiculous answers
 model.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 Indeed.
 
 MR. MULLINS. Plus appears lack evidence
 way markets incorporate data available, makes
 one think picking process. one
 hears people talk set long rates, talk lot
 inflation long periods time. perhaps somehow
 capturing process. may good model implicitly
 capturing inflation expectations process.
 seems
 little questionable start reach levels;
 project going forward couple years, run danger
 getting pretty interesting [results].
 MR. PRELL. Let say couple things. One 5
 percent long-term rate, inflation moving 3 percent
 short-term rate around 3 percent, still looks like high long-term
 rate go back early 1960s. Now, that's people
 thinking, perhaps 3 4 percent inflation next X
 years--they probably thinking 1 2 percent [in real terms]
 inconceivable-MR. MULLINS. course, it's inconceivable get
 inflation level early '60s, 1
 percent measured CPI.
 MR. PRELL.

 case you'd looking maybe 4
 
 MR. MULLINS. Yes, move rate down.
 would say it's clear driving--

 MR. PRELL. Well, take minor issue that, think

 opposite?
 
 Well, survey data show
 
 MR. PRELL. people necessarily thinking
 precise way inflation next 10 years.
 They're saying "I can't stay 3 percent rates forever."
 saying maybe [rates] aren't going go back up,
 shift [of CDs like].
 model doesn't precisely
 specify psychology, it's compatible.
 MR. MULLINS. that's another theory don't know

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't.
 
 MR. MULLINS.

 thing would say look '70s, period
 perhaps short rates weren't appropriately set track

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Short data question:
 Coming back Bob
 Parry asked inflation, mandated programs come go
 going affect inflation--or inflict inflation, however one wants
 say it. meaningful number, put way,
 forecast stuff now?
 [unintelligible] terms being-MR. PRELL. Well, cumulatively, it's conceivable it's
 non-negligible. number things happened recent years
 we've various mandates added cost
 production one way another circumscribed supply. whether
 things increasing size trajectory means
 faster inflation recent years hard say.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 meant prospectively.
 
 MR. PRELL. Prospectively thing would hold. big

 don't expect program place end 1994.
 likely phased several years terms
 various costs. So, whether show sudden large boost
 costs isn't clear. I'm reminded another thing
 earlier forecast, based trial balloons whatever, we've
 taken out, minimum wage increase. kind minimum
 wage increase discussed going

 [measureable]?
 
 MR. PRELL. It's partly [such costs] aren't readily
 measurable terms aggregate price effects. bunch
 little things come along, may tend increase costs
 cases perhaps affecting willingness employers
 take full-time workers on. So, broad effects.
 one reasons rather subdued view aggregate
 demand going forward thought continuing

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions either

 President Forrestal.

 Finally, respect District, I've quite
 interested surprised NAFTA seems greater source

 And, unfortunately, seems support many quarters,

 Turning national economy, forecast near

 come little later. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, turning District, level
 economic activity seems much unchanged since last meeting.
 Still, underlying tone reports seems bit stronger,
 least terms volumes. automotive business continues
 surprisingly good pace. fourth-quarter production schedules
 set 11 percent last year. comparative sense,
 fourth quarter last year really quite strong one
 year's fourth quarter bodes pretty good one. retail
 inventories still good levels, long sales hold
 industry thinks downside risk production reasonably limited.
 automotive industry, therefore, expects activity
 plus terms fourth-quarter GDP. steel business
 continues strong pace given good first half had;
 best first half since 1981. [for] current level
 operations, they're running 87 percent capacity.

 So,
 expect shipments year come 87 88 million tons.
 terms production it's good year. aren't making
 money. October price increase announced earlier

 metal.
 Despite floods adversities agricultural

 weeks certainly going critical sector--the farm
 equipment business continues strong. company talked

 company Chicago, 15 years ago sales $1 billion
 53,000 employees, sales level currently $4 billion

 One change outlook find little interesting

 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, economic activity Twelfth
 District still weak, it's surprise indicate
 due largely poor conditions California. saw employment

 588,000 jobs lost state. It's also interesting
 note one back state national figures
 we'd probably unemployment rate 6.3 6.4 percent

 migration states rose 150,000 fiscal 1993.

 contrast, number legal foreign immigrants California rose 23
 percent 1992 record 237,500. Now, official estimate
 illegal immigrants 100,000; think that's really low. So,
 spite moves states, state's population
 growing rapidly.
 Conditions much better parts [District].
 fact, two states among top five nation
 terms growth rates, Utah Nevada. Homebuilding activity
 strong. number housing permits three-month
 period ended July 22 percent Idaho 35 percent
 Utah. Home prices rising dramatically. 1990 they're 27
 percent Boise, 18 percent Salt Lake City, 16 percent
 Las Vegas, 13 percent Reno. Manufacturing growth also
 strong outpacing national average many states.
 We've seen 4.3 percent growth manufacturing Idaho, 3.4 percent
 Nevada, 1.7 percent Utah.
 turn moment national economy:

 agree Greenbook pattern modestly accelerating growth
 decelerating inflation, I'd say I'm bit optimistic
 magnitudes 1994. We're expecting real growth
 bit more--not quite half percent--with somewhat less
 inflation. price side, factors--certainly one-time
 factors--are going effect tending raise CPI
 bit 1994, estimates we're going see greater
 improvement CPI indicated Greenbook.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, hasn't
 much change District period since last
 meeting. information we're receiving business contacts,
 directors, others indicates District's economy growing
 moderate pace. But, Bob Forrestal said, we've hit hard
 agriculture drought; we're coming
 outside agriculture things pretty much unchanged.
 elsewhere, people frustrated slow pace overall recovery;
 especially frustrated sluggishness job growth.
 don't think many people region think economy
 
 9/23/93

 turn back down. One sector seem seeing
 pretty consistent signs somewhat greater strength housing. Home
 sales, construction, new existing home prices seem
 rising local areas region.
 far national economy concerned, Greenbook's
 projection certainly reasonable plausible; objectively
 speaking risk error probably pretty evenly balanced
 side side, given know now. I've
 optimistic outlook recent months people
 guess people optimistic actual outcome.
 think optimistic people coming
 meeting, need little humble making conjecture
 future growth point. Nevertheless, would humbly
 submit may get somewhat stronger growth going forward
 staff expects.
 would make three points regard.
 First,
 Greenbook Beigebook seem suggest greater
 strength housing, said minute ago see
 District, pretty general across country. Greenbook
 points out, latest reports builders, lenders, home buyers,
 others market seem indicate housing outlook
 generally better latest data seem suggest.
 might extent substantiated increase housing
 August announced minute ago, Mike. light
 reports, given substantial decline mortgage rates,
 pickup housing seems going currently may turn
 robust sharper many people think. Second, think
 consumer spending looking increasingly solid. good rate
 increase real personal consumption expenditures second
 quarter and, given high level July--if calculated
 correctly--the third-quarter rate conceivably could close 4
 percent even relatively small increases months
 August September. finally, many people pointed out,
 job market conditions generally stronger weak August
 payroll figure would seem suggest. lengthening workweek,
 strength household survey data, continued fairly healthy
 rise help wanted advertising, suggest labor
 market least holding steady perhaps even improving bit.
 all, seems least one say
 private domestic final demand firming noticeably. Well,
 "noticeably" strong; guess one exert little effort
 notice it, think it's there. Activity undoubtedly
 continue restrained going forward forthcoming tax
 increases, employer concern cost implications health care
 reform, economic weakness many major export markets.
 still think balance there's better even chance
 get little growth 2.3 percent rate
 projected Greenbook second half year.
 One final point, may:
 view significant
 development far since last meeting decline
 long-term rates. One major objectives policy recent
 years, know, help bring long-term interest
 rates raising credibility efforts
 think much greater
 achieve price stability time.
 expected declines long rates recently evidence
 strategy working time. may evidence things
 
 -17-

 well, there's doubt actions recently aided
 decline long rates. hope whatever need
 going forward maintain extend progress. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. District continues
 grow modestly, I've said time time again. Construction
 remains reasonably good area mostly due housing, primarily
 western portion region Denver. Energy posted
 gains that's tied natural gas industry, still
 fairly active area. Banks' earnings extremely well;
 second quarter, nation, strong.
 fact, Oklahoma, think worst nation,
 banks earned second quarter something order 1-1/2
 percent assets. Oklahoma last week
 couple banks actually talking making loans!
 That's first
 time they've said almost decade. said wanted
 wait two quarters, though.
 [Laughter]
 I'm half kidding!
 service industry generally solid, although good
 nation. tourism important, it's little disappointing.
 Manufacturing really weak; durable goods employment actually
 declined last year region, 2-1/2 percent
 estimate, part aircraft industry.
 Prospectively region, expect terms
 slow growth. Low mortgage rates keep housing starts strong
 region, especially mountain area bit
 in-migration California going on. Agriculture report solid
 income, think, due importantly livestock prices; crop losses
 sufficient offset that, including [those associated
 with] effects flood drought, also
 freeze portions region. manufacturing,
 though, see nothing would show strong improvement
 region, think continue rather slow go
 forward.
 nation, expect moderate growth, everyone else
 does, although somewhat stronger Greenbook. also
 expect modest inflation, Greenbook.
 comes little stronger growth business fixed investment
 little accumulation inventories, basically see
 modest growth going forward. stronger growth
 projections, see employment little better
 Greenbook shows but, again, enough change view
 economy 1994.

 enormous overheating '70s '80s New England,

 [healing] still going on. see wage rate adjustment [and
 other] things happening. improvements areas.
 We've seen substantial improvement banking sector. Now,
 returns still numbers comparable national

 improvement bank willingness lend, think appropriate

 willingness lend, think actually new

 can't avoid, immediately anyway, fact

 absolutely important get it--is maximize real output.
 think we're about; unfortunately

 Another rumbling get around Wall Street

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Looking back last 18 months, data
 seem almost unbelievable. fact, one talks it's
 really hard believe. fact got 3.9 percent
 increase real GDP--which one talks would admit
 wasn't 4 percent--and cut literally half...!

 ways doesn't seem way. is, 1992 one really
 felt good things ways 1993 one feels
 bad things.
 [But] that's really quite significant step
 operating level fall back. makes
 disconcerting fact 1992 December December
 CPI 3.1 percent we've still got CPI running 3.1
 percent. Now, we're forecasting 1994, Q4 Q4, 2-1/2 percent,
 don't think anyone knows change number. one
 seems real good suggestions real good alternate numbers
 they've advocating. make even worse, revisions
 seem show productivity trends higher thought were.
 We've got productivity trends very, high; we've got ECI
 well behaved yet we're getting kind combination
 output price level response certainly seems desirable.
 wish could say economy faltered
 badly, yet guess. think corporate rationalization
 certainly factor. Certainly, FASB rules regard
 post-retirement health care benefits undoubtedly gave impetus
 
 -28-
 
 9/23/93
 
 downsizing employment. Certainly, pension plan underfunding
 seems probably already impacting large corporate
 employment plans. think us well aware
 disconcerting is. Apparently, many people jobs
 environment much aware fact jobs
 necessarily permanent. you'd think maybe we'd getting higher
 savings response somewhat conscious spending response yet
 numbers don't show all. don't see budge upward
 saving rate. So, all, domestic scene seems
 strange combination.
 look abroad, certainly [we see] impact
 economies Europe Japan; guess Federal Reserve staff
 members Committee agreed economies
 going weaker generally thought
 governments central banks countries. look
 stock market, guess would think downsizing
 rationalization efficiencies going on, profit numbers
 ought sustain kind equity prices see. yet
 ironically don't seem inflow abroad U.S.
 equity markets.
 Indeed, terms diversification, mutual fund
 investors United States seem ones
 buying equities Japan. So, gets pretty confusing

 MR. JORDAN. Don, chart package--I guess everybody got

 Since don't know

 MR. KOHN. It's true models also tracking
