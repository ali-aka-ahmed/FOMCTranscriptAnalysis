 MR. PRELL. Well, stage we'd probably see large

 think
 stage, given shedding labor occurred, we'd
 expect see larger proportion show actual employment

 versus numbers workers.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Numbers.
 
 MR. PRELL. Again, we'd expect show greater
 extent numbers workers rather lengthening
 workweek.
 MR. BOEHNE. That's question. see structural
 adjustments larger firms. However, talking people
 smaller businesses one gets impression really
 reluctance add people, obvious reasons,
 volume picked less would forced it.
 MR. PRELL. That's thrust remarks. I'm sure
 still elasticity many cases could [increase
 production] without adding workers. think getting
 closer margin and, presumption additional
 growth demand driven rather increase potential supply,
 we'd look additional hiring.

 MR. KELLEY. Mike, productivity growth

 less pace, projecting productivity

 MR. PRELL. Well, let emphasize broad historical
 perspective numbers don't constitute bad productivity

 But, suggested, working way economic factors,

 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, region country

 First all, would say employment picture
 mixed, fairly decent employment growth Kansas City area
 Colorado New Mexico, fairly poor employment growth
 parts region, particularly Oklahoma. Although
 case, optimism uniformly good even Oklahoma
 there's less job growth. lot efforts going forward
 encourage employment growth [possible].
 agricultural
 area, well know, increased livestock prices last year kept farm
 incomes higher originally expected. However, I'm pleased
 far land prices go, there's little speck renewed optimism
 stayed fairly flat. Construction activity
 strong, obviously helped along residential construction.
 though modest slowdown since November,
 construction levels still good 25 30 percent higher
 year ago. Manufacturing generally sluggish.
 stable environment auto industry, particularly GM
 there's lot uncertainty area. [activity at] Ford

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Thank you.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. terms projection overall, we're
 high end central tendencies except, course, unemployment
 we're low end. I'd make several observations
 projections. One point I've made [wide]
 confidence intervals think it's difficult basis
 make policy. that's particularly true respect timeframes
 inflation. inflation forecast '93, even though
 high end central tendency, still would call
 benign forecast. sense it's irrelevant
 impact policy prices much longer time lags area.
 aside, Mr. Chairman, you're thinking HumphreyHawkins testimony, given particularly read questioning

 confident we'll see continuing declines inflation

 District-wide we're seeing acceleration economic

 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, optimistic

 deficit reduction without reality. result got fall

 yet bite either tax increases spending cuts. I,
 gambler, would say deficit reduction package isn't going
 happen. get feeling everyone talk inside
 Beltway. I'm big believer conventional wisdom anything
 happens inside Beltway, that's we're talking
 here. First all, think Administration sincere. Mr.
 Panetta Mrs. Rivlin particular can't imagine sincere
 deficit cutters. Unfortunately, go list compare

 MS. PHILLIPS. Well, story probably going bit
 like Larry's, let start economic situation. Certainly
 strongest best prospects we've since I've
 Fed terms growth, production, productivity, spending.
 financial sector, something haven't discussed much, seem
 better shape, banking system financial

 strong stronger based fundamentals. variance
 among Districts, we've listened discussion,
 seems widening. report Bob Parry Twelfth
 District doesn't seem getting better. So, that's certainly
 disturbing wrinkle economic scene. John LaWare said,
 still continuing drags we've
 past. We're making progress, still [weakness in]
 non-residential construction, international slowdown may fact
 worse even we've led understand, federal deficit

 So,
 number kinds constraints we've seen before.

 about, clearly making progress don't think anybody really
 knows much much progress still make.

 America seems continuing. So, think we're going continue
 see pressures. think employment situation remains
 key sustainability [of economic growth]; it's certainly
 
 market watching now. People watching much what's
 happening new growth measures waiting
 employment reports. So, remains concern. I'm hopeful
 we're going get 130,000 month increase payroll
 employment, may bit optimistic.
 
 I'd like follow Larry's comments
 respect new Administration. watch [computer]
 screen couple hours, see trial balloons going across
 screen increasing rate. I'm certainly encouraged
 general direction new Administration taking respect
 trying address deficit [and enact] small fiscal
 package. Certainly stated goals something we'd like
 see happen terms jobs, deficit reduction, even banking
 reform. We're hearing discussion need examine

 February 3, 1993--Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. Let's continue
 [our agenda].
 Kohn brief us long-run ranges
 monetary aggregates.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. referring
 Bluebook course remarks.
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Don?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. Don, respect judgment good bit
 think you've approached reasonable way, given
 uncertainties.
 wonder, however, debating
 making case M2 might grow several percentage points
 higher estimate, would go making case?
 MR. KOHN. Well, first I'd like say think
 forecast 2 percent M2 growth 1993, given Greenbook
 forecast, balanced. wouldn't want leave impression
 think risk M2 come higher velocity
 lower. think I'd go making case higher M2 saying
 economy gets going, bank lending pick
 banks little aggressive seeking deposits.
 case might also made saying we've lot portfolio
 adjustments far. Time deposits running
 sticker shock aspect seeing new low rates time deposits
 wearing off, perhaps awful lot adjustment may
 behind us little ahead us. Also, banks
 rather prompt reduce deposit offering rates maybe
 rates won't coming quite much 1993 one ordinarily
 would think since they've done lot ahead time.
 every argument made could make counterargument.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. KOHN. One counterarguments might look
 first quarter. getting very, weak money growth;
 economy looks okay. And, anything, we're going get
 projections 7 percent plus velocity increases first quarter.
 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 MR. PRELL. Could add point discussed
 many times?
 One thing want remember money numbers
 conditioned forecast. members' forecasts nominal
 GDP bit higher ones built this,
 easily could add fraction percent might want
 anticipate M2 growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Don, know table page 8 based upon
 new Feinman/Porter model, there's one thing would ask
 opinion about:
 find rather hard believe 1/4
 1/8 point variations funds rate likely produce
 differences levels real output prices?
 
 -33-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 MR. KOHN. No, don't find incredible. think
 happened putting simulations together partly driven
 model. We've speeded changes long-term interest rates.
 think noted two changes short-term rates. So, given
 change short-term rates bigger effect it's almost
 forward-looking. could argue perhaps that's terrible
 idea although model hasn't done badly backwardSo, baseline declines
 looking yield curve far.
 long-term rates Mike noted actually extends out.

 So, would
 add bigger changes funds rate, real-MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. Don, estimates
 money projections would look like adjusted growth
 stock bond funds?
 MR. KOHN. haven't projected growth stock bond
 funds.
 think memo circulated yesterday last
 year, rough guess would would taper little
 time.
 Part what's going here--look baseline picking
 time period--is yield curve flattening
 yield curve effects, bond stock funds
 symptom, ebbing time. So, would say we'd probably add
 couple percentage points '93, maybe less '94, see
 ebbing time yield curve flattens portfolio

 MR. KOHN. Well, we've trying work issue

 It's clear

 MR. ANGELL. Don, page 8, assuming fed funds

 say, 2 percent funds rate?

 MR. KOHN. Well, couple things going here.
 One lags, it's hard line things year-byyear. velocity driven lot longterm rates spread. Porter/Feinman M2 pretty darn
 insensitive short-term interest rates. So, effect,
 weaker economy--I'd hear rest story, say,
 Corrigan scenario--and short-term interest rates lower, I'd
 expect somewhat M2, somewhat less nominal GDP. Maybe you'd
 two offsetting effects M2; it's hard sort out.

 MR. KOHN.

 Right.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Now, put another scenario out:
 Suppose

 anticipations weakness might cause intermediate rates move

 backwards, December '89 fed funds rate cut,
 instead moving it?
 MR. KOHN. could get perverse effect M2,
 President McTeer alluding yesterday.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 think
 
 Yes.
 
 MR. KOHN. general, I'd expect decline shortterm rates would mean we'd smaller increases M2 velocity.
 Now, that's happened 1992; short-term rates hadn't
 declining, velocity would even larger.
 So,
 perverse effect--if short-term rates declining longterm rates going up--then yield curve effect would outweigh
 short-term effect could get smaller M2.
 It's clear
 what's held constant here, number-MR. ANGELL.
 course, think keep mind
 since May '89 perverse effect almost 1/4
 time we've easing; times we've able way
 haven't perverse effect. Would relevant
 Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony sense regarding
 argue Fed made mistake little
 late? One might look back lack perversity--that
 intermediate yield little late resulted better
 M2 growth would gotten we'd aggressive.
 MR. KOHN. think general point, one
 Chairman Greenspan made challenged issue,
 sense working period market expectations,
 discussed yesterday, inflation turning around,
 especially think [time around the] middle oil
 crisis. Federal Reserve fairly cautious take
 account market expectations making policy moves.
 [It

 MR. KOHN. Well, Mike may want comment this,
 think take account, yesterday Chart Show,

 perhaps NAIRU right might restructuring itself; raising
 growth rate potential might also raise NAIRU since

 wholeheartedly agree statement. also agree it's
 political perception question we're dealing I'd
 like ask question regard. Since it's political
 perception question, go 2 6 percent range--which means
 we've made move--and actual growth comes 2 percent,
 putting difficult political situation?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. would say depends wholly

 now, issue fade insignificance.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. economy poorly, we're

 MR. ANGELL. Well, political perception reasons, would
 prefer go 1 5 percent M2, [lower] M3 0 4 percent,
 leave debt range alone. reason mind
 going take political heat 1/2 point [reduction]. we're
 going take 90 percent political heat go 2 6

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think we've already gotten
 political heat 1/2 point; that's everyone expects. think
 we're taking need to; frankly don't see purpose

 uncertainty here. Let's suppose move range [down 1/2

 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, support suggest.

 think you're right that, given relative variances coming
 things control things can't control, isn't
 policy consequence within ranges change we're talking
 here. would think environment

 something modest limit modesty nothing--I'd
 probably nothing all.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 Yes, nothing would look like
 
 MR. SYRON. Exactly reason think it.

 unconstrained--I'll put way--from political perspective,

 we'd say, given would like see happen economy,
 number could anywhere -1 +10. That's
 exaggeration, [wouldn't] go [to testify] range,
 even though slightly wider range earlier
 points. Widening range says something; it's consistent
 notion uncertain thing think about.
 we're going widen it, think you're right we're committed
 lowering bottom band; would look like caving
 not. would leave top 6-1/2 percent.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, think point well taken;
 largely political decision. Politically, think
 agree 5-1/2 percent nominal GDP good, won't cause us
 trouble. understand case lowering average range
 1/2 point. would suggest slightly different twist.
 going go straight face use M2 ranges
 political signal, signal would send first
 thing want prevent relapse recession.
 second, would want signal willingness prevent resurgence
 inflation. adds want cut
 top end to, say, 5-1/2 percent leave bottom end 2-1/2
 percent. really believe we're saying 3-1/2 percent
 velocity, 5-1/2 plus 3-1/2 9 percent nominal GDP growth.
 can't imagine anyone seriously thinking would support policy
 9 percent nominal GDP. hand, 2-1/2 plus 3-1/2 gives us 6
 percent GDP, 1/2 point higher think
 last year. So, would say believe forecast,
 want maintain bottom end range cut top
 end range.
 There's second possibility it's wholly
 political issue. would recommend NBER Conference Papers,
 though able attend conference. Academic economists-it's almost shock compared we're thinking--not want us
 focus M2 nominal GDP actually quarterly
 adjustment processes; [they suggest] look
 happened last quarter determine money next
 quarter. far we're talking

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 would think that, anything, conditions led large
 velocity shock last year less place year.
 President Jordan said yesterday, we've big increases
 narrower monetary aggregates. addition, there's bank
 aggressiveness, less, going on. Restructuring occurred more,
 less, year ago. we've already seen substantial
 amount CD runoff. So, would say want avoid
 
 -43-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 Jerry Corrigan afraid of, outcome outside range
 expectations, we'd want range 2-1/2 5-1/2 percent.
 That's throw another option table.
 MR. MULLINS.
 
 narrower band?
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 narrower band.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, would support recommendation
 made it.
 seems would desirable make 3
 points testimony. first one emphasized,
 technical adjustment designed accommodate decline
 money demand and, therefore, wouldn't expected produce lower
 growth 1993.
 thing might worth noting
 adjustment really consistent prior inflation goals
 doesn't represent attempt part increase pace
 disinflation. And, finally, talking
 uncertainties associated whole exercise, think may
 well confront directly possibility M2 M3
 could undershoot even adjusted target; I'd make point clear.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. similar thoughts, would favor
 alternative II, though could certainly live
 suggested. think reduction M2 range important.

 don't think one emphasize much credibility point
 made [the need avoid] perception whatsoever we're
 caving political pressures.
 It's question
 Fed's credibility institution. think it's important
 U.S. economic policy right general guard
 credibility. suggestions similar Bob's respect
 things could said. technical issue. think
 way deal Bob's point inflation may simply say
 something along lines of:
 "Just recognize progress
 made bringing inflation down."
 sense technical
 argument, too, ought recognized ranges
 technical point without implications respect rattling
 saber. future, think Bob's point controllability
 good one, said controllability; it's something
 I've agreed long time.
 think value M2

 guess
 raises another possibility terms things might say, la
 Steve Axilrod's suggestion, might bad idea point

 monetary indicators, behavior economy, etc.
 It's

 It's merely rigidity Humphrey-Hawkins statutory

 Right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 would feel comfortable dropping
 stage, don't choice. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 considerable sympathy position you've taken
 considerations go it.
 I'll add two observations. One,
 seems one consideration lower range,
 particularly lower end, course got 2 percent
 growth M2 last year. people want attribute
 us would rather strange commentary say
 sense unwilling kind growth year.
 So, think consideration suggests range ought go
 down. listening discussion, seems
 you're suggesting, certainly agree, M2
 aggregates information variables. whole host
 variables look constantly. sort range,
 aside fact it's required, good idea need
 evaluate incoming information something.
 follow approach rigorously, would establish range would
 either centered around midpoint Don's forecast and/or would
 centered around growth consider consistent
 noninflationary environment long run. think
 would imply lower ranges we're talking today, don't
 think time move aggressively. So, I'm comfortable
 you're suggesting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. would support plain vanilla 1/2
 percentage point cut ends.
 I'm attracted cutting
 lower end 2 percent leaving upper end 6-1/2 percent,
 first think appears bit cute. Politically,
 think would hear drawing target bit capture
 last shot. don't think people worried
 rapid M2 growth slamming brakes right now; they're
 worried slower growth. So, I'm plain vanilla, 1/2 point
 cut ends.
 growing bit concerned whole targeting
 process, even though I'm comfortable policy. think we're
 headed trouble even economy performs well, we're
 
 -45-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 going show negative [growth rate M2 M3] first
 quarter 1993.
 real GDP 3 percent, we're still going
 hear criticism--not political criticism academic
 criticism--that holding back pace recovery,
 restraining it. we've heard even though we've two
 quarters 3-1/2 percent GDP growth. I've become little
 disenchanted trying explain velocity changes
 think that's selling especially well. We're simply targeting
 M2 current time sense low M2 growth lead
 policy change. jointly targeting M2 velocity,
 suggests we're implicitly targeting nominal GDP.
 feel
 much comfortable nominal GDP target M2
 target, sense we're revealing nominal GDP target.
 So, causes lot confusion. goes on, think we're
 going explore structurally satisfying ways
 explain phenomenon. like notion capturing
 distortion aggregates and, example, pointing
 M2 adjusted yield curve growing, M2 plus bond funds
 growing, M2 bank deposits growing; it's S&Ls
 not.
 Obviously, don't think stage

 consider monitoring ranges anything like that.
 aggregates problems. something going remain
 unsatisfying process show very, low M2 growth
 say it's sort okay, we'll make velocity. Again,
 time we're path don't think much
 except continue think
 we're going forced back issue.
 interim, think
 you're exactly right:
 least disruptive thing take
 plain vanilla 1/2 point cut, believe fully discounted.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. one thing could come
 grips question publish couple Ms

 MR. MULLINS. could monitoring ranges.
 don't
 know we'd want paper world Ms try confuse

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN(?).
 
 think Arthur Burns 7 Ms.
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 [Having Ms] get directly,
 understandable manner, happening involves moving
 yield curve. could actually show broader
 aggregates would growing, might encouraging. So, think
 continue work supplement velocity
 argument. I, too, surprised, even academic setting,
 unsuccessful arguments velocity even though
 think people can't see behind velocity.
 they're logical.
 might easier look alternative measure.
 pointed settings, distressing shortage
 scapegoats political arena.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR.

 around here,

 President Hoenig.
 
 HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, understand you're coming

 cause us lot grief pushing us follow

 emphasizes Governor Mullins' point we've got find way
 explain means we're heavy,
 heavy, criticism going forward despite fact dropped
 range 1/2 point. it's 1/2 point think we're
 going make right away really bothers me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 think Governor Mullins raised
 important issue here. might bad idea us
 thinking prior next meeting see
 confront this. principle, long-run sense really
 targeting nominal GDP. trouble GDP it's
 fuzzy number; gets revised; it's always late. don't know
 are; it's forward-looking. we've always used
 financial aggregates advance signals informational
 indicators fact GDP going. indicators collapse,
 one goes back original source looks directly.
 may well able find number different proxies might

 know think point.
 It's drop

 People would
 terrible time [evaluating M2] argument it's

 range--almost doesn't matter.
 would looking number [that
 simply could interpreted.]
 would tough make
 judgment really going on.
 MR. HOENIG. You're suggesting dropped small time
 deposits we'd fairly fast growing M2, would add
 confusion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 That's right.
 
 already M1!
 
 [Laughter]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. suggest Kohn, however,
 give thought this, perhaps ought spend
 little time next meeting March go little
 question. think we'll learn lot, depending
 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony ultimately emerges, we'll know lot
 first-quarter GDP. moment guess
 statistical risks first-quarter GDP forecast
 side, side. Remember, we're [now] looking
 fourth quarter. looks fourth-quarter growth going
 third though, sure, third quarter
 revised down. first quarter may surprise us,
 lot configuration perceived [and]
 behave. President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, would personally prefer full
 point drop M2 range 1-1/2 5-1/2 percent. think
 makes strong case one make forecast.

 obviously plenty uncertainty forecasting money demand
 velocity, approach 2 6 percent would certainly
 acceptable me. think one thing can't nothing.
 would absolutely wrong signal. bond market would punish us
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 severely tried something like that.
 connection, agree
 Governor Mullins' [comments] yesterday would
 concern widening range.
 think people would perceive
 trying ways. could damage
 credibility.
 adopt 2 6 percent, Mr. Chairman, strikes
 might want consider saying something testimony
 effect Committee take particularly close look
 current range review July meeting.
 might even go far say current circumstances
 there's possibility would consider lowering ranges
 time. Historically, I'm mistaken, typically made
 move current range July meeting. know we're
 vulnerable McCracken kind story, strikes
 current situation, technical problems face,
 would unreasonable thing do.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. lot sympathy number things
 said far descriptions way
 Committee functions, [including] Larry Lindsey's remarks, Tom
 Melzer's, Dave Mullins', comments it.
 don't
 really care debt M3 targets set because,
 tools available, can't imagine action Federal Reserve
 influenced whatever do. central bank
 set discount rate, reserve requirements, open market
 operations peg funds rate, letting endogenous.
 look actually done, even M2 seem
 relevance Committee [Board of] Governors
 does. would seem [reasonable] circumstances, [given]
 sense efficient markets trying improve quality
 information decisionmakers, say we're going put
 M2 range it's target all.
 It's staff forecast
 FOMC intention anything try stay within
 range. imagine set circumstances, without putting
 probability it, yield curve could flatten dramatically,
 could get 1 percent M1 growth 8 percent M2 growth, long
 getting something close central tendency [of
 forecasts] Board staff projection nominal real GDP
 Committee wouldn't anything.
 
 It's inconsistent view say
 
 "Here's target M2" seek institutional arrangements
 help us hit it.
 It's target don't try something
 hit it.
 So, explain target
 don't really targets. set monitoring ranges M1
 base, might useful purposes [in terms of]
 think may fall, they're targets Committee.
 target either nominal GDP various real indicators.
 better worse, that's way Committee conducting
 affairs, think ought explained.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, went opening
 comments completely agreed said said
 but, honestly, thought coming different conclusion.
 thought made good case leaving ranges
 making change. perfect world, frankly, that's
 I'd prefer. understand aren't perfect
 

 
 2/2-3/93
 
 -48-
 
 world political perceptions
 need deal with. seem enough changes since
 correspondence received indicating might reduce
 ranges--and certainly incoming data year suggest
 numbers moving even away expectations--that one
 could make case developments taken place make
 change seem appropriate. uncertainties very,
 significant and, therefore, would leave ranges are.
 I'd prefer keep tentatively set last July,
 certainly don't feel strongly enough dissent. Therefore,
 would support case made seem feel
 comfortable political context you've said, I'd
 support that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Clearly, lot politics floating
 around; lot discussion seem center politics.
 Unfortunately, politics lot perception, point
 perception reality start merge. worry
 developing platform criticism. think clearly
 something think whatever action taken shouldn't need lots
 explanation. action speak itself, one
 reasons like idea lowering bottom end
 necessarily top end think [a wider range] would convey
 increased uncertainty. said that, though, [one could] say
 top end probably irrelevant part whole
 range point. wouldn't wait March next
 meeting, though, start discussing text looking
 types Ms.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 I'm sorry, text thinking
 
 of?
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 
 text Humphrey-Hawkins.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 report itself, mean?
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. report itself. might shower
 kinds Ms, think indication
 monitoring M2--that say, looking M2
 plus bond funds, plus stock funds, adjusted yield curve,
 on--would [appropriate].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. mean means trying explain
 velocity question without getting velocity--?
 MS. PHILLIPS.
 
 Right.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's interesting idea.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. One could think even sort
 surcharge period things unusual it's
 appropriate deviate looking M2 traditional
 [measures] start looking more--
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 -49-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. you're suggesting unbundling
 Feinman/Porter analysis way readily describable
 econometric.
 MS. PHILLIPS. Right, understandable! So, guess
 preference would President Syron's approach. probably would end
 supporting 1/2 point [reduction] explanation
 monitoring ranges [besides] M2.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 buy recommendation this.
 Given
 are, think it's least harmful way deal it.
 would stress technical side.
 I'd like comment broader

 think velocity approach loser. don't
 think gotten us anywhere. view strength
 institution real world strength:
 understand markets,
 feel these, understand institutions.
 would explain English rather econometrics.
 think long-term short-term rates

 way it. would hope
 testimony maybe even elaborate appendix.
 would
 somewhat wary, however, dropping M2 anytime soon even thought
 seriously flawed. better approach continue M2
 get people used M2-A M2-B several
 look time. Then, time goes people get
 used these, M2-A M2-B become M2; think get
 people used change.
 make definitional changes
 dramatically without kinds parallel alternatives, think
 run real problems. make case better
 made make real world sense. use
 something else eyes look road
 make definitional change shift [to new M2 measure].

 believe handled, think ought get it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, first I'd like say
 appreciate long-term outlook provided
 Bluebook; think useful exercise.
 agree entirely
 statement setting ranges doesn't serve
 particular policy purpose. we're faced statute.
 operating nonpolitical context, logic would suggest
 set ranges encompass think M2 going do.
 That's honest thing do. Unfortunately, don't operate
 nonpolitical context judgment political considerations
 paramount here. anything would play
 hands political opponents sense would sense
 victory might adverse consequences market. So,
 think compromise, describe way, 2 6 percent
 think would confusing everyone
 right way go.
 try fine-tune either lower end upper end
 ranges. would straightforwardly 1/2 percentage point
 reduction. think Governor Mullins exactly right:
 issue
 going go away. I'm persuaded technical issue,
 velocity issue, salable argument.
 
 -50-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 Many points made good ones terms
 testimony. would inclined stress performance
 economy improvements inflation GDP, notwithstanding
 lower range M2.
 don't think time us
 waste lot political capital issue. We're going
 continue get heat, think setting range 2 6
 percent best way [proceed].
 Let say one final thing.
 You've taken already lot heat; you're going take more,
 I'm sure. would hope Committee would
 completely supportive you're going
 tough time, suspect; think behind way.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Thank you.
 
 Governor LaWare.
 
 support recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation
 reasons gave. would like join everybody else
 helping write testimony!
 [Laughter]
 I'd include
 said morning:
 weren't required law, probably
 wouldn't this.
 would say honestly directly.
 would call attention unusual behavior M2 M2 velocity
 past year refer technical
 adjustment explain happening common sense
 language.
 I'd describe bypassing banking system
 disintermediation point it's disintermediation caused
 low interest rates rather high interest rates, unlike people
 learned earlier disintermediation caused by. I'd point
 measures money--the base, M1, forth--have growing
 rapid rates; I'd point make logical
 adjustments, adding stock bond funds, M2 would
 middle target range. draft
 adjusts M2 stock bond funds minus IRA Keough accounts,
 don't think
 shows us right middle target range.
 many people understand that. Milton Friedman Paul Samuelson
 don't seem understand it, think there's economic education
 problem deal with! don't publish
 lot Ms least need talk lot Ms. Maybe
 include appendix, someone mentioned, follow rule
 suggested earlier shouldn't even show chart M2
 without Ms page can't
 separated. might even refer earlier period '80s
 opposite problem, money supply growing
 target ranges nobody seemed complaining that.
 So,
 think there's almost requirement better job
 economic education.
 realize we're going convince
 critics, lot people watch C-Span it's depressing
 days.
 support 2 6 percent range M2.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, 2 6 percent formulation
 slam-dunk me. say find
 discussion around table troubling several points. First
 all, someone nothing distaste disdain
 M2--even people thought good--I'm quite ready
 
 -51-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 accept point policy purpose served
 context discussion, even though confidence M2.
 also find troubling amount emphasis put
 point basically political thing we're talking
 here. don't agree that.
 think first instance
 choices Committee substantive choices.

 choices current circumstances [viewed]
 context there's lot noise numbers well
 elsewhere. view substantive. kind
 bimodal risk analysis think becomes substantive, whether one
 likes M2 not, depending upon economy evolves,
 could make tremendously important difference terms
 perceptions policy policy itself. So, said, I'm
 altogether enamored body English gone
 discussion.
 also terribly concerned throwing Ms
 there. Now, pointed out, Mr. Chairman, that's Arthur
 Burns did. Chairman Burns may succeeded confusing
 Congress may confused because, looking
 results policy era, I'm sure something
 would want associated with. think grave danger
 get Ms there--[up to] M27 something-everybody's going happy one Ms it's going
 everybody we're going end
 convoluted policy. So, I've got help write testimony too,
 unlike almost everybody else I'd keep really simple.
 think
 pretty good story tell terms whole policy

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, also happily
 support suggestion so. We're dealing large
 uncertainties, vitally important unknowables, don't use [M2]
 anyway running policy. logical case made
 various [ranges] little higher little lower--one
 made logically another--they much absolutely
 different anyway. So, indeed become political question.
 one responsible conducting policy, it's easy stay
 tried true, least seems tried
 true. That's done sophisticated basis academia
 much cruder simplistic basis politically perhaps
 largely media. responsible, cannot rely
 
 -52-
 
 2/2-3/93
 
 seemed tried true even though might silence
 critics short run. know could get us bad
 trouble long run; can't that. I'm delighted hear
 comments around table morning, certainly would like
 add voice, need explain facts much
 accessible ways maybe use available hitherto ignored
 channels get story we're trying do, we're
 it, we're doing. need language that's
 accessible media general public political
 critics political friends. So, think suggestions
 Bob McTeer others made right. Perhaps we're forced
 it; we'd prefer there; historically, may
 that's today. return
 started, certainly think suggestion politically
 viable way project targets would be.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. propose vote
 following ranges: M2, 2 6 percent; M3, 1/2 4-1/2 percent;
 debt, 4-1/2 8-1/2 percent. Read the-MR. BERNARD. I'm reading page 22 Bluebook or,
 you're using form, starting line 36: "The Federal Open

 would [ideal] actions could expressed

 might quickly make three points.
 First, think immediate release operational paragraph
 directive deserves study. It's possible
 study would show benefits equal might outweigh
 costs. strongest argument this, memo
 makes clear, fear adverse public market reaction might
 make Committee reluctant take actions take.
 hand, one could argue might helpful lot
 situations Committee able vehicle
 [preparing] public market major changes short-term
 policy, especially changes basic direction short-term
 policy, able move asymmetric directive

 think deserves consideration. strong
 advantages.
 that, would releasing decision
 information would deal leak problem pretty
 categorically. think lot recommend it.
 second point would make hope find
 way revive old Memorandum Discussion, remember
 early days System, long delay release
 think there's good bit learned monetary policy
 monetary policy process scholarly investigation

 MR. BROADDUS. That's point. guess

 may impossible recognize
 that. I'm saying would hope think
 carefully make sure there's way protect definitively.
 final point would make, goes option "E"
 subcommittee appears favor, certainly agree
 it's worthy study. would simply underline
 subcommittee recognizes:

 real reservations announcing federal funds rate [target]
