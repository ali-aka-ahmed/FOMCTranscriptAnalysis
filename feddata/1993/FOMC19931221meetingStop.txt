 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor, since you're standing,
 move minutes last meeting?
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Yes, move.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. think you're

 like move delegation responsibility?

 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. know we've done considerable
 work United States weed statistical effects,
 I'm sure exist countries, normal noise
 variables creates inverse correlation price change
 real GDP look implicit price deflator one hand
 gross domestic product constant dollars other.
 

 
 words, independently estimated nominal GDP
 independently estimated set prices consider
 noise variables, you're going end picking
 negative correlation. United States think we've done
 enough area demonstrate even adjusting
 [using] industrial production versus price, subject
 problem, still creates robust relationship. causation
 question big debate is.
 curious:

 I've forgotten came
 run Granger-causation tests U.S. data?
 that.
 MR. STOCKTON. work carried Board
 we've done types statistical causality tests
 appear indication inflation causes
 productivity growth. lion's share negative correlation
 inflation productivity growth occurs contemporaneously.
 evidence, one would say, possible
 there's causal relationship certainly doesn't show
 strongly data. correlation appears
 contemporaneous, raising questions [relationship].
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, doesn't necessarily follow
 causation must one direction other.
 both.
 
 12/21/93
 
 concurrent relationship could consistent unit labor
 costs pulled hence price level.
 recall
 whether strictly statistical sense Granger-causation
 results significant?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 think answer yes,
 significant running inflation productivity. magnitude
 relationship looked relatively weak terms lagged
 part. You're absolutely right terms contemporaneous
 relationship; could fact reflect causation running
 inflation productivity growth.
 skeptic could look
 evidence say:
 doesn't prove, course, isn't
 going opposite direction well. appears
 tantalizing correlation cross-country studies
 time series data. difficulty presenting
 skeptical audience, think whatever regression result put
 table couldn't feel confident somebody else wouldn't come
 along another demonstrate particular regression

 therefore, couldn't explain it.
 words, assume
 we're looking something argument productivity
 increases cause low inflation refuted level.
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 It's refuted level, that's
 
 correct.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 questions?
 
 MR. PARRY. question seems
 terms price distortion effects inflation,
 pretty strong results.
 effect productivity, etc.,
 doesn't show strongly.
 correct?
 MR. STOCKTON.
 
 That's correct.
 
 MR. PARRY. aren't strong theoretical
 analytical reasons think would negative effect?
 fact quantitative results always strong
 focuses much data, affected many
 things.
 would say establish something theoretically
 analytically--and think that's done--it's very,
 [probable].
 would say respects results
 much stronger you've portrayed.
 MR. STOCKTON. It's certainly case review
 literature examines effects inflation pricing
 system relative prices, overwhelming majority studies
 come conclusion fact inflation introduce
 distortions price [signaling].
 think strong evidence

 MR. PARRY. analytically conclusion [inflation
 leads to] lot problems terms productivity probably also

 12/21/93
 
 -3-
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.
 think fairly widespread
 acceptance inflation rates 10 percent clearly
 disruptive; probably large majority [believe that] 5
 percent upward.
 crucial question happens academic
 evaluation inflation 5 percent [or less]; [views] start
 spread place.
 MR. PARRY. think work indicated moderate
 rates inflation price distortions statistically
 significant.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. ask:
 anybody ever
 tried isolate impacts trying subtract GDP
 costs fighting inflation?
 MR. STOCKTON. No, hasn't done;
 issue raised conference flaw, sense,
 studies we've done date relating inflation growth output.
 would something research-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. basically raise GDP
 finding something reservoir water, tell
 GDP District Columbia went water pollution
 question came retail activity everything
 else went on. one questions measured GDP actually
 means, especially particular context.
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, think one could also note
 interpretation made System conference
 wanted way emphasis sort set aside
 questions damage might done terms welfare lost
 unanticipated inflation people saving enough
 retirement.
 There's whole array welfare costs might
 go high unpredicted inflation. there's whole area
 explore one wanted look reasons one concerned
 non-zero inflation.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Bob right
 set analytical model, cause effect, demonstrate
 crucial points micro evidence,

 uncertainty relationship uncertainty cost
 capital growth, build argument, even data
 macro level insufficient largely data
 considerable amount noise them. indeed forceful
 tight inverse relationship exists, quite possible
 there's enough statistical noise data system bring

 MR. PRELL. Well, recognize it's hard
 establish, macro issue, anything definitive
 research. analytical points argue
 low inflation could conceivably better inflation. tried
 experiment, also thought mission try put
 empirical flesh analytical [bones].
 progress made
 concede lack certainty--
 
 12/21/93
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, thought memorandum
 really quite useful.
 think results obtained showed
 fairly extensive advance state knowledge area.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 gentleman?
 
 Thank you.
 
 Questions either
 
 MR. JORDAN. couple questions Mike.
 look back Greenbook projections '93 starting year
 ago, balance encouraging. Even though intra-year
 pattern growth currently reported different, know
 that's going revised away anyway, let's pay much
 attention that. cumulative effect year
 real growth year, even get 5 percent fourth quarter,
 going projected year ago. inflation
 probably going come slightly less, measured consumer
 price index, looks pretty good. look
 current projection 1994 versus year ago, output growth
 projected slightly less thought year ago next
 year inflation quite bit more--1/2 3/4 percentage point
 consumer prices.
 I've read written I've listened
 said it's still clear think
 inflation 1994 1995 going higher level
 thought year ago.
 MR. PRELL. Well, price performance year relative
 expectation year ago depends series look at.

 GDP fixed weight price measure expected 3/10ths
 point higher expected '93 year ago.
 crosscurrents price data. modest--though
 think significant terms whether consistent
 expectations deceleration--slowing core inflation past
 year. somewhat lower level unemployment
 higher level, think, capacity utilization expected
 point. see compensation data, consider
 another important measure underlying costs trends, really
 clear evidence ongoing deceleration even course
 period unemployment higher now.
 perhaps sanguine might prospects
 ongoing substantial deceleration move 1994.
 We're re-calibrating things move along here.
 looking different initial conditions expected see
 enter [1994].
 Now, one could certainly argue variety
 econometric models built Phillips curve--one you're
 particularly fond of--that could significant
 deceleration. view, using model,
 NAIRU 5-1/2 percent, significant output gap;
 normal rules thumb would produce deceleration prices
 have. hand, think many people would
 say prospects aren't quite rosy we're forecasting
 be. basic notion think likely
 direction trend inflation 1994 downward.
 MR. JORDAN. Let follow everything I've
 seen, including Ted's report, outside United States
 virtually everything been, anything, much, much weaker '93
 expected year ago. global marketplace
 model, framework, slack, excess
 
 -6-
 
 12/21/93
 
 capacity thought year ago would time.
 global economy would say less price pressure
 year ago would thought time.
 MR. PRELL. Well, going significant
 competitive pressure imports number sectors
 economy, [though] sectors. sectors susceptible
 influence degree.
 noted, import
 price prospect one things makes us hopeful
 continue downward [inflation] trend. import price
 pressure last year. isn't element
 forecast going move [significantly] favorable
 direction 1994; anything, prospects might infer less
 favorable contribution import price side.
 we're
 splitting hairs.
 think picture essentially
 doesn't really make big difference go forward terms
 rate deceleration.
 MR. JORDAN. Okay, one point, may
 technical question. Historically gap GNP deflator
 CPI 1/2 percentage point, noticed
 [widen] percentage point '94 carry
 '95 almost full percentage point. What's giving rise that?
 MR. PRELL. think major story ongoing
 increase relative importance computers, whose prices
 decreasing rapid rate.
 MR. JORDAN.
 
 Translate one wrong.
 
 MR. PRELL. Well, different measures.
 think
 deflator optimal measure prices even broader measures
 consumer prices going affected computer pricing.
 SPEAKER(?).
 
 technical matter computers much
 
 smaller weight CPI deflator gross domestic
 
 product. weight one item, fall price, small
 CPI it's relatively large deflator.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mike, 1992 GDP revisions
 discrepancy thought saw initially hours worked
 output removed and, course, GDP increased
 substantially. first half 1993
 phenomena numbers [that could change in] revision
 well.
 one sort pro forma revision, making similar
 occurred 1992, implications amount
 slack would point?
 would [view that]?
 Toward end presentation mentioned concerns
 cautionary measures [unintelligible]-MR. PRELL. Well, don't strong conviction
 likely magnitude direction revisions GDP, personal saving
 rate, key variables would look
 first half
 gap potential actual real output.
 year, sure, evidence income side
 somewhat rapid growth registered GDP numbers.
 
 12/21/93
 
 isn't night day difference. don't think would make
 great deal point. least leery
 defining precisely GDP gap looking
 unemployment gap.
 It's difficult number construct.
 don't
 think looking anticipated revisions would loom large
 thinking inflation risks.

 possible revisions industrial production measures capacity

 we're agnostic

 MR. LINDSEY. Could ask question fiscal model

 I'm reading across top line.

 etc. carries through. I'm puzzled timing,

 $49 billion increase Q2 '94 Q2 '93.
 I'm even slightly puzzled Q2 '95 Q2 '94
 percentage increase quarters.
 Could
 briefly explain way timing scored government receipts?
 MR. PRELL.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 You're talking actual unified-Unified budget receipts.
 Yes, receipts.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Now, come OMB, okay.
 didn't think did.
 

 
 MR. PRELL. No, case don't. I'm sure
 give good answer cuff here. put
 forecast effects '93.
 modest differences
 OMB CBO estimates. We've little conservative
 sense allowing bit greater behavioral response,
 diminishing income tax receipts accrue. April
 we're expecting see substantially higher level non-withheld
 income tax payments 1993 second quarter.
 that's key feature year-to-year movements revenues apart

 economic activity boosting corporate personal
 income. 1995 I'd look closely. see
 lesser gain second quarter second quarter '95
 '94, seems reasonable me. can't specific

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, technical question.
 don't somebody it.

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Sure.

 MR. LINDSEY. would great, thanks.
 kind bump assume unlikely affect consumption patterns
 pretty much anticipated.
 MR. PRELL. Well, isn't precisely we're viewing it.
 things progressed, we've moved bit direction
 thinking could larger effect first half 1994
 We've made shift
 initially allowed for.
 direction. Yes, it's true lot people knew tax
 increases coming; began adjust behavior least
 timing income receipts late 1992, showed
 bonuses coming then.
 looking behavior
 consumption year, one hard pressed discern anticipatory
 effect. it's entirely clear everyone behaves totally
 rationally terms gauging lifetime income stream
 adjusting expenditures quickly. probably number
 households going somewhat liquidity constrained
 tax time. we're anticipating
 disproportionate effect first half 1994 people really
 calculate confront tax bills.
 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Thank you.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. questions? not,
 would like start Committee discussion?
 President Broaddus.
 MR. BROADDUS. moved table year ago
 time since I've general agreement
 Greenbook projections.
 I've often thought risk error
 bit side, staff projections usually
 struck generally reasonable sort within
 confidence interval. can't really say strongly
 time, least get beyond current quarter. number
 things make think Greenbook forecast time may
 significantly underestimating growth economy economic
 activity get 1994.
 First, think there's good chance projected sharp
 deceleration consumer spending won't happen, especially durable
 goods.
 may get deceleration don't think it's going
 sharp Greenbook projecting. Among things
 Greenbook expects fiscal restraint exert fairly considerable drag
 consumer outlays next year. maybe will, seems
 upper income people likely affected
 tax increases could reasonably seen things coming long
 year ago, certainly middle last year. seems
 quite likely taxes already worked effect
 already whatever impact they're going path
 spending going forward. broadly, nothing recent data
 suggests economy generally pull back
 fiscal drag fiscal restraint. seems
 current acceleration activity, quite strong, basically
 driven interest-sensitive sectors economy:
 housing, consumer spending durable goods, producer spending
 durable equipment. suggests decline real
 interest rates going time perhaps
 
 12/21/93
 
 finally showing rather fundamental way economy
 generally. unless there's sharp backup interest rates,
 especially long-term rates, would expect sectors continue
 bolster economic activity period ahead. Also I'm less
 pessimistic Greenbook prospects net exports,
 although get Ted's comments maybe read Greenbook

 particular framework pessimistic actually is.
 significant reductions interest rates number
 industrial countries seems could give us
 somewhat stronger recovery G-6 countries Greenbook
 appears expect.
 standpoint compelling reason would
 questioning staff forecast time anecdotal
 comments we're hearing District, none suggests
 real diminution activity going forward. contrary, sense
 we're getting virtually directors
 business contacts economy gaining momentum pretty much
 across board. give couple examples:

 Baltimore directors, pretty good cross section people,
 pessimistic last meeting. last meeting
 positive outlook first time really since
 recession '90-'91. thing [is true] Richmond
 Charlotte; they've somewhat optimistic several months,
 last meeting much positive
 current situation outlook time.
 we're getting much stronger comments business contacts.
 lot manufacturing activity District we're
 contact people. Many telling us first
 time long time plan bring new workers within
 next six months. haven't heard significant broad
 degree recently. Also declining vacancy rates commercial
 property number areas District increased optimism
 among commercial builders real estate developers. year ago
 guys saying would never get better. add
 acceleration general economic activity begun raise
 concerns inflation among least contacts,
 though it's terribly widespread yet.
 think mentioned
 something, Mike, pricing power. Several business
 contacts told us believe recently
 could make price increases stick, they're beginning think
 within next six months.
 So, overall, can't remember time years I've
 here--maybe one exception, early 1983--when I've seen
 broad accumulation positive information economy
 nationally District. think important
 implications policy decision today. think--I hope--we've
 known along economy really began gain
 strength, going let real short-term interest rates
 move zero. money believe we're now. And,
 frankly, defer action funds rate longer, think
 could jeopardize credibility commitment price stability
 good things credibility economy
 long-term interest rates.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 12/21/93
 
 -10-
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, District also underlying
 level economic activity clearly gained momentum since
 last meeting. Virtually important sectors area
 shown improvement, driven largely certainly
 exclusively auto sector. auto production schedules,
 course, strong quarter; first quarter
 next year set 13 percent first quarter
 year. first quarter year pretty good
 comparative period. industry estimates
 contribution first-quarter GDP little stronger
 number that's Greenbook. Given this, it's surprising
 steel industry continues operate high levels.
 Shipments year come 88 million tons.

 forecast next year ship 90 million tons,
 3 4 percent increase. One company talked said
 outlook steel industry next two three years
 best seen fifteen years.
 parts economy also well. farm
 equipment business strong. heavy truck business
 expecting even higher level sales next year year.
 improved level experienced year, turns
 out, due environmental standards
 become effective January 1st. Machine tool orders, example,
 though third quarter, year October
 almost 30 percent. retail sales--and think
 fairly strong recent development--really increased quite
 substantially past month so.
 It's uneven; it's much
 stronger durable goods side apparel.
 Nonetheless, overall
 retail conditions described best prevailed
 three four years. think I'd give high odds
 Christmas season going come little better
 employment situation also
 forecasts we're hearing about.
 strengthened. Consistent Al said, first
 time remember heavy manufacturer indicated
 far
 add employees one facilities.
 able meet increased demand increasing line speed.
 plan add another shift, require additional
 employees.
 completely capacity major constraint
 shortage qualified drivers; aren't enough people
 available drive trucks.
 cautious--really rather bearish time
 --describes employment conditions best seen quite
 while.
 regard national economy, clearly fourth
 quarter come strong side.
 think question,
 Mike outlined, whether experience kind
 drop first quarter next year year
 whether [the quarter] line staff forecast.
 must say point think enough underlying
 momentum place economy decline quite likely
 much line staff forecast.
 Certainly,
 uncertainties there, well familiar.
 point least, [the forecast] free doubt.
 regard pricing experiencing interesting dichotomy:
 strong growth economic activity yet pricing conditions
 
 12/21/93
 
 continue very, competitive.
 Despite higher demand
 products, manufacturers don't latitude raise
 prices confidence [the increases] stick.
 continuing put tremendous pressure suppliers maintain
 even reduce prices, many achieving
 considerable success. Whether fundamental change last
 whether we're setting stage somewhat higher prices
 broader basis remains seen. hunch
 basis discussion get policy deliberations.
 MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, could clarify something
 earlier response President Jordan? GDP fixed
 weight price index expected, CPI core CPI
 risen past year anticipated last
 December unemployment rate 1/4 percentage
 point lower got decline unemployment output
 growth anticipated. I'd assert strongly
 broad consistency fundamental principle applied
 forecast continues apply. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. report
 Twelfth District economy optimistic, although changes
 California small mixed. October employment District
 states outside California showed considerable strength,
 employment increasing 40,000.
 Annualized economic employment growth
 rates month ranged 2-1/2 4 percent
 states; Idaho Nevada, incredibly strong,
 actually recorded double-digit rates expansion. One thing
 bit surprise last month two what's happening
 state Washington. Washington's employment growth outpaced
 District states, expanding 8 percent October
 following 6 percent growth September. eastern
 Washington continues reflect think correctly
 characterized boom conditions associated intermountain states, contacts also report business activity
 western Washington stronger. However, cutbacks aerospace,
 course, remain drag region's performance. California's
 economy remains weak although current conditions mixed
 November payroll employment

 little changed recession low reached October. Moreover,
 job losses continued areas construction
 manufacturing. positive note, reports contacts
 California longer uniformly negative. Retail sales
 improving some, certainly good conditions
 sectors motion pictures, entertainment, also agriculture.
 Within state, economic conditions clearly weakest southern
 California, especially Los Angeles area. Layoffs continue
 aerospace defense, construction remains quite depressed. Real
 estate values appear continuing slide area.
 Conditions relatively stronger huge agricultural area
 Central Valley also northern California, despite falling
 employment Bay area.
 Turning national economy, point think
 likely outlook growth roughly
 incorporated Greenbook. seems us following
 
 12/21/93
 
 -12-
 
 going clearly strong fourth quarter see
 reduction growth rates along line indicated
 Greenbook.
 would say based upon [the Board staff's] forecast
 wouldn't surprising see labor market slack
 reduced core rate inflation incorporated
 Greenbook. However, time think reasonable
 chance growth inflation turn stronger
 projected, along line Al talking about. New orders
 production picked areas besides autos, think GDP
 1993 may revised extent, providing momentum
 growth next year. result, it's possible gap
 potential actual GDP may diminishing faster rate
 anticipated forecasts. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, District continuing
 grow; actually it's showing indications faster growth
 last half year think going 1994.
 Construction
 activity still strong continue so.
 note
 Intel building $1-1/2 billion plant New Mexico, adding
 1,000 jobs, activities throughout
 District.
 Services seem good improving, although perhaps
 quite strongly information we're getting
 national level. Manufacturing District either stabilizing
 actually improving, smaller job losses durables

 declines--McDonnell Douglas American Airlines maintenance

 job gains manufacturing. farm economy stable despite

 Stronger grain prices offsetting weaker cattle
 prices may see earnings pressure '94.
 energy
 sector actually holding despite fact oil part
 dead region. Gas activity, though, positive;
 obvious relationships two, gas
 prices still holding drilling activity going
 there.
 Within context I'd like provide anecdotal
 data; data systematic
 are, think, worth noting. area prices, example, land
 prices sensitive region.
 Wyoming we've sales
 and, one recent sale, fairly large ranch sold perhaps 10
 15 percent expected; local neighboring
 ranchers, outside investors coming in.
 north central Kansas,
 general trends still price increases around

 percent trend line would suggest. areas like Denver
 Albuquerque we're hearing comments boom-like

 We're seeing speculation residential real estate;
 loan growth fairly strong, especially areas Denver,
 parts Omaha, Lincoln. we're seeing activity there.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, economic activity
 District continuing move along moderate pace
 think we're outperforming nation. Retail sales
 fall somewhat disappointing holiday activity quite
 good mid-December, certainly lot better
 retailers expected. news relatively important
 tourism sector continues mixed; busy season Florida
 approaches there's still substantial concern impacts
 unfavorable publicity related crime activity months ago.
 time Mississippi money pouring state
 result gambling activity along coast
 Indian reservations, it's giving rise employment.
 I'm
 certain way produce economic activity, that's
 another issue. Business convention bookings quite healthy
 Atlanta.
 manufacturing sector pace activity steady
 November posting quite impressive gains October.
 outlook area becoming steadily positive terms
 orders, production, employment.
 think that's particularly
 evident outlook capital goods, brightened
 orders picked recently producers become positive
 current period expansion extended. Now,
 negative side, continued cutbacks defense aerospace
 well decline important apparel sector muting
 enthusiasm little. Single-family homes continue sell quite well
 around District. Even though inventories reduced,
 don't reports [housing] price increases great
 extent, although people trying pass along
 recent increases lumber prices. generally speaking, singlefamily home prices moved much all.

 nonresidential commercial areas signs slow
 steady improvement begun take hold think
 areas there's pretty general feeling bottom
 energy sector
 reached outlook positive.
 rig count Louisiana fallen last two months although
 it's well level year ago.
 concern
 among producers natural gas lower oil prices cause
 substitution effects. spot gas prices marginally,
 marginally, $2 level that's needed make new drilling
 feasible.
 balance continue see gains employment
 District service area, although I've indicated

 see little
 evidence price pressures.
 anecdotal information supports
 idea price increases difficult obtain even
 positive atmosphere. anecdotal information also confirms
 positive things I've talked about.
 generally
 feeling things much better. business contacts I've
 had, including directors, indicate feel momentum
 place economy. Now, go meetings I'm often
 asked policy I'm also given requests.
 frequent
 request get is:
 "Please leave things way are; don't
 anything."
 respect national economy, changed
 forecast since last meeting. We're general agreement,
 said last time, Greenbook near-term outlook.
 get latter part 1994 1995 think growth
 going somewhat stronger, inflation rate higher,
 unemployment rate somewhat lower. Basically difference
 consumer area think employment increases wages
 salaries going help sustain consumption [growth] probably
 order 3 percent period. Now, said
 forecast somewhat higher growth higher inflation,
 continued vulnerabilities risks forecast.
 would cite particularly international outlook, although

 2-1/2 percent. 1995 even apart
 deflator going 3.3 percent.
 Now, differences enough
 believe assumption fed funds rate remaining

 one certainty
 case. question is:
 one's forecast say policy move evident,
 taken? yet sufficiently certain forecast think
 lead policy move. possibility slowdown
 first quarter sufficiently great would well
 advised view wait additional data come in.
 We're particularly [waiting for] two [statistics]:
 One first
 look fourth-quarter GDP, comes late January;
 employment data month January, scheduled
 come first Friday February, second day
 next meeting. Even though forecast today--if
 absolute certainty--would lead one say time take policy
 action imminent, view would prefer wait
 additional data reaching conclusion.

 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First let say

 think us feel appropriate policy largely
 hands strongly one feels growth. main question,
 course, pace [the expansion is] liable sustain
 next year. looking strong fourth quarter
 sustainable, strong rate ease back somewhat
 there? long list factors I'm sure everybody else
 does, Mike expressed eloquently earlier won't go back
 that.
 somewhat harder evidence

 nevertheless there. Defense cuts occur.
 hope it's true

 Foreign economies may well start look better

 thinking recently, that's going happen overnight.
 [their sluggishness] may well continue stretch seemed
 likely months now.
 sustained strength case strong; Al started
 meeting strong credible statement that.
 makes [policy decision] terribly close call; guess,
 Ed Boehne said, don't know. think first quarter
 liable start strong, echo nothing else.
 sustainable? remember time last year--obviously don't
 exactly situation last year huge fourth
 quarter last year--that took subsequent three quarters get
 meaningful momentum going again. even third quarter,
 past, impressive. going get that?

 might well, even though probably severely. So, close
 call seems factors calling pull back
 apparently fourth quarter strongest case.
 Greenbook forecast something close correct,
 possibility likelihood running inflationary
 problems quarters yet; it's hard tell far.

 depend exactly goes fast gap GDP gets
 closed.
 [the economy] somewhat stronger Greenbook,
 that's toughest call me, don't know say
 that.
 believe it's considerably stronger
 [the strength] sustainable, move immediately.
 I'm quite there.
 I'm cautious January, particularly,

 people mentioned ought speed meeting I'm
 
 12/21/93
 
 going [compress] views since generally agree number
 arguments made. First all, let say
 it's rather obvious point acceleration seeing
 heavily motor vehicles, though fully means.
 also see steel markets number commodity
 markets. It's remarkable big factor motor vehicles industry
 still economy. sales levels moved
 significantly scrappage levels one would
 calculate engineering point view normal structure
 scrappage. mean sales levels go
 higher, can't grow [over time] pace they've
 growing. since we're talking rate growth GDP,
 even automobile sales flattened higher levels,
 definition gross auto product inventory change goes zero
 change. think seeing combination motor vehicles
 residential construction, latter tending also
 lead factor auto sales themselves.
 don't know whether
 subscribe Mike Kelley's view it's hard believe go
 higher; go higher, running resistance.
 looking autos construction,
 would say expansion going flatten fast.
 trouble process occurs engenders incomes;
 even though leaders slow sudden find,
 look business cycle history, begin fade
 secondary industries begin come in.
 would probably noncomputer-related capital goods types activities cash
 flow engendered corporate sector business
 sector generally think fairly impressive. looking
 likelihood, rate gain industrial production,
 probably getting inventory effect here.
 can't large
 presumption get [monthly] industrial production
 increases .7 .9 going consumption,
 square history. Nonetheless, still yet
 see indications lead times material deliveries
 moving. sure, operating rates moved up;
 extraordinary rise import penetration across board
 country made domestic operating rates less indicative
 nature pressures system. There's extent
 become extraordinarily well internationalized.
 One argue saving rates low that,
 therefore, consumption expenditures slow abruptly.
 trouble saving rates, know,
 notoriously poor estimates. often find fact
 weren't thought. event, evident
 willingness part consumers start taking debt
 indication stage unduly pressed
 unwilling spend they're running income. think
 5 percent [GDP growth rate], whatever get fourth
 quarter, technically unsustainable.
 fact, Greenbook
 indicates, disaggregate it, gross auto product [accounts for]
 2 percentage points .4 coming
 [unintelligible] statistical adjustment. issue whether not,
 Governor Mullins said, expansion sustainable, looks
 increasingly sustainable. doesn't look yet though
 getting surge credit demands system usually
 [tinder] inflationary acceleration. think, pointed
 
 12/21/93
 
 out, credit numbers finally beginning move. don't
 see loan data we're beginning see net debt
 nonfinancial sector starting rise. It's still moving
 slow pace relative history finally beginning move.
 leads conclude, number
 concluded, days accommodation got [about] over.
 think correctly moved rate balance
 sheet structural restraints exposed to; turned
 exceptionally successful policy. balance sheet
 adjustments indeed occurred--not yet fully; still
 clearly way go, rate change slowed
 dramatically. marginal increases
 balance sheet adjustments come, longer absorbing--as
 used put it--the excessive head winds impact saw
 earlier time. Therefore, recovery seems finally moving
 manner which, requiring significant tightening
 central bank, surely indicate degree accommodation
 must soon eased. Now, don't know [should occur]
 find difficult believe go long 1994
 That's unlike way
 without starting process.
 usually think things--that one thing time--it's
 pretty obvious recovery taking broad general
 characteristics historically say it's got legs it,
 process single upward adjustment
 whole succession way restoring [unintelligible]
 positioning [our policy stance] closer neutrality. agree,
 Wayne Angell said, [means funds rate] closer 4 percent

 symmetric directive, clear understanding unless
 outlook suddenly deteriorates far rapid pace seems
 even remotely likely would consider moving path fairly
 early year. would merely put general
 discussion. President Jordan.
 MR. JORDAN. remark suggested something
 communicating actions hadn't considered before,
 next action communicated easing degree
 accommodation, would easing move think. I'm increasingly
 troubled rhetoric outside--by people looking
 do--and sometimes even within Committee notion growth
 per se reduces purchasing power money. puts us
 way perceived, maybe perceive ourselves, says
 we're anti-inflation, we're anti-growth. lot trouble

 12/21/93
 
 slack model, Phillips curve kind tradeoff calls
 forecast things like capacity sorts things
 trouble with. even people operate
 framework would suggest careful saying want
 maintain degree unemployment idle capacity sub-potential
 growth something because-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let say fully agree
 would say issue credit.
 MR. JORDAN. would like see us setting
 objective four five years.
 fact, hope
 Bluebook February meeting gives us longer-term indication
 price level path. belief objective
 moving price stability measured somehow in, say, four five years
 conduct actions way achieve objective,
 level output standards living people would go
 operate way maintain past rate
 inflation. don't know whether staff projections would show
 not, that's conviction. talk times speeches
 articles though reason moving price level stability,
 stabilizing purchasing power money, order enhance
 standards living growth. conduct affairs
 short-term way though trying restrain growth
 we're worried [our economy] growing rapidly. it's partly
 conceptual theoretical issue it's partly communications
 issue.
 far short-term actions, agree suggestion
 symmetric now. would like see asymmetric directive
 critical nature move. also agree
 comments Governor Mullins made waiting certain
 data trigger [an action].
 take issue
 suggestion Bill McDonough made [January] release
 [fourth-quarter] GDP February release nonfarm payroll
 [employment data January].
 numbers going come
 strong, last thing would want perceived
 reacting strong numbers knock down. think
 numbers going strong, better move ahead
 numbers.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE.
 think days degree accommodation
 numbered. It's likely sooner rather later we'll
 reduce level accommodation. think, however,
 we're period wait-and-see. move, believe
 Committee vote explicitly make decision
 it's important. reason think ought
 symmetrical directive face issue squarely
 "This
 time comes everybody record saying:
 we're going do."
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, think quite likely
 current quarter see moderate growth next year
 and, therefore, could support alternative B.
 It's little hard
 
 -34-
 
 12/21/93
 
 reach conclusion risks symmetrical, leads
 direction thinking case asymmetry
 toward restraint. could easily buy symmetry also would
 get Ed Boehne offered.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, certainly respect
 position but, said earlier, think accumulation positive
 economic news we're seeing really quite extraordinary.
 situation think time come let real short-term
 interest rates rise order make expansion sustainable one
 keep getting hand side. really
 think need move now. recognize certainly
 arguments moving yet, fact always

 clearly promptly we're going distracted

 So, would favor 1/4 point

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, thought forecast
 correct fulfilled, would certainly want move
 think probability

 forecast turn right one. enough
 uncertainties surrounding forecast want wait
 little longer make sure recovery expansion
 fact sustainable. would prefer wait agree
 also think it's important,
 prescription score.
 others indicated, crucial time--at turning
 point, crossroads--that take action meeting.
 would also prefer symmetric directive.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. comments I've heard far suggest
 incompatibility. agree want take action meeting;
 think that's important.
 also think Jerry Jordan said
 true. don't want reacting high real growth number.
 That's simply bad policy it's also bad PR. nothing
 growth. February meeting coincides
 release real GNP number know going high--I
 believe that's correct--yes?
 
 12/21/93
 
 -35-
 
 MR. MULLINS.
 
 don't know.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Well, betting number going
 high. think it's [released] Friday. Isn't
 correct?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 No, it's employment report is--
 
 MR. LINDSEY. first
 [for fourth quarter]?
 MR. PRELL.
 
 [release of]
 
 GNP number
 
 20th January.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. last statistic [that meeting]
 would strong real growth number, think we'd perceived
 reacting high real growth number. we'd probably
 strong employment report following that.
 Therefore, don't see us
 acting February meeting; would see us postponing March
 moved. brings back logic best time
 move right now, 1/4 point increase, show
 simply responding strong real growth.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, support proposal. We're
 always going acting situation uncertainty; that's
 way is.
 certain, wouldn't need here.
 think time come, we're going make mistake, err
 side tightening rather staying non-neutral position.
 think direction we're prepared go in.
 Ordinarily might think asymmetry situation,
 enhance credibility maintain credibility it's much better
 group act whole time [the move made].

 would hope could done degree consistent spirit
 across group time it's done. would strongly
 favor staying symmetric now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.
 
 MR. MCTEER. came meeting, Mr. Chairman, thinking
 time coming soon ease accelerator bit
 probably wasn't yet.
 influenced much
 statements Messrs. Broaddus, Angell, Lindsey, Mullins.

 think Mr. Mullins gave good argument something now,
 although don't think conclusion. It's close call
 whether wait go ahead something now. However, I'm
 glad, three reasons, try split difference
 change [to adopt] asymmetric directive. One
 tend frequent use asymmetric directives
 principle, primarily it's main thing inhibiting
 moving prompter release decisions.
 think need
 move use asymmetric directive complicates
 general. Number two, don't want us appear responding
 strong growth statistics; think statistics going
 strong next weeks [if move] it's going appear
 we're anti-growth. think public ought understand
 inflation thing
 growth. third reason one someone mentioned
 
 -36-
 
 12/21/93
 
 likely beginning series moves
 important enough us meeting
 [participate decision].
 would rather tighten slightly
 change asymmetric directive, I'm prepared
 follow suggestion.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER.
 favor increasing degree pressure
 reserve positions now. think economy's momentum intensified
 point capacity maintain moderate inflation,
 mention declining inflation, appears run out. mentioned
 before, growth narrow money reserve aggregates
 quite stimulative nearly seven quarters current
 cyclical expansion. Last year alone monetary base allowed

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Hoenig.
 
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, said earlier, think
 information evidence mounting economy

 inclined see rates moved modestly be, sense,
 anticipating that. I'm certainly willing see goes
 first year. reason also feel strongly
 agreed-upon action Committee.
 would
 agree proposal.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 MR. MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, agree "B" symmetric
 let say why. think combination great many outside
 remarks accompanied remarks number us--first person
 plural--have made led world believe antigrowth, that's bad position in. It's bad monetary
 policy, it's bad economics, it's bad within public sector
 live.
 think need educational exercise

 probably [can said in] Humphrey-Hawkins testimony
 or, it's difficult Humphrey-Hawkins testimony clear

 regards data come early 1994,
 mention existence data--the first measurement
 fourth-quarter GDP January employment data--was [to point
 out] that, forecasts wrong high side

 I'm
 absolutely convinced bring monetary policy
 neutral stance early part next year.
 timing
 related education effort find necessary
 release specific data.
 would fact opposed
 way would seem lead observer conclusion

 far whether directive
 symmetric asymmetric, believe--maybe strongly
 anything I've stated--that symmetric. Since
 highly, highly likely don't firm policy today,
 next meeting, asymmetric directive
 anything--on top two asymmetric directives
 correctly didn't change policy summer 1993--could
 easily put us posture substituting asymmetric directives
 action, even though think policy firmed,
 sooner rather later. valiant central banker could appear
 somebody waves little flag soon shots come
 across, pulls back again. think could
 unattractive public relations impact asymmetric directive,
 would quite counterproductive real purpose is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Keehn.
 
 MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, also would favor
 alternative B symmetric language. seem
 environment one policy stance ought heading
 asymmetry toward tightening. think it's question
 timing. key first-quarter data begin come
 rather fourth-quarter data. don't think we're
 going much available tell us
 first quarter really coming in. that, I'd
 prefer stay are.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 MR. LAWARE. I'm little puzzled fact almost

 think agree that. many made
 fine statements saying "Don't react strong employment

 Chairman's statement really very,

 I'm going add one tough deal,
 right? is:
 Don't make 25 basis point move.

 far away neutral believe are,
 it's much better wait week two get 50 25

 that. strongly believe act--or act--that
 50 basis points. Remember 1970s jiggling
 along moves 1/8th percentage point; didn't work.
 It's hard start moving rates up; '87, Don, believe
 [initially] raised funds rate 25 basis points. move
 meeting move asymmetric directive March?
 MR. KOHN.
 
 I'm sure, Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. think put rate 25 basis
 points bond market [went up] another 50 basis points
 course wasn't enough. wasn't Alan Greenspan came
 really said "Hey, wait minute," caught
 bad timing situation. Now, think ought
 50 basis points really think ought 50 basis points now.
 reason ought now--or whenever next
 opportunity is--is unexpected bad things happen. go along
 get employment number, get get that,
 doesn't seem [to the] right [time] it.
 remember Paul Volcker called
 caught May 1987.
 Manley [Johnson] said, effect:
 "Look, guys

 Every day looked markets,
 including foreign exchange value dollar strong,

 comfortable proposal knowing

 short, possibility take look

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. HOENIG.
 
 Yes, check will--
 
 case would support it.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, suppose there's question
 people would willing come, there?
 would
 assume will.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 don't think there's problem.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, said well earlier.

 disagreeable distasteful go this--and
 perhaps overstating it--but think it's almost necessity
 take kind step. Look, we're going resolve
 issue this. Mr. Gonzalez staff going keep
 us matter do. we're accused
 secretive, that's around country now--we've seen
 editorials on--I think we've got dispel extent
 can. importantly, we--I wasn't call,
 others--have accused lying engaged conspiracy,
 challenged. seems real way
 use best evidence, call itself.
 letters write anybody else writes going
 convince anybody unless get material prove
 irrefutably, understand it, occur. think
 you've made meaningful distinction kind meeting

 draw line there. would say, think you've said
 before, continue withhold monetary policy deliberations

 That's business want change

 wouldn't move beyond furnish
 monetary policy transcripts unless we're forced whole
 Congress.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Parry.
 
 MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, support recommendation.
 two questions.
 deny access, likely
 mind Chairman Gonzalez would try get Committee
 
 12/21/93

 issue subpoena? secondly, likely he'd
 successful since isn't monetary policy issue probably
 viewed lot people House something sort
 got together develop tactics testifying?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Remember accusation
 [that engaged in] form conspiratorial action.
 members Banking Committee might disagree Chairman
 nonetheless feel obligated [to investigate] circumstance
 there's accusation nature refuse release
 evidence.
 would say would quite easy majority
 marshalled subpoena because, indeed, it's
 accusation insignificant dimensions.
 It's minor
 transgression he's accusing us of.
 President Melzer.
 MR. MELZER. First all, think need go ahead

 MR. MATTINGLY. Yes, can. you're giving right

 Virgil.
 Chairman made distinction, made distinction,
 others also discussions monetary policy
 discussions matters. legal precedent we're

 doesn't give access tapes, whether

 That's view, yes.
