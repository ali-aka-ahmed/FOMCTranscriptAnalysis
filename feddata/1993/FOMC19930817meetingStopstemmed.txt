 ms. phillip.
 ms. green.
 ms. phillip.
 
 thei're demand yen?
 demand fewer dollar.
 it's sort rel thing.
 
 ms. green. ye. built up, cours,
 seen japanes compani respond differ, mention.
 previous believ dollar would recov
 therefor would abl sell dollar higher rate,
 will hold dollar exposur. belief
 fade, peopl sai:
 "i cut loss;

 that's observ japanes export constantli reduc

 coupl week import addit factor.
 mr. forrest. gretchen, think french realli

 question either gentleman?
 
 mr. syron. mike, look auto pattern
 see us, wonder feel leas

 come along like earlier incent saw price.
 specif, i'm think leas term seem
 wai similar direct price sale promot devic saw
 earlier. much realli shade residu veri,
 close? even go neg residu
 incent kind thing? term view

 mr. prell. well, think discuss

 margin. on step diminish flow car go
 rental compani come back nearli new perceiv
 fairli close substitut new car. partli respons
 gener rise retail demand, meant didn't
 sell car concessionari term [nor did] rental car
 compani.
 demand remain uptrend think we're see,
 japanes car price like even pressur
 might anticip light appreci
 yen, mai tighten market,
 firm price either less aggress residu
 valuat leas devic.
 don't think
 good insight trick thei're go us.
 mr. syron. feel sort
 time happen befor. think [kind
 incent] go offer discret number week
 case, never mind month, remov
 point.
 mr. prell. well, seem maintain incent.
 thei've broaden recent. don't think deep
 quit broad we've seen end model year
 clearanc period stock pretti [low].
 so, might
 enter new year less overhang prior year model. "end
 year" gotten bit vaguer. see new model come
 differ time year; case chrysler, on
 reason thei're push hard thei're go
 bring new model end year, sort '94-1/2
 [model].
 so, there's lot go here. sens
 moder level promot activ go

 for-on term tax increas spend cut look fairli
 legitim there. also got impress perhap
 quit backload term expenditur cut origin
 case. defin issu term spend
 cut make less pure number?

 1994 term tax increas versu expenditur cut. and,
 cours, boskin articl wall street journal

 dramat chang.
 mr. prell. well, honest can't give neat
 account thi. didn't perceiv outcom
 drastic differ we've assum previous.

 it.
 it's hard see major risk would caus signific
 break-out side. likewis, it's hard see break-out
 side would caus cumul downturn. nonetheless,
 pattern, bob forrest point out, start
 year optimist scale growth
 forecast.
 think busi attitud
 good quarter, take don't think it's go continu

 nice sharp declin long-term interest rate. neg
 attitud budget packag foster, said minut

 direct. latest inflat data encourag--no doubt
 it--but think it's possibl overst progress. alwai
 plai bit number game respect [the base for]
 calcul. i've calcul right, core cpi rate
 annual basi first seven eight month year
 3.3 percent compar 3.4 percent last year. so, progress

 quarter mai actual worsen. so, think we've
 made gain credibl, still distanc go
 realli convinc market public gener
 go go wai time price stabil. also,
 would make point:
 think precis move
 fund rate long period time, direct
 shift back symmetri
 languag big signal.
 stage game, it's go get lot attent
 involv risk. so, standpoint i'd rather stai
 asymmetr direct.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 governor lindsei.
 
 mr. lindsei. mr. chairman, back 1965 georg aiken,
 senat vermont, recommend declar victori get
 appli
 vietnam. alwai thought wise judgment.
 todai. first all, think reason get
 asymmetr direct reload go
 fight anoth dai. goe without sai. think
 part aiken recommend--that declar victori--is also
 import.
 somewhat concern governor mullin
 indic:
 take move signal budget
 vote. actual we're veri, well
 plan--it's almost miracul well work--shift
 nuanc polici, thought convei well market
 believ. led businessmen, instead talk
 inflat, come back sai:
 "we tri rais price
 couldn't."
 think realli chang expect there.
 let world know we've done right that's
 we're it. wai, declar victori part make
 so, i'll go

 unlik chang fed fund rate.
 so, come
 purpos [symmetri the] direct.
 present time think market quit well prepar believ
 chang direct tactic tool polici

 percept. perhap appropri time on speech
 testimoni might includ remark. sinc think it's highli
 unlik would fact chang fed fund rate
 next meet, believ avoid shift signal devic
 direct polici statement. sinc don't think
 that, stai asymmetr would put us posit
 empti postur, alwai extrem injuri
