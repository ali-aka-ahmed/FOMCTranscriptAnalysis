 March 23, 1993
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone. usual
 procedure, know, approve minutes first. prior
 I'd like call Governor Mullins.
 MR. MULLINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. topic
 subcommittee proposal creating new document called "Minutes
 FOMC."
 genesis proposal comes recent
 Senate Banking Committee hearing two senators, Senator Mack
 Senator Riegle, stated Federal Reserve didn't even
 produce minutes FOMC. think us episode made
 abundantly clear public, including important public policy
 officials, little appreciation quantity detail
 material already release. So, subcommittee proposal
 would assemble convenient easily accessible form,
 appropriately titled minutes, information currently
 released FOMC meeting. know, issue policy record
 press release. Minutes Actions,
 information currently produced, simply placed FOIA office
 accompanied press release; elicit
 little public demand.
 So, specific proposal release merged document
 consisting Minutes Actions Policy Record along
 Executive Summary title "Minutes FOMC."
 hope
 would approach would underscore quantity detailed
 nature information make available. subcommittee feels
 materials constitute appropriately described
 minutes context use term organizations,
 public private. So, would change timing
 release nature contents document
 proposal. suggestion initiate proposal release
 week minutes February FOMC meeting. mentioned
 document, February meeting minutes somewhat longer due
 organizational votes, thought would appropriate
 start new annual cycle. So, would open discussion
 subcommittee's recommendation form described
 memo March 17.
 MR. FORRESTAL. David Mr. Chairman, comment
 questions. comment perhaps minor nature, seems
 someone Hill might well question use
 term "Minutes FOMC" we're really
 combining two documents. may may problem,
 throw consideration discussion. question
 whether talked timing release group
 whether plan accompany press release
 explanation change is.
 MR. MULLINS. guess reason used word "minutes"
 think minutes include Minutes
 Actions Policy Record. terms changes timing, based
 upon discussion Committee last time propose
 change timing. [new procedure] may focus people's
 attention timing. Norm, proposing
 respect explanation what's going on?

 MR. BERNARD.
 would straightforward. really
 would explanation. someone inquired, presumably Mr. Coyne
 would provide explanation there's new material,
 combination things. minutes, including attendance
 items approval operations forth,
 would published, understand it, Bulletin.
 policy record part minutes, least, would published
 keeping current practice Board's Annual Report.

 press release have--it follows Governor Mullins' memo
 package--is simply patterned current press release.
 Instead
 referring policy record, refers minutes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. might say happened
 arcane terminology Federal Reserve used
 us.
 normal notion minutes corporations,
 well know, three paragraphs. gets fourth
 paragraph everyone objects it's getting specific.

 that's usually whole day's meeting! impression

 minutes. used term "minutes" usual employment
 term corporate America. corporate America terms
 "minutes" far closer Governor Mullins committee
 suggest put out. We're merely taking action alter
 language, creating regrettable difficulty us see
 it.
 MR. FORRESTAL. agree that. wanted make
 sure focus fact critics might, use
 word "might," allege we've tried get away something
 combining two documents calling minutes.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 So, Robert's Rules Order clearly suggest

 MR. MULLINS.

 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Dave, think it's good idea
 this.
 question executive summary. think

 MR. MULLINS.
 
 Tom.
 
 MR. MELZER. going make comment. draft
 you're seeing first draft we've seen
 subcommittee too. concept sounded like made sense.
 looked compared policy record,
 seemed almost impossible without adding meaning. Now,
 think it's good summary somebody who's going bother
 read policy record. think people read these,
 press Fed watchers, read meaning it.

 example--I don't want beat death--where talks

 conclude evaluate monetary developments

 saying people read going add meaning
 may intended say this, say,
 don't say. So, problems trying, effect,
 restate policy record.
 MR. MULLINS.
 
 Mike.
 
 MR. KELLEY. defense summary notion, we're
 sound-bite situation here. People don't long attention spans.

 That's important think it's positive.
 MS. PHILLIPS. I'd like support Governor Kelley this.

 So, support Mike's contingent this.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think you're raising separate issue,

 desirable consider latter, next meeting

 wouldn't necessarily vote it, initial reaction
 little cautious. fact, haven't given terribly much
 thought don't want say one way may come
 end. I'm sure mechanically effectively
 implement executive summary even though don't desire
 time; means postpone whole thing
 next meeting. anyone comments that?
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. think worst case
 executive summary we'd meeting
 meetings agree language summary.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. reminds anything

 out. we're going executive summary, statement

 views exactly phrased, suspect may

 recommend go ahead vote new version "Minutes

 ask whether objection that. Hearing none, would

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 explanation is, however one looks
 
 this, decline inflation expectations.
 

 
 could argue weak economy, say, year ago without
 expectation significant change long-term inflation. That's
 strikes credible explanation, whether

 That's makes sense.
 MR. PARRY. think 1-year forward rates quirk

 MR. D. LINDSEY. I'm going argue presentation,
 though, feedback effect lower interest rates,

 shift back aggregate demand constant real rates
 ensuing real rate declines helped mitigate fears, giving
 investors sense economy could continue growing

 clearly decline inflation expectations played role
 well.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Joan, sensitive market? said
 market skittish; vulnerable reversal
 recent rally? words, get another strong employment
 report, let's say, maybe another month unfavorable inflation
 data, think market going react strongly
 enough deficit reduction program prevent that?
 MS. LOVETT. Oddly enough, juncture think
 information market expects real side favorable
 inflation prices. People generally tended feel
 reports January February sobering, really
 indicative trend prices. believe
 slack, particularly labor side, going keep inflation
 reasonably well contained, even it's downward trend,
 employment report perhaps overstated things. think
 recovery continue, sense it's
 
 vulnerable [the process of] going Congressional
 passage budget.
 [There concerns] compromises
 going made get package
 compromises going mean death knell intent
 package, will, we're going end perhaps half
 loaf.
 MR. MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman, could add something
 that. think one things would give market fair
 amount insulation really nasty kickback
 investment banking firms--the Street--have practical purposes
 missed rally completely. outsmarting
 consistently saying:
 "Well can't true; inflationary
 expectations cannot adjusted downward." And, therefore,
 every time they've temptation short market they've fallen
 right trap. net result they're still long.
 still pretty much either flat fooling around short
 position. And, therefore, securities held safer
 hands, less likely throw see bad

 good shape get unpleasant news absorb well,

 MR. JORDAN. I'm left little uncomfortable part
 explanation expectations short rates relate

 Earlier year, beginning last year,

 MR. PRELL. Well, may element truth that.
 fact, one story we've heard change

 monetary ease/monetary restraint path. seems
 monetary policy ordinarily needs slight restraint mode
 ought avoid severe restraint mode. is,
 made mistake go severe restraint mode.
 Now, let's look indicators monetary ease. doesn't
 surprise would use rising commodity prices. Let give
 numbers. ex-food, ex-energy experimental index

 first quarter. put numbers machine morning

 lumber prices quarter 1000 percent annual rate,
 let's take lumber prices see left. take
 lumber prices it's "only" 33 percent annual inflation rate

 take things out, too.
 
 MR. ANGELL. It's always easy take something one

 total index
 26 percent annual rate first quarter, given
 favorable energy price environment energy weighted something
 like 55 percent total. food prices, look
 food prices see favorable unit labor cost
 factors us think know that's really quite
 positive. also know food commodity prices
 start moving upward rapidly are. food commodities
 experimental index first quarter 50
 percent annual rate. Now, gold prices longer falling.
 fact, gold prices 1.7 percent lower one year
 ago. Gold prices downward trend long period
 time world adapts different monetary policy environment.
 gold particular kind technological evolution
 taking United States among also-rans gold production

 That, course, unlike equilibrium price gold would
 occurred earlier period. is, saw price
 gold get $280 ounce last decade,
 environment new low-cost technique producing gold. So,
 we're environment U.S. gold production [incurs]
 variable costs somewhere $220 $250 ounce.
 naturally environment gold prices tend move downward
 relative commodities. gold prices stopped
 downward move. Now, don't know 12 percent annual rate
 increase gold prices last six weeks meaningful.
 Frankly, gold prices moving down, [I would
 discussed sooner.] That's kept quiet subject
 longer otherwise would been.

 seems
 second indicator monetary ease:
 we're somewhat tepid foreign exchange value dollar
 face relative strength U.S. economy versus economies
 abroad. economy much stronger economies
 much weaker interest rates abroad coming interest rates
 United States fixed, I'm asking myself:
 isn't
 dollar stronger? seems indicator may
 dollars realize. third thing would suggest-Governor Lindsey already mentioned prior meeting--is
 short-term real interest rates approximately zero,
 seems indicator monetary ease. fourth thing
 unprecedented steepness yield curve, indicates
 short-term rates pegged Wicksellian natural rate
 interest. may sound eclectic today guess that's
 am. suppose another perspective would 3 percent
 pegged fed funds rate economy moving 1-1/2 percent
 different 3 percent pegged fed funds rate economy

 Even remember IS-LM analysis!
 disappointing PPI CPI numbers.
 worries
 little trying run monetary policy based upon CPI PPI
 forward-looking enough, dangers
 Governor Mullins mentioned certainly apparent. Now,
 environment think recognize favorable employment
 cost numbers continue extraordinary. Also, commodity prices
 steel scrap prices rising--and way, Mr. Chairman, steel
 scrap prices 89 percent annual rate first quarter,
 though annual rates, course, tend get exaggerated. think
 us know labor costs restrained prices
 moving forward, indeed isn't wonderful opportunity
 regard profit expectations.
 So, causes believe
 economy may stronger; continue stand forecast,
 1 percentage point stronger Greenbook's. Now,
 Greenbook [forecast] keeps creeping up, point time
 may get closer mine. haven't moved mine since
 Humphrey-Hawkins [submission].
 Now, let also look briefly three historical
 periods concern. first concern is:
 we?
 feel
 position similar William
 McChesney Martin Fed 1967.
 inflation rate still
 1-1/2 2 percent range yet think ignored needed
 look instead set stage decision
 made scrap Bretton Woods, sense turning Fed's money
 printing machine loose 1960s.
 But, clearly,
 Arthur Burns became Chairman, already launched era
 severe choices made. I'm talking
 over-restraint. severe choices, course, made
 U.S. economy suffered gravely era last
 Martin period first Burns period.
 I'd also like look favorable example
 history, Volcker Fed 1984. Now, think anyone knew [the
 Fed had] done 1981 1982, done
 1984 really unprecedented Volcker Fed point
 time--and here--in sense began tighten
 looked CPI PPI numbers. didn't wait
 bad PPI CPI numbers. think Paul Volcker always
 closet commodity price watcher! [Laughter]

 steps needed taken preemptive way.
 lock progress inflation. meant doubledigit inflation came 4 percent locked in. also
 meant introduced period rolling recession adjustment
 sector sector rather whole economy synchronized,
 prolonged economic expansion.
 last period history want look one
 participated--early 1987.
 knew January February
 voting "no" accepting status quo monetary policy.
 knew over-extended regard lowering fed
 funds rate 1986 correct it.
 somehow
 mood time went along. Now, think we're
 dangerous crossroads. pegging short-term fed funds rate,
 pegging fed funds rate dangerous exercise.
 recognize fed funds rate may stay neutral
 agree least Jerry [Jordan]
 long, pegged is.
 shouldn't peg fed funds rate, whether agree
 direction ought go. Now, seems ought enter
 period let little trial
 error, [moving] fed funds rate response outlook

 higher 3-1/2 4-1/2 percent range. say
 time say monetary policy working need
 [begin adjust] time comes something drastic
 something drastic always disruptive U.S.
 economy.
 So, think we're dangerous period. don't know
 inflation going rise 4 percent; think not. don't think
 4 percent inflation horizon. think
 progress get inflation low enough [isn't
 factor affecting] business decision jeopardy.
 think bring restraint board gives us chance
 realize continued diminution rate inflation 3
 percent really very, bad inflation rate. newspapers say
 inflation gone; mean 3 percent. Three percent terrible,
 keep course.
 don't keep course
 get 2-1/2 2 percent, I'm quite certain we'll lose

 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First I'd like
 thank David Mullins good balanced commentary
 inflationary outlook minutes ago certainly share [his
 views].
 must say looking re-emergence
 inflationary pressures, scares
 could wind looking stagflation-type context.
 get there? Well, I'm encouraged comments hear
 around country uptrend continues seems
 gathering strength. That's certainly good news share
 feeling hear around table we're less less
 danger economy swoon us.
 hand,
 don't see economy likely run away side
 say least.
 Clinton program goes through, we're going
 looking level fiscal drag beginning set '94
 [continuing] thereafter. old constraints we've
 living long time excised yet. 50 mile

 economy carried consumer '92 worry
 consumer doesn't really much reserve buying power building
 yet. Consumer debt little terms service-toincome ratio, that's mostly due lower interest rates
 lower absolute levels debt. know, latter alltime high recently guess they're still [close to] all-time
 high even though they're peaks. none leads
 believe much confidence consumer spending
 going continue carry us way far, particularly if,
 whatever reason--inflation fears whatever--interest rates begin
 rise again. could effect consumer
 everything else, could possibly part causing

 broader monetary aggregates may mean, certainly don't know

 so; speak seem weaker ever. Taken
 all-in-all, think Greenbook's path best one; hope
 get it; it's likely one. looking
 possibility re-emergence inflation here, could be,
 really fear stagflation may context within
 could occur. that, seems me, would [cause us face]
 very, special painful kinds considerations.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. Well, uncertainties exceptions,
 economy appears showing signs upswing
 portion traditional business cycle, although certainly
 strength saw fourth quarter '92.

 seeing consumer purchasing continue; it's surging, it's
 least continuing reputable pace. Employment showing
 signs strength. We're seeing pretty strong corporate cash flows.
 Long-term interest rates, we've discussed morning,
 finally come down, financial sector appears well positioned
 continue provide capital budding recovery. Prices firming
 areas certainly negative connotations, it's
 also sign strengthening economy. Now, given traditional
 signs improving economy, think forces
 likely continue restrain [it preclude] robust
 recovery; we're certainly seeing monetary aggregates.

 corporate household restructuring continuing
 balance sheet repairing also operating side.
 don't think
 we're seeing diminution operating restructuring began
 last year. still ahead defense restructuring

 could certainly upset fragile consumer confidence situation

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Lindsey.
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, think comments
 point really reflect divisions we're seeing. It's almost
 
 -33-

 dissonance. So, ask myself: What's wrong picture?
 soggy economy rising CPI numbers. Greenbook
 says one thing Blue Chip forecasts say another.
 commodity prices pointing toward boom dollar weaker
 given current economic situation.
 hand, bond market rally [weakness in] M2.

 conclude we're probably looking wrong
 things.
 I'm struck go around country--and
 tend piece together--are regional [variations]

 mean could version stagflation, likely-well, let sum way. statistic called

 That's lot closer NAIRU 7 percent sounds. suppose

 I've already told colleagues [on Board]--a man I've
 never viewed inflation hawk. sitting next lunch
 asked forecast was. thought easily
 would 4 percent inflation year. He's worried labor
 market [pressures] picking up. spoke dean

 something like this--again we're looking what's wrong

 one major factor gives great concern moving

 we're going restrain economic activity without constraining

 other, possibly redefined, aggregate might show worthy
 reasserting kind role. can't say offer one
 today you.
 MR. MCTEER. May ask follow-up question that?
 time wondered pushed harder fed funds
 rate reduce whether might accelerate
 disintermediation around banking system result smaller
 values Ms rather higher. according this,
 3 percent fed funds rate, get certain set growth
 rates monetary aggregates; lower fed funds rate 1/2
 point get faster rate growth aggregates,
 raise fed funds rate 1/2 point get slower rate
 growth them. question that, question is:
 taken
 account Feinman/Porter work, interpreted part
 cast doubt this?
 MR. D. LINDSEY. Well, let take minute answer
 question complicated. First all, answer depends
 lag look at.
 we're simply going four months
 midyear. think evidence pretty clear we've got
 sign right. Around ends two prior years System
 eased got big increases money growth February
 succeeding years.
 Indeed, large effect we're
 saying think X-11 distorted seasonal factors. So, think
 short run, given lags quickly deposit rates adjust
 downward, clearly effect narrowing
 opportunity costs inflows particularly liquid accounts.
 answer part question would say I'm confident
 signs near-term effects.
 gets tougher go
 year. You'll recall February Bluebook put
 together simulations show decline federal funds
 rate would tend increase rate M2 growth year's time.
 You, recall, asked thought reasonable
 answer was--I'm paraphrasing it--that it's questionable sense
 make intermediate-term rate adjust faster
 response funds rate [decline] standard quarterly
 model order get result like that.
 allow
 intermediate rate come speed
 simulation then, yes, M2 increase. used Feinman/Porter
 model simulation; that's result got.

 interesting, Governor Angell pointed meeting,
 nominal GDP [growth] responsive decline funds
 rate M2.
 words velocity simulation tended
 rise lowered funds rate. Nevertheless, simulation
 based Feinman/Porter model extraneous assumption
 Finally,
 long rates react movements short rates.
 I'll try keep short, view quite different
 Feinman/Porter model. view model attributes
 much interest rate spreads attributes, therefore,
 little effect reductions short rates time;
 small interest elasticity certain variables
 doesn't embody all. seems variables
 work period pushing M2 time easing
 moves tending support M2.
 view, model doesn't fully
 appreciate support giving M2 easings
 isn't quite rich enough capture omitted variables.

 3/23/93
 
 So, personal answer question is:
 Yes, even
 year's time, appreciable interest sensitivity M2.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, think it's quite appropriate
 several members raised concerns inflation
 future. all, responsibility. need be,
 terms, "vigilant."
 think need vigilant
 sides equation. First all, seems evidence
 far persuasive inflationary cycle
 even beginning one. Secondly, also seems
 expansion really quite young; don't know whether describe
 tender age adolescence, still
 question sustaining quality, although things certainly
 looking better. So, said that, seem
 premature make move time.
 think would
 serious mistake Committee take action time,
 preference yours--that is, alternative B
 symmetric directive. would add would prefer alternative
 paragraph directive one we've using

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Syron.
 
 MR. SYRON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree Bob

 think it's good thing people raised concerns

 may creep beyond that; evidence past certainly
 supportive that.
 strongly support [the view]

 quickly mention. look Bluebook--not page 8

 There's
 lot uncertainty structural issues. None us

 much weight that. beyond that, least mind,
 think affect prices determines inflation.
 don't think avoid [the conclusion] effects come
 real sector. magic this.
 think,
 Jerry others said before, way got prices
 economy quite soft; don't see we're
 position now--and course reflected labor
 markets--where there's kind impetus that's consistent
 longer-term rise inflation. said that, I'll fully admit
 story going way old price numbers keep
 going keep saying can't happen analytical
 framework have. think would premature move
 stage. also would prefer alternative language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President McTeer.

 MR. MCTEER. agree Bob Forrestal's desire
 symmetric vigilance. Maybe another way putting
 policy equivalent kinked demand curve. We're
 necessarily happy price have--that is, fed funds
 rate--but great disadvantages moving either
 direction. So, we're sort stuck while. moved
 Mullins-Angell argument. didn't expect us seriously
 considering tightening accelerating inflation,
 argument make impression me. time would
 prefer follow Governor LaWare's admonition remain red alert
 regard. So, support "B" symmetric alternative
 paragraph.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Boehne.
 
 MR. BOEHNE. think moderate, robust, growth.
 still structural drags economy financial system;
 slack labor markets subdued labor costs; we're

 inflationary pressures likely held check. add
 up, come constant monetary policy point,

 might, would far prefer consensus group,

 think maintaining current stance absolutely appropriate.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Vice Chairman.
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I, too, would support alternative B,
 symmetric. Again, face conflicting signals,
 think go back look fundamentals.
 fundamentals, best judge them, still okay even though
 risks changed. Again, context Governor Angell's
 earlier point, don't remember '68 '69, remember '84
 '87. might add '88; think '88 watershed, too. three
 cases side ledger, whatever that's
 worth, three cases conviction

 real economy [is going].
 it's reason prefer
 stay least little longer.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Stern.
 
 MR. STERN. I, too, support alternative B, symmetric
 language, alternative description monetary aggregates.
 Like many others, discussion break re-thought
 price situation went back fundamentals little,
 recognizing we're probably going good getting
 timing precisely correct. factors
 mentioned won't belabor them. seems
 [we in] environment industrialized
 economies either weak contracting, labor markets
 relatively soft, fiscal policy probably going give us
 least dose restraint; doesn't strike
 environment inflation going accelerate durable
 time. think certainly wait least May acting.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Kelley.
 
 MR. KELLEY. "B" symmetric, alternative language, Mr.
 Chairman, reasons mentioned.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Broaddus.
 
 MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, certainly accept
 proposal. Let say, though, think next several
 months going really critical period monetary policy
 suggested comments. seems what's happening
 moving somewhat tentative recovery
 period mature expansion; certainly chances
 happening. period business cycle
 past inflation pressures often quietly begun build,
 even though slack economy. Jerry others
 suggested, think markets going watching us
 closely period see whether act resist
 pressures, fact arise. specifically, they're going
 watching see react increased risks inflation
 even see undeniable evidence it. context

 Governor Angell's comments way ran monetary policy back

 don't want overdramatize, don't think it's exaggeration
 suggest credibility fought hard establish--and
 think we've done successfully--over last 10 years could well
 line next several months. again, said,
 could certainly go "B" symmetric language. agree Bob
 Forrestal others expressed need caution.
 But, frankly, get another month two crummy inflation data,
 think need think change least tilt toward
 tightening directive language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Phillips.
 
 MS. PHILLIPS. "B" symmetric. certainly seems time
 keep powder dry. guess objection
 alternative language; I'm crazy it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Mullins.
 
 MR. MULLINS. First, respect rate adjustment,
 there's question tightening restrain inflation;
 there's also question aligning rate might
 considered observed rate inflation, 4 percent
 past 6 months, 6 percent past 4 months. seems
 possibility we've eased real rate
 terms inflation rate gone up; so, that's something
 think about. general concerned get couple bad
 [inflation] numbers, market respond. market
 also start wonder whether we're still job. don't feel
 comfortable putting faith quirky index persuasive
 economic logic well indicators side.
 risk putting [our faith] fundamentals sense may
 reassemble May look back, couple bad
 numbers, almost three quarters imbedded trend core CPI
 4-1/2 percent. stage would support Chairman's
 judgment ride bit longer responding therefore
 hold off. don't know there's much advantage trying
 signal asymmetric directive; might well make judgment
 go along here. So, would support "B" symmetric
 alternative language.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Melzer.
 
 MR. MELZER. could accept proposal, Alan. think
 symmetry issue, might well take heat make
 move, words. We've movie recently
 it's probably worth it. two things influence
 thinking right now. I'd probably concerned hadn't seen
 slowdown M1, reserves, base, forth last
 couple months. know, don't think appropriate
 target policy, think value indicator
 thrust, slowed down. thing
 we're looking higher inflation numbers, although David makes
 point well we're still probably looking enough
 numbers yet sure. It's dangerous overreact high frequency
 data. agree Al Broaddus said, wait
 
 3/23/93

 we're absolutely sure we're looking inflation expectations
 become imbedded, it's hard catch up, said too.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. MELZER.
 
 we're several months late.
 
 Yes.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Governor Angell.
 
 MR. ANGELL. agree everyone issue symmetry.
 You've got right. hope I'm wrong score. hope

 hear saying rate inflation doesn't go up--and
 maybe won't--we're okay. I'm pessimistic rate
