 foreign market expect declin there--could
 factor well.
 discuss market
 import focus on mention,
 increas chanc futur reduct deficit?
 ms. lovett. well, think it's futur reduct
 deficit portend go forward rather reduct
 themselv. but, know, gener likelihood economi

 thei're start. peopl market look
 near-term weak somewhat mitig drop
 interest rate occur alreadi. so, expect

 could argu weak economi, sai, year ago without

 that's make sens.
 mr. parri. think 1-year forward rate quirk
 look 1-year forward rate 3 year last year,
 come down. time [1-year forward] rate 10-
 30-year [horizon] basic flat. would accord
