 chairman greenspan. i'd like rais question
 mike ted. discuss briefli last night interest
 path long-term rate rel simplist model. there's
 interest question that's implicit thi; name, if,
 fact, primit model, on could postul could
 drive fund rate zero, hold long

 therefor look forward signific declin long-term

 mr. prell. well, think hypothes situat

 chairman greenspan. question either
 presid jordan.
 gentleman?
 mr. jordan. fund rate unchang littl
 year now. so, seem us look back
 period see els unchang chang
 direct try make sens it.
 review
 success greenbook period sinc year ago, on
 thing struck littl forecast nomin gdp
 second half 1994 chang. year ago time
 [extend forecast] anoth year, curiou
 1995 project look like get those, that's
 main question now. fund rate stai 3 percent [your
 forecast for] nomin gdp growth still order 4-1/2
 percent littl second half 1994; hasn't
 chang much even though lot thing chang
 
 9/23/93
 
 then, see estim
 meantim success greenbook.
 potenti real output revis up, partli new
 benchmark number. actual output somewhat
 anticip continu project low side '94,
 you've got bigger gap. two essenti element
 framework. on gap sai someth futur inflat
 nomin and/or real interest rate sai someth real
 output growth. bond yield lower anticip
 earlier; don't know real rate, least nomin rate
 lower. short rate inflat [is higher], suggest
 lower real rate.
 so, ex ant, on would look set thing
 sai:
 well, forecast impli split
 nomin gdp would less inflat output. instead, get
 opposit. bigger gap yet lower output growth
 almost percentag point 1994, bigger gap
 higher inflat. i'd curiou [to learn] thing must
 chang, thing equal would gotten
 opposit. would expect output, less inflat. so,
 thing chang framework produc
 combin higher inflat lower output gdp?
 mr. prell. well, presid jordan, that's kind
 complic question i'd write week
 advanc, think, abl justic answer it. don't
 think i've absorb thread. have, obvious,
 forecast 1993 substanti less favor mix output
 increas inflat. we've gotten much lower growth
 anticip inflat run somewhat higher. now,
 curious, unemploy rate higher
 anticip; lower, need taken
 account well.
 furthermor, look revis nation incom
 account data actual growth estim
 potenti growth, output gap we've estim tent
 point somewhat smaller thought, larger. actual
 growth revis estim potenti growth.
 so, sens gap exert disinflationari pressur
 isn't larger thought; it's probabl smaller. furthermor,
 earlier year view respons
 surg activ. think unwind now, net thu
 far year don't think help.
 would realli review lot detail abl
 give better answer question, don't think basic
 model, sens work, chang. we've
 surpris. i've suggest regard current forecast
 see underli confirm scheme we've
 appli forecast. led us littl
 confid extend disinflationari trend go
 forward. think growth '95 remain moder
 unemploy remain close it, would
 ongo disinfl. seen quit favor
 tradeoff anticip, slack shade less
 averag thu far.
 mr. jordan. follow up?
 stress fiscal packag.
 
 expect put littl
 
 9/23/93
 
 mr. prell. well, don't think affect
 tradeoff but, know, begin year
 didn't introduc fiscal packag uncertainti.
 introduc on includ fiscal stimulu want
 follow presid's lead thi.
 ultim, nearterm fiscal stimulu packag; fact, probabl move
 restraint forward time beyond anyon would anticip
 earlier. substanti amount fiscal restraint
 forecast damp aggreg demand affect
 unemploy/inflat tradeoff. well, element here,
 [such as] gasolin tax; excis tax impact sens give
 short-run deterior tradeoff. thing
 go could still happen tend
 rais price level short run rel everyon-mr. jordan.
 rais interest implic
 committe's polici second page greenbook summari
 sai "achiev middl expans path mai requir
 mainten rel low real short-term rate--to counter
 contractionari effect fiscal restraint, uncertainti
 govern polici, and, least near term, slow growth
 foreign industri economi."
 that's stronger statement--i would
 call advocaci--of monetari polici typic see
 greenbook. greenbook typic littl neutral term
 assumpt monetari polici. it's case
 real output project influenc fiscal action,
 it's posit committe gener monetari polici
 cannot us correct mistak part govern
 sector, advoc monetari polici futur
 differ would absenc fiscal packag,
 sai monetari polici adjust
 fiscal regim.
 mr. prell. well, two thing on could sai. on
 monetari polici can't adjust offset shock
 chang fiscal polici. don't think there's econom basi
 statement. mai difficulti
 can't anticip precis occur without shift
 monetari polici uncertainti also
 effect monetari polici chang be. so,
 uncertainti mai lead think might desir

 ted, nafta [assumpt]?
 
 mr. truman. continu nafta assumpt
 we've past, legisl pass.
 note greenbook light recent nois, mai put
 wai, mai somewhat less "gimm" putt
 regard earlier. thought bit implic
 might be, larg--at least short term--revolv
 around impact mexico, secondari impact unit
 state. seen year mexican growth slow
 substanti. appear us combin tighter
 polici mexico face rise current
 account deficit uncertainti associ nafta
 level capit inflow. therefor, next year, assumpt
 nafta would pass, move mexican growth somewhat
 percentag point.
 absenc [nafta], regard
 increas growth problemat--i think that's wai put
 greenbook. moreov, think would downward
 pressur peso and, therefor, would drag
 export unit state result failur nafta.
 that's far we've gone.
 mr. angel. two question mike. mike,
 look interest rate forecast place
 look eci number page i-14 greenbook, i'm wonder
 happen pension contribut. period
 interest rate behav forecast, assum
 end 1994 might upward pressur short-term
 rate, would make much differ regard impact
 eci pension plan fund come pressur--that is, given
 assumpt rate return built in?
 
 9/23/93
 
 mr. prell. well, we've allud problem last
 coupl greenbook great deal discuss

 mr. angel. time, person retir
 approach retir count short-term fund
 invest, like current continu downward
 pressur consum spend segment due fact
 perceiv reduct invest incom?
 mr. prell. think it's possibl. it's also possibl--i
 don't think much evid, though i've ask businessmen
 whether perceiv thi--that peopl mai opt earli

 mr. angel. last question statement
 regard substanti fiscal restraint. substanti wasn't exactli

 might have.
 
 mr. angel. --adject regard fiscal restraint. yet
 on look congression budget offic forecast think
 even own, budget deficit doesn't chang much

 billion would [constitut] declin percentag gdp, i'd like
 explain call "substanti" fiscal restraint.
 mr. prell. well, number term unifi budget

 drop, exampl, fiscal '93 fiscal '94 exclud
 deposit insur program order $40 billion. look

 chairman greenspan.
 
 vice chairman.
 
 vice chairman mcdonough.
 could ask refer back
 interest rate model discuss present
 whether polici implic regard rel small
 chang fed fund rate?
 on sai would
 merit eas, would appear model would sai
 still consider bang 3 percent fed fund rate buck
 transmit time, model suggest,
 lower medium- long-term interest rate. hand,
 increas fed fund rate by, sai, 25 basi point,
 model suggest chang expect could rather
 signific effect real economi restrain invest
 effect medium- longer-term rate?
 mr. prell. no. said, simpl model;
 small upward movement go begin process alter
 move averag, model reach back sever year.
 so, it's go major effect. think ask
 whether model someth want reli reach
 judgment, though. question low rate
 go order get outcom want fast want
 get there? want patient? believ rate
 might [move] model suggest, quick enough you?
 would rather acceler process cut rate further,
 know ultim probabl go revers

 go essenti meaningless.
 vice chairman mcdonough.
 chairman greenspan.
 
 thank you.
 
 presid parri.
 
 mr. parri. rather slow declin
 unemploy rate greenbook forecast there's declin
 now.
 mr. prell.
 
 right.
 
 mr. parri. includ upward revis
 growth trend product higher potenti output well.

 on look growth rate, real growth rate appear
 roughli equal case growth rate potenti.
 small progress made inflat area? think
 mention health care, gasolin tax, etc., seem
 though it's surprisingli small progress.
 
 9/23/93
 
 mr. prell. okai, let address coupl thing
 briefli. on that, gaug now, believ
 reason estim potenti output growth time perhap
 shade 2-1/2 percent. so, it's close growth rate
 output project. so,
 thing equal, on would expect unemploy rate reason
 stabl. short-run uncertainti labor forc
 remain weak side, on might
 particip.
 anticip lower unemploy rate.
 rejuven suddenli,
 unemploy rate could easili go higher. i'd sai, look variou
 model, slight upsid risk unemploy.
 inflat forecast, basic we've
 3-1/4 percent past year core cpi.
 see edg
 3 percent next year so.
 line variou model look at. would give
 deceler less.
 bit less favor
 hope year ago, sai, least begin
 year. remain concern certain momentum
 suppli expect, still adjust downward
 among household, appear 3 percent area. think
 part disinfl process gradual adapt
 expect kind inflat; near term tend
 keep wage increas littl higher would otherwis be.
 think we're reason middl ground, given uncertainti
 feel.
 base experi past year so,
 think would littl aggress point lower
 forecast further.
 mr. parri.
 
 thank you.
