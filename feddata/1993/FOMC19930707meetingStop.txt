 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. staff circulated memorandum
 [on monetary aggregate includes bond stock mutual funds]
 assume you've read it. Nonetheless, would useful
 us broad overview Ms. Danker.
 MS. DANKER.
 
 [Statement--see Appendix.]
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 Questions Ms. Danker?
 
 MR. BOEHNE. data gathering costs involved
 something like M2+ [unintelligible].
 MS. DANKER. Well, data gathering costs
 incurred investment companies provide us mutual
 funds data. access data entirely ICI
 point.
 want enhance quality data
 considerably, entails first level dealing ICI
 convincing would good idea convincing
 let us deal funds one-on-one terms editing data.
 are, course, alternatives--vendors sell data.
 ICI seems best series aggregate basis.
 MR. KOHN. We, course, legal authority force
 mutual funds report us.
 It's like deposit data used
 calculate reserve requirements. worked ICI
 setting weekly data series--they consulted us last
 summer that--and money market funds data.
 torn;
 would like data; want cooperative.
 hand, don't want put burdens membership.
 entirely voluntary hear lot complaining
 members call excessively clear data anomalies. So,
 there's quite bit tension score Board staff ICI
 staff even money market funds data.
 MR. PARRY. going end-of-week collection
 anyway, independent prodding? Don't end-of-month
 data?
 MR. KOHN. Well, experimental process way

 MR. PARRY.
 improvement.
 
 that's daily average?
 No, it's not;
 
 it's still one-day number.
 
 plan now, would
 
 MR. KOHN. Yes, absolutely. Still, there's issue
 checking data, looking anomalies, calling funds back
 forth, there's lot appetite that.
 Now, maybe one
 thing could help subsidize problem.
 think problem tension; don't [want to]
 involve members much.
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 MR. SYRON. happened talk five people
 funds industry recently; coincidentally. raised
 question feel this; got memo.
 Two points:
 One is--these economists funds--that
 thought idea crazy first place. beyond that, even
 favor it, expected would lot
 internal difficulty data processing people [at time]
 trying cut costs; thought would quite
 difficult. Then, raised several technical questions things
 we'd do. There's lot concern this, including
 theoretical foundation. Also, set boundary
 include include that's spendable?
 beyond
 would new venture us, using data don't really
 control sense.
 MR. KOHN. money market funds data already
 M2 it's small piece.
 MR. SYRON. even practical level, independent
 one thinks value this--which personally think
 questionable--it would quite difficult.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. getting impression
 would quite concerned numbers becoming part
 policymaking Congress require
 something?
 MR. SYRON.
 
 Exactly.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, getting objective
 appraisal view difficulty getting data?

 MR. SYRON. No, probably not.

 legislation sort thing, become very,
 nervous step see makes liabilities closer

 wouldn't surprised, say, case
 
 would become quite difficult

 MR. PARRY. Well, addition that, don't exactly
 strongest case could made need it! study

 think plausible possibility
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 publish limited period time experimental
 basis. that's possible difficult
 would say, isn't much [promise] there.
 thought Debbie Danker forthcoming toward oral
 comments earlier versions [of memo that] read.
 difficult pick without asbestos gloves!
 MR. BROADDUS.
 It's hard think measure
 would ever useful operationally given changing asset
 values affect it.
 That's fundamental conceptual
 problem me. I'd like ask Debbie:
 thought
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 anything like shift adjusting this, using inflow data--the way
 dealt M1 period back early 1980s--as opposed
 would still data problems
 using stock concept?
 difficulties, least you'd get rid major
 conceptual issue.
 MS. DANKER. think data inflows--rather
 formally shift adjusting aggregate--are helpful looking
 developments M2 figuring it's [behaving] vis-avis path. Feinman/Porter work last year looked using
 aggregate cumulated inflows. that's
 satisfying viewing terms aggregate one thinks
 capital gains occurred 10 years ago counting money
 today. shorter-term basis thinking inflows
 kind shift adjustment think helpful.
 MR. KOHN. problem that,
 outflows could exceed inflows capital gain
 people taking could funny looking [number].
 could use inflow data help analyze M2 rather trying
 build artificial aggregate doesn't capital gains.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. can't really. gross
 flows used M1 early on? guess I'm quite clear you're
 saying.
 MR. BROADDUS. Well, formal shift adjustment

 Yes.

 MR. LINDSEY. Conceptually, differ? People
 couldn't write check capital gains 10 years ago,
 use phrase. now. Isn't really innovation,
 nature consumer product, made us suspicious
 M2-related? [why] wouldn't stock-adjustment-type
 [process] looking flows appropriate?
 MS. DANKER. Well, think stock adjustment
 process, it's going period time
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 isn't brave new world something like that.
 So, maybe we'd
 want shift adjust while. explosion

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Jordan.
 
 MR. JORDAN. couple conceptual problems
 relate Larry Mike discussing. One
 careful distinction value dollar
 value assets denominated dollars. Even net
 inflows, environment we're stabilizing
 purchasing power dollar inflation premium interest
 rates coming down, capital gains would indicate
 policy expansionary fact anti-inflationary
 reverse. got period people expected value
 dollar decline interest rates rise, value
 funds would fall, indicating policy restrictive. comment
 accurate picture thrust policy comes
 relating nominal GDP. Committee accepting
 stabilizing purchasing power dollar objective,
 measure policy central bank objective--not targeting

 MR. KOHN. think time two wouldn't
 much different.
 would assert capital gains losses
 would make good predictor nominal GDP. It's partly
 fortuitous events--the changing way people react yield curve

 MR. KOHN. number alternatives Board
 could contemplate terms publishing this, including making

 MR. MULLINS. One could call M2 plus flows stocks

 Regarding national picture, basic forecast

 Beyond this, Richmond think it's reasonable expect least

 MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, theme afternoon

 fiscal policy may coming back dialogue bit
 strongly, assuming dominant role may
 earlier eras. Recently think economy working
 dynamics, monetary policy key fiscal policy

 think it's coming back.
 Like monetary policy course inflation, think fiscal

 One relates numbers actually

 MR. PRELL.
 
 Yes, that's total budget, that's--
 
 MR. LINDSEY.
 MR. PRELL.
 
 That's incremental fiscal drag.
 Right, programs--
 
 MR. LINDSEY. Yes, it's incremental fiscal drag sixtenths percent GDP. Roughly first year multiplier
 fiscal drag close one; probably goes little that.
 So, means we're going knock six-tenths percent
 whatever [rate economy] would grown--I don't know
 rate would we're talking number 2-1/2
 3 percent--just normal old fiscal drag. knock sixtenths off, don't get median forecast; get something

 one hand, could see decline long-term

 Now, depending much short-term rates went

 MR. LINDSEY. Right. Given we're talking

 whether velocity trend would positive negative zero?
 MR. KOHN. Well, logic saying it'll

 MR. LINDSEY.
 
 Right, okay.
 
 MR. KOHN. think chances are, though,

 MR. SYRON. Don, question bit pedagogic

 think question terribly difficult period

 Given increased
 difficulty we've had, unstable velocity, setting range

 I'm coming
 whether intellectual case wider range.
 MR. KOHN. think intellectual case

 annual predictions remarkably close though

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, know something, namely

 MR. KOHN. No, President Broaddus, take account

 since baseline like Greenbook forecast, discussed
 yesterday little pessimistic inflation relative

 MR. PRELL. It's hard look recent period,

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think it's premature

 presupposes M2 going
 
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, think tighter M2 path,
 discussing Governor Lindsey underlying notion
 things would come back normal alignment, suggests
 difficulty that.
 4 4-3/4 percent M2 growth
 partly yield curve flattening. think that's
 factor, mentioned before. yield curve
 flattening highly unusual alignment right now,
 process--it's sort Governor Angell saying--will push
 M2 growth least time. So, it's hard know what's
 consistent price stability.
 MR. KEEHN. Would uncomfortable going

 extreme uncertainty. obviously continue follow

 questions are:
 (a) Would uncomfortable taking kind
 position; (b) risks?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First all, don't think it's
 necessary it.
 would feel uncomfortable trying
 forecast M2. We're basically forecasting ad hoc adjustments
 velocity, forecasting it.
 Congress insists
 focusing issue committed statutorily
 actually making projections, would feel uncomfortable
 basically saying stuff nonsense
 it.
 That's next argument, leave ranges
 unchanged saying they're worth anything, [relates to]
 publishing them. deluding public?
 we're we're trying forecast M2. saying
 old relationship M2 economy broken
 we're still forecasting M2 it's better try forecast
 improve chances get actual growth range basically
 say we're even trying. think crucial question
 all. crucial question relationship M2
 economy. argue wholly technical grounds
 forecasting M2 required best estimate 1 2 percent
 [growth] range we're setting 1 5 percent, example,
 least we're forecasting M2. We're saying means
 much we've argued doesn't mean much,
 least we're saying means nothing. It's big deal
 ask would feel comfortable going 1 5

 I'd feel little comfortable 1 5 percent range.
 it's Committee's view nothing, wouldn't

 invites one possibly two charges. first
 lowered nominal GNP target midpoint 3 percent
 midpoint 4 percent. think 3 percent probably low

 year come, I'm much worried would send

 keep 2 6 percent range--though understand you're saying
 --to avoid short-run charge we're cutting nominal GNP

 would like pursue

 something, don't know lot.
 Point one seems
 one know make change keep something same,
 it's matter judgment whether know enough make

 we're targeting M2.
 So, answer question:
 know enough lower [the range for] know enough
 forecast it, monetary aggregate and, central bank,

 don't try? doesn't forecast element

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, that's side
 argument; legitimate argument. question basically

 it's close argument.
 MR. BOEHNE. Well, seems you're going
 explaining answer questions--there's nothing wrong
 that--if make change, especially year, don't.
 agree it's close call you're one [testify].
 it's close enough call-What pros
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let ask Don:
 cons staying year lowering tentatively

 MR. KOHN. I'm fairly confident, isn't confident

 I'm saying

 MR. ANGELL. But, Tom, may well velocity

 is, rate change velocity goes zero go back

 seems
 one might make good case go zero

 Doesn't 1 5

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 President Forrestal.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. Well, wanted say
 already said. think you're quite right arguments
 finely balanced here. Let say first seems
 we've talking long time difficulties M2
 uncertainties surrounding change
 range midyear would drawing attention M2 think
 deserves. really reflects precision agree have.
 think would desirable lower ranges 1994,
 think would better let year run change

 ranges 1993. We'll accused chasing M2.
 importantly, mind would draw attention
 aggregate really deserves. Now, 1994 different question;
 think ought announce February now.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don, let ask question
 probability. probability, judgment, M2 could
 sudden accelerate context, say,
 words, basically,
 economy continuing move modestly?
 probability velocity fall?
 MR. KOHN. judgment probability would
 small, given current shape yield curve.

 we're going miss range that's higher anyway. Then,

 opportunity lower technical reasons

 think significant indication yesterday auto

 Nonetheless, odd combination effects

 far forecast concerned. look extent
 fiscal restraint context Greenbook did, measure
 relatively modest degree restraint one cannot readily
 argue there's much way ex post receipts

 quite interesting, think apparent, one looks
 process develops psychological anticipatory
 aspects involved fiscal package really order
 magnitude seems almost larger actual impact. I'm
 saying that's true; I'm saying incredible

 credible reduction deficit somewhere there. suspect
 is, rightly wrongly.
 [Lower interest rates]
 unquestionably major factor improvement balance

 reduction fairly substantial debt service burdens.
 It's rather
 obvious point, however, offsetting impact
 negative side--on contraction real variables--is tax
 side and, least based anecdotal discussions around
 table yesterday, capital goods markets respect number
 projects put hold. It's tough see
 data yet. place actually materializes
 nondefense durable goods numbers.
 Surely, doesn't get picked

 So, there's anything there,

 So, looking economy arguably

 would conclude, unless hard

 almost surely best positioned maintain [conditions

 So, think we're looking process.
 unless see clear evidence things

 looking data, suppose one

 Also, think suggestion particularly appropriate that, given

 actually thoughtful letter I've ever
 received Mr. Gonzalez.
 credible letter strikes
 much point. He's pounding table; he's
 making serious point. basic notion leaks
 public statements FOMC meetings serious matter
 calls question credibility Federal Reserve manage
 operations. That's argument difficult get
 at. issue leaks really part much broader problem,
 think we've got give thought. Clearly,
 demise fiscal policy extraordinary point focus
 fact organization powerful element within
 government and, indeed, considering aspects
 way policy implemented, don't think question
 that. Secondly, large part result extraordinary
 elevation press consequence Watergate episode,
 we've created large increase investigative reporting
 capacity. much larger number competent,
 economically educated press people working world finance
 time memory. CEA--that
 1975-76--there nothing like technical capability lot
 reporters have. could feed pabulum
 pretty much accepted it.
 clearly changed quite dramatically.
 Now, thought yesterday sitting
 listening economic discussion, listening one
 talk way economy functioning economic
 activity, inflation, outlook, words

 you:
 it, they. presumption go
 talk economy without conveying something
 [about policy views] strikes really mark.
 personally think Wall Street Journal leak came
 room.
 [David Wessel] almost invariably say
 information came Fed officials, senior Fed officials,
 Administration officials, government officials. don't know
 remember article said "people familiar
 Federal Reserve functions," code word half
 people probably meant mean somebody used

 legion. direct information, suspect would said so.
 point didn't need direct information. One
 infer quite reasonably policy outcome last meeting
 one sits telerate screen reads one us

 part job communicate various constituents.

 It's something people

 around town long period time.
 It's really

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. CNBC thing pure, unadulterated

 MR. BOEHNE.
 
 Right.
 
 MR. SYRON. got shortly [announced

 "Well,

 MR. BOEHNE. saying believe somebody like
 David Wessel write article talk anybody

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think talked lot people

 (3) Anything economy policy one week

 (4) detailed outlook economy,

 (5) performance government officials.
 "Issues Available Discussion" are:
 (1) Broad trends economy, provided discussion
 sufficiently vague balanced make drawing implications
 future policy impossible.
 (2) Broad policy objectives mechanism techniques
 implementing policy.
 (3) matters public record, recent
 testimony.
 (4) Economic conditions region.
 (5) Background economic research already publicly released.
 Needless say, areas bank regulation, community
 development, whole variety things
 Federal Reserve's bailiwick, discussions perfectly appropriate

 That's important period.
 
 MR. ANGELL. That's important period. anyone

 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, perhaps ought remind
 Committee briefly several occasions last six
 eight months consider question whether
 release information immediately. Mullins' subcommittee
 full open discussion issue. members
 Committee tended favor immediate release, were,
 think, minority; certainly, one moved change situation.
 concerns Committee time questions
 flexibility policymaking, whether immediate announcement
 directive, say, like asymmetric directive May, would constrain
 Committee going asymmetry wouldn't want
 announcement effect.
 fact, effect markets
 raising interest rates; weren't sure, going raise
 rates. constraining [the ability of] Committee take actions
 go asymmetric directive asymmetry symmetry,
 would sense remove small amounts
 flexibility Committee. concern Committee had.
 issue need think you're
 considering going immediate release release.
 May, example, right meeting Committee released
 fact gone asymmetric directive would
 significantly called reporters? One wonder. least
 would wonder whether reporters wouldn't
 Committee members wondering done
 circumstances change would made.
 [But] would help [to release
 information] meetings would stop right there,
 think, Committee announced decision.
 question release along far
 go.
 So, couple issues raised
 Committee last discussed this.
 MR. LAWARE.
 didn't intend make brief immediate
 release. case, even believed right way
 go--and I'm sure do--I wouldn't light
 Congressman would declare victory say "Now I've got them."

 wouldn't sit still that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must humbly retract statement

 direction not.
 exact, sentences
 think reasonable.
 MR. KELLEY.
 think said, Mr. Chairman,

 [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. think Governor LaWare
 appropriately characterized it.
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -79-
 
 MR. PARRY. two questions. prohibition 7 days
 7 days meeting something Joe Coyne
 repeated quite often 7 years I've here.
 number people obviously disregard completely. often
 get back next day I'll see three four people given
 speech day [the FOMC meeting].
 assume think
 reason [prohibition] mistake.
 that's case,
 I'd like hear objections are. may legitimate
 shouldn't it. frankly think wise thing,
 obviously people feel though
 prohibition violate time. So,
 violate time, assume would unhappy talking
 why.
 MR. ANGELL. Bob, I'm concerned people
 violate names violate without
 names.
 MR. PARRY. I'm talking talking press. I'm
 saying speeches scheduled; get wires, etc. Yet,
 thought consensus would give speeches
 dealing economy 7 days 7 days [an FOMC
 meeting].
 Obviously, people don't know or, knowing it,
 don't think respected. would interesting know
 is.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. anybody speech scheduled
 Humphrey-Hawkins?
 MR. PARRY.
 case.
 
 Well, go back look at--
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I'm denying truth
 You're talking historically; I'm talking on.
 MR. PARRY.
 
 Okay.
 
 none us answers
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. say this:
 press call, way anything leak tell
 somebody else tells press.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, telling someone else every bit bad,
 worse telling press.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 course.
 
 MR. LAWARE.
 
 Sure.
 
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Telling somebody else even suspicious.
 
 MR. PARRY. second question. I'm sure fully
 understand point made talking economy
 way policy implications.
 one concerns
 inflation, example, saying view never
 articulated public?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I'm saying, example, get
 public say inflation serious problem
 something quickly, statement
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -80-
 
 position monetary policy. say it's role central
 bank maintain stable prices, that's philosophical judgment
 respect nature institution, hopefully
 subscribe to. broad principles something enunciate
 whenever can.
 MR. ANGELL. You're [able to] read [people's views policy]
 better I. hear people saying inflation problem
 don't know they're going vote I've seen make
 statement inflation problem. four
 five people made statements inflation problem
 and, frankly, don't know they're going vote based upon
 say. don't understand think reporters know
 they're going vote.
 MR. LAWARE.
 MR. SYRON.
 
 don't make mistake you, though!
 Consistency.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Remember problem is;
 record six weeks fact. So, it's question, really,
 one characterizes things. main concern, frankly, less
 saying views
 inadvertently conveying nature position
 Committee overall.
 times, cite innumerable
 instances, sentences members sitting around
 table slipped Q&As like--[sentences that]
 characterized [the view of] organization whole. think
 something careful about.
 MR. FORRESTAL. business talking people
 raises question mind I've quite long time.

 question whether Administration might leaking
 information. kind arrangement
 talk Administration?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let put way.
 two years ago, would say, conventional thing
 Chairman Fed convey chairman CEA
 policy was; part discussion. became apparent
 hole large one imagine.

 talked either Bush Administration Clinton Administration
 policy matters initiated Committee room. must
 say one see Administration officials-MR. ANGELL.
 
 much one used to.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's right.
 
 MR. FORRESTAL. beneficial one sense,
 makes problem even acute two issues here.
 One is: leaks deliberate? CNBC report certainly
 pointed deliberate leak. First, go back John LaWare's
 remark letter, agree it's attack; doesn't

 way diminish seriousness pointing to.
 think credibility institution really line
 deliberate leaks. know deliberate leaks,
 think obligation track something
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -81-
 
 them. inadvertent leaks talking reporters think
 corrected large extent following guidelines.
 think follow religiously keep
 mind. third point I'd make David Wessel get
 information sources outside Fed, there's really nothing
 that, seems me.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Frankly, didn't particularly mind
 David Wessel piece fact picking guess
 judgment organization might function.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 Yes, he's guessing talking
 
 people.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. reason appears [that way]
 didn't something usually done, namely, quote lot
 people. conceivable characterizing
 situation correctly. said before, sole piece evidence
 historic knowledge policy Wall Street Journal
 respect designating sources.
 MR. FORRESTAL.
 
 Yes, think that's logical conclusion.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. true, I'd say-Well, Wessel long period quite secure.
 MR. SYRON. difficulty comes back
 John LaWare said disclosure. Committee
 discussion that.
 time discussion think
 somewhat better recent history leaks. Regardless one
 interprets Wessel situation, CNBC matter clearly leak
 sort another. face it, unless demonstrate
 relatively short period time leak problem
 eliminated, course time choice go
 disclosure. It's simple. demonstrated
 organization capacity [prevent leaks] [as result] we're
 destroying credibility organization things
 we're trying terms objectives. So, unless
 really get point very, quickly, better start
 thinking seriously want release.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 couldn't agree more.
 
 think that's correct.
 
 MR. KEEHN. think that's exactly right, question
 whether time make happen.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, two possibilities coming
 right here. decide want change
 disclosure [practices]; could ask Mullins subcommittee
 review previous [material this] come back
 recommendation. say don't wish change; think
 procedures we're using appropriate effective
 workings organization. Then, event leak,
 request General Counsel ask sworn statements
 voluntarily individuals room
 communicate particular press person.
 gets point
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -82-
 
 would ask voluntary sworn statements.
 work, I'd say choice to-MR. SYRON.
 latter, too.
 MR. KEEHN.
 
 doesn't
 
 time constraints, I'd prefer
 would statements voluntary?
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. legal means
 one enforce sworn statement members Board
 Governors.
 MR. KEEHN. Well, think ought find way getting
 [rid of] anybody willing give statement.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 would suggest it?
 
 MR. KEEHN. think Chairman Board puts
 freeze anybody table, he's gone.
 MR. ANGELL.
 MR. KEEHN.
 effect gone.
 
 Wait minute.
 
 talking about?
 
 Chairman puts freeze somebody,
 
 MR. ANGELL. Members Board Governors

 MR. KEEHN.
 
 understand that.
 
 MR. ANGELL. Now, there's question pact
 enter into, one another. Chairman says,
 information doesn't belong us [as

 individuals.]
 certainly can't understand comment, Si.
 blows mind one seven-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 understandable frustration.
 
 Well, don't chalk
 
 MR. JORDAN. Part thinking Bob Forrestal

 come conclusion did. said "familiar

 interpret
 mean somebody claimed position knowing happened
 meeting [unintelligible]-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. He's done often never
 used phrase.
 It's much credible say:
 "A Fed official
 said that..."
 MR. JORDAN. Yes, it's Fed official--if it's
 Administration official-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let put way.
 extraordinarily scrupulous indicating Secretary
 Treasury, Chairman Council Economic Advisors,
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -83-
 
 anybody, meeting. never even acknowledged
 leaks true.
 MR. JORDAN. Well, whether Fed official not,
 associate Wayne's point "for record
 background."
 worked town '81 '82, took
 position one off-the-record statements.
 either record don't say it.
 trouble
 town many people agree me. people
 Washington press know that, people work-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. must say don't agree that.
 think issue whether it's record record
 say occasions want convey
 [some] information without name known [unintelligible]
 organization disabuse certain people certain views
 without ending confrontation quarrel. So, don't agree
 that. Wayne knows disagree that.
 MR. ANGELL.
 
 Sure.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. don't disagree
 content he's saying.
 MR. MCTEER. practical matter, isn't main argument
 immediate release directive problem asymmetric
 directives?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 That's crucial thing.
 
 MR. MCTEER. don't go ahead stop
 asymmetric directives start releasing directive
 leave room understanding telephone
 conferences moment's notice intermeeting decisions?
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. much less efficient
 means working way we're working.
 MR. MCTEER. would eliminate problems
 speech-making times meeting that.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 MR. MCTEER.
 
 doubt that.
 
 Well, least after.
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No. David, committee
 concluded looking possibilities-MR. MULLINS. Yes. basically I'm one people
 believe releasing asymmetric directives measurably increases
 think
 flexibility efficiency monetary policymaking.
 served us well. argument falls it's released. think
 one can't rebut argument accelerate release.
 So, may choice formalize process accelerate
 release. Looking back it, we've number episodes
 interspersed relatively long periods success. personally
 would bit hesitant making move early release
 directive heat one episodes view
 
 7/6-7/93
 
 -84-
 
 move irreversible; forever alter opportunities
 available Committee. Again, think [delayed release]
 served us relatively well may choice. would
 agree another episode, hard rebut
 argument. preference redouble efforts maintaining
 confidentiality full knowledge we're brink losing
 flexibility. subcommittee, talked it, thought
 quite bit flexibility asymmetric directive.
 inefficiency essentially Committee meeting
 continuously, pretty close we'd required
 everyone get together. thought worth don't know
 much it's worth. It's certainly worth losing credibility
 over; practical matter credibility degenerates
 leaks. subcommittee, guess Committee
 discussion well, generally supported notion although
 people disagreed. blackout periods plus
 minus one week, directive longer period.
 Actually, it's longer period think may
 problems well.
 So, another argument line
 blackout release directive.
 MR. MCTEER.
 release directive immediately,
 would possibly ease pressure us reveal release
 conversations take place.
 MR. MULLINS.
 wouldn't they?
 
 think people would want know why, though,
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, always want know why.
 think we'd heighten interest that.
 anyone else want
 [comment]?
 MR. MELZER. Well, worked David subcommittee
 favor immediate release either; must say
 subsequent developments put different light, wouldn't
 taking another look.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let suggest following:

 make effectively last stand fail, first
 thing request General Counsel ask sworn
 statements least record.
 choose make statement, that's
 prerogative. Governor Angell right. Members Board
 Governors appointed President United States
 consent Senate independent agents good bad.
 both!
 [Laughter]
 MR. KEEHN. split hair that, thought one

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's statute I'm aware of;
 it's rules Committee.
 MR. MATTINGLY.

 It's part FOMC's Regulations.
 
 that's law?

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 It's felony.
 
 MR. MATTINGLY. information FOMC

 FOMC's rules.
 MR. KEEHN. Okay. violate law, seems
 that's different set circumstances.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 promulgate laws.
 
 legislative body
 
 MR. MCTEER. Well, like Governor Angell's objection.
 [I'd
 it] cover presidents, limit governors.
 MR. ANGELL. Well, [unintelligible] statute somewhat
 different.
 don't think want huge difference
 practice, statute quite different dismissal
 member Board Governors falls impeachment clause.
 It's specified. presidents serve pleasure
 Board Governors. practice, certainly wouldn't want
 way; we'd look pretty silly ever-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
 
 It's legal distinction
 
 cannot--
 
 MR. SYRON. five-year terms anyway?
 you're right; that's separate issue.
 
 think
 
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. understand that's statute
 says.
 practical matter couldn't function Committee
 different status different members Committee
 won't work. important thing I'd say particular

 end Humphrey-Hawkins hearings--on 22nd July

 Believe me,
 it's mirage; miss once. think
