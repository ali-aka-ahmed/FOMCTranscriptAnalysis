 keenly aware slowdown U.S. economy would affect world economy.
 Now, building sharp slowdown world economy

 MS. MINEHAN. you’re basically agnostic output gap—or lack thereof—
 see current unemployment rate. don’t believe it’s whack

 they’re slight influences performance inflation remainder year

 now.
 MR. STOCKTON. Two interpretations recent readings: One interpretation

 NAIRU lower we’re estimating. case would gap
 unemployment rate: 4.7 percent might equal 4.7 natural rate, output gap would
 zero. obviously has, illustrated Greenbook, beneficial implications

 imply higher future inflation. Again, within normal errors Okun’s law—despite name
 “law,” it’s pretty loose empirical relationship [laughter]—we don’t really see necessarily calling
 question estimates yet. think reasonable alternative interpretations
 what’s happened recently ones providing Greenbook.

 Turning national economy, Greenbook presents, President Moskow noted,
 distinctly different picture six weeks ago, perhaps notably regard consumer
 spending. Lower growth household income since middle last year led staff
 reduce estimate level real disposable income quarter 1 percent,
 reduced estimate consumption quarter 0.4 percent. Greenbook also marks
 consumption growth ½ percent second half ’06 ¼ percent ’07.
 Now, certainly reasonable expect lower current income affect current consumption

 Greenbook. Growth real disposable income forecast bounce back second half.

 greater concern me, however, inflation outlook. Three issues related inflation
 particularly troublesome. First, core inflation outside range many us

 gotten much attention noise. implication way blunts fact even
 
 June 28-29, 2006

 Second, many noted recent jump core CPI driven increase
 owners’ equivalent rent. Again, work staff done decomposing core CPI, looking back
 period low inflation well recent period, clearly implies recent
 increase owners’ equivalent rent surprise number driven
 fundamentals demand homeownership relative rental demand. interest rates

 third last concern relates ability, perhaps willingness, near term

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let outline comments
 business contacts first. Wal-Mart—and Richard talked bit—has substantial piece
 business, means it, lower-income consumers. coming
 several hundred basis points plan since Easter, that’s entire business. That’s
 pretty substantial hit world’s largest retailer—of course, that’s mostly U.S. business.
 pronounced paycheck cycle. example contact gave right
 receiving paychecks, generally come end month middle month,
 consumers buying large economy-size packages stuff comes way. go
 month, next paycheck, buying increasingly smaller quantities.
 They’re running liquidity next paycheck comes. Wal-Mart still many
 applicants every job. average, expanding, ten applicants
 every job.
 contact J.B. Hunt said general perception economy
 slowing. Hunt and, think, many truck companies expanding fleets.
 fact, Hunt cut back truck fleet shortage drivers. contact said
 there’s dire—that word—shortage drivers; shortage worse ever
 seen it. But—and think interesting—Hunt responding wage increases beyond
 normal 3 4 percent year. talked contact that, said
 ready raise wages. manage business telling people “the truck
 capacity available; go someplace else.” trying push customers
 higher-cost deliveries Hunt, customers may go way may go someplace else.

 Greenbook discussed large truck issue new truck engine requirements.
 That’s going produce large cycle large trucks. guess companies producing
 large trucks engines fully occupied year, there’s going slack

 FedEx contact said see weakness part business except
 domestic express. What’s happening that, high fuel surcharges

 agreements things escape ECI. expect FedEx follow pretty

 want make couple general comments. Greenbook certainly
 pretty strong business capital spending projection. view that, recent years, companies
 rather contained constrained capital expenditures, firms worked hard
 disciplined cost control make sure didn’t expand capacity really needed it.
 course, corporate profits done well. many companies little
 excess capacity, putting place capacity. FedEx contact said FedEx
 increasing capital expenditures year, 75 percent spending capacity
 expansion. recent years, much larger fraction productivity improvement rather
 capacity expansion. think expansion capacity reflects business optimism
 long run. plans long period connected them. Even though
 expansion involves items, like computers, purchased shelf,
 items part much longer term plan. don’t think part economy vulnerable
 quick turnaround.
 slower growth consumption likely reflects pressures lower-income
 consumers, limited spending capacity, perhaps many consumers,
 saving rate already low. maybe we’re seeing long-awaited long-desired
 shift composition GDP toward business investment less consumption,

 change mix would healthy. Yet come would evidence change toward
 higher net exports, would change composition less consumption, less
 housing, business investment.
 There’s lot discussion energy pass-through. I’m going make
 assertion that’s probably little bold, think it’s basically correct: energy prices stay
 are, long run full pass-through must occur. Companies can’t absorb energy
 costs forever. Full pass-through must occur, pass-through occurs several ways. One
 way, UPS FedEx surcharges, put business.
 going absorb those. types pass-through occur companies’
 substituting energy-saving technology—for example, reduce energy intensity—but
 technologies don’t come free. they’re going include costs substitutions
 do. changes mix goods produced
 consumed, change mix away express air toward ground service.
 energy pass-through complete long run. we’re going avoid long-run effect
 price level, higher energy prices must offset lower prices elsewhere,
 becomes change relative prices without effect aggregate price level. wanted
 make comment looks though we’re situation oil
 expected remain around $70 barrel indefinite future adjustments going
 taking place continuously. ought work assumption there’s going
 complete pass-through.

 MR. LACKER. Bill, isn’t way people using “pass-through” around
 here. I’ve taken “pass-through” mean increase overall core rate, think that’s
 way everyone else used it. scenario describe wouldn’t result pass-through,
 way example President Yellen used term. right?
 MR. POOLE. Part we’ve looking individual cases.
 recently, example, passenger airlines unable pass fuel increases, whereas
 UPSes FedExes world able pass through. eventually,
 passenger airlines pass they’re unprofitable don’t. price
 increases pass through.
 MR. LACKER. understand that, Bill.
 MR. POOLE. We’ve using term way understanding
 underlying pricing power firms have. Firms absorb cost increases short run,
 can’t absorb long run. happen secondary effects
 show level core unless put downward pressure non-energy-related parts,

 That’s point I’m trying make.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Incoming data tended confirm

 markdown growth prospects. Notably, worry added inflation pressures
 confined United States, given strong growth abroad, high energy commodity prices,
 sense output close potential. Widespread policy tightening greater

 incoming data certainly influenced projections—I expect less growth

 this. decline unemployment rate noticeably 5 percent occurred

 Finally, I’d like talk housing affects liquidity monetary policy

 note durable goods orders, though incredibly robust past month, represent

 nondefense capital goods. all, think data suggest positive trend.
 I’d like spend little time talking markets reacted
 news build couple points Dino made outset. First, lot pundits
 described “new volatility” marketplace, think Dino made

 Let make two three comments. First, terms inflation, look
 commodity markets TIPS markets, I’m comforted much relative
 moves, TIPS markets certainly perfect describing inflation expectations,
 responsiveness markets remarks come folks around

 real-time changes TIPS markets give comfort point cycle
 able, proper appropriate policies we’ll discuss tomorrow, change
 inflation expectations rather dramatically. think that’s reasonably comforting idea.

 Finally, fixed-income markets high-yield markets certainly moved higher

 more-pessimistic market conditions now, move, even small relative move,

 Turning inflation outlook, people mentioned publicly

 Basically, within days meeting May 10, almost major commodities,
 whether copper, gold, whichever one want, came peak. Since then, oil come

 That’s something ultimately control directly. today’s circumstances,

 considerable unease recent inflation developments. Everyone considered recent

 Let add thoughts situation. situation is, think, exceptionally
 complicated least three different things going on. First all, there’s cyclical
 transition period above-trend growth would hope would period
 trend growth, normal soft-landing problem. Second, essentially supply shock. It’s

 commodity prices rising significantly, creating worsened tradeoff. Third,
 housing cycle certain autonomous component it’s like
 asset-price correction taking place schedule, speak, interacting
 two forces. given three things occurring time, situation
 obviously complicated.
 Now, ideal situation would us move steady, sustainable pace without
 inflation. Right now, biggest risk steady pace seems pickup we’ve seen
 recently inflation. main point want make inflation—many points already
 made—is really quite broad-based. think good reasons downweight,

 concerned about. also note three-month total PCE inflation rate

 Now, concern have—and many people expressed—is don’t fully

 two concrete recommendations statement. First, note June 1
 Chairman characterized recent inflation readings “unwelcome”—a important word
 harkens back word Committee used 2003 communicate lower bound
 range inflation rates Committee considered consistent price stability. use
 word today statement communicate view current inflation
 readings consistent price stability. I’m afraid failing would glaring
 omission would unnecessarily perpetuate ambiguity intentions.
 second recommendation statement assessment risk,
 first sentence alternative B, row 4, reads, “Although moderation growth
 aggregate demand help limit inflation pressures time, Committee judges
 inflation risks remain.” Placing anticipation aggregate demand slowdown front
 center assessment inflation dynamics seems odd light talk around
 table recent years flat relationship aggregate demand
 
 June 28-29, 2006

 inflation. Moreover, even sentence follows paragraph, seems imply
 we’re willing simply wait moderation inflation rather take sufficient action
 ourselves. Given Greenbook’s forecast, asks relatively modest output gap whole
 lot work. also—but sort broader doctrinal issue—risks leaving impression
 methodology controlling inflation manipulate aggregate demand, I’m
 sure that’s entirely accurate.
 assessment-of-risk sentence alternative C would much appropriate
 first sentence alternative B. states clearly would like see happen
 inflation: “In order foster price stability sustainable economic growth, Committee
 seeks medium-term decline core inflation recent elevated levels.” sense
 something everyone around table wants—a medium-term decline core inflation;
 that’s case, ought state clearly public. two changes would send
 much clearer message focus inflation risks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll start saying support 25 basis
 points today. Many us, including especially Chairman, helped shape market
 expectations we’re going today, think carry through, given
 shaped market expectations, would unfortunate.
 get statement, want try state clearly position

 disagreement well within normal forecast errors.
 Now, would characterize policy stance coming meeting, assuming

 trying say memo distributed earlier, fed funds rate
 5.25 percent would stance mild restraint. Let give short list
 things lead believe that. list particular order, although suppose it’s
 accident I’m going put money growth top list. slow and, indeed,
 slowing growth MZM (Money Zero Maturity) M2, particularly recent weeks; don’t
 put lot weight short-run information get, see consistent

 something like 50 percent odds would hold steady August 50 percent odds

 would pretty silly.

 don’t like word “readings” because—and President Yellen made good point—we
 don’t want viewed reactive. I’d prefer word “pressures”: “However, recent

 agree President Lacker—to clarify intention, would use alternative B

 would say “in order foster price stability sustainable economic growth,
 Committee seeks medium-term decline core inflation current elevated levels.”
 way, don’t like second sentence paragraph 4 current alternative B
 because, former market operator, take intend raise rates again.
 slippage revolves around words “any additional firming” word “may.”
 Again, given background, read words we’re biased toward raising rates
 again, don’t think that’s are. least that’s am. would also make

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree 25 basis point increase
 proposed. Let make couple comments. First, people used words “modest

 increased interest rates 75 basis points since January nominal terms. adjust
 inflation, that’s 30 basis points. Also, look chart 8 Bluebook look

 interesting. could them, could one other.
 accomplish objective. Gary made point didn’t like phrase “unwelcome.”
 could say, “Readings core inflation elevated recent months, that’s
 inconsistent price stability.” could something like “unwelcome.” One
 other—Sandy favored first sentence number 4—accomplishes objective,
 think including one would add statement. Finally, agree everyone said—
 Chairman’s testimony, minutes, data come going great
 impact market’s expectations August.
 one final little edit: go alternative B, first phrase number 4,
 “although moderation growth aggregate demand help limit inflation
 pressures,” doesn’t belong there. don’t disagree phrase, don’t think belongs
 number 4. really belongs number 3, way work number 3 start

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support 25 basis point move
 meeting, share objectives many people around table have. think
 may bit disagreement achieve objective words
 statement.
 first part rationale, talking lagged effects increases
 interest rates energy prices cooling housing market important
 acknowledgement implicitly gets point President
 Poole made mild restraint effects policy what’s happening
 what’s going happening going forward.
 would prefer use language mild restraint. First, agree point
 it’s hard know exactly much restraint have. think President Moskow made
 good point looking simulations Vincent given us show
 language, least interpretations, would suggest we’re really much
 restraint. Second, important communications standpoint, say now,
 future we’re always going characterize much restraint
 market. “mild restraint,” “modest,” take
 word front. think gets us bad dynamic. would prefer leave idea
 implicit. important there, discussion lagged effects
 policy. could even say “lagged effects current policy,” really wanted emphasize
 something like that. would prefer go way.
 respect suggestions President Lacker made, think it’s
 clear much share objectives concerns unanchoring expectations.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 124 177
 
 meetings appeared far, talked importance
 maintaining credibility know full well great costs trying reestablish credibility
 lost. said, put movements we’ve seen expectations past
 six weeks broader context, don’t think they’ve moved much. would prefer
 moving down; would prefer maintain clear credibility;
 don’t think they’ve moved lot moved way consider sufficiently large
 disturbing. point view, would averse including word “unwelcome.”
 consider word “unwelcome” unwelcome statement [laughter] don’t think
 need say convey way here. convey variety
 means. share broad objective.
 I’m bit wary trying bring alternative C language alternative B
 I’m concerned market’s focusing much specific measures start
 talking medium-term decline core inflation. may, then, overreaction
 PCE numbers CPI numbers come out, would bit concern. Something
 much like alternative B end assessment risks talk
 evolution outlook inflation economic growth, much
 forward-looking bit concrete, think valuable helps clarify
 objectives.
 Finally, something Vice Chairman Geithner brought up—I think there’s tension
 people want achieve language we’re going use achieve
 it. concur broadly comment number people made—that alternative B
 probably bring market’s odds regarding we’re going August
 recently elevated levels. We’re going getting important data. We’ll getting two
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 125 177
 
 employment reports, we’ll get see whether lower numbers employment
 temporary not. see four five months data, able start pulling
 whether something temporary not. important numbers coming up,
 support basically keeping alternative B is. think best way achieve
 objective leaving options open way unanchoring expectations.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, support 25 basis point increase
 meeting, several people said, think real issue signal going forward. Let
 refer comments already made respond colleagues. President Poole,
 I’m sort right are: I’m thinking 50-50 going forward, I’m leaning toward
 neutral language leaves options open.
 However, I’m troubled, too, Governor Kroszner said, talking position
 restraint moment. see removed excess accommodation. I’m
 concerned call restrictive want backtrack, might signal we’re
 easing again. think we’re right sweet spot, don’t really want characterize one
 way another because, again, think we’re need be.
 comment would make we’re still seeing banks loosening lending
 standards. There’s plenty liquidity there. Governor Warsh said yesterday, people
 leveraging. Pricing may restraining, liquidity. Credit spreads still very,
 minimal. perspective, market, given they’re seeing day day deal-making,
 may react asking call restrictive.
 like President Moskow’s comment moving first sentence row 4, first
 part moderation growth, rationale. spoke around table yesterday,
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 126 177
 
 trying decide signals inflation—how much inflation
 transitory much worked housing cools because, again, really
 slowdown coming. slowdown coming housing, that’s really wanted
 happen. rates rise, we’ve pulled hot sector closer want
 be. look section 3 alternative B, really laying think inflation
 headed right direction. Productivity gains still good. Unit labor costs, therefore,
 held down. Inflation expectations contained. could add points
 moderation aggregate demand also help contain inflation. However, still
 pressures. think sentence row 4 supports rationale, like suggestion
 move it.
 also agree suggestion take first word sentence, “readings
 core inflation” say “core inflation.” open saying “unwelcome”—it serves
 signal anchoring expectations. numbers high 3.8 unwelcome me,
 would glad stick word “unwelcome” there.
 thing would say number 4 would put period “outlook
 inflation economic growth.” get everybody focusing outlook we’re
 talking about. say “data dependent,” mean need data validate
 forecast modify it. think markets look data, would soon put
 period “growth.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let support move 25 basis points

 getting discussion language, maybe give couple perspectives,
 Mr. Chairman, markets themselves. sense things bit herd mentality
 remains markets waiting every utterance and, ways,
 guided us very, long time. discussion we’re today really
 tough one recognize need wean markets degree certainty
 longer possess. think discussion really quite healthy so. light
 perspective, think alternative B strikes right balance. Without trying wordsmith
 statement point, think that, although share Vince’s view ultimately markets
 get probability August balanced, take time. is, think
 markets’ first reaction alternative B various versions we’re talking
 “stickiness” view now. believe stopped giving
 guidance, we’ve gotten business, somehow culpable that.
 led river, telling really decision
 all. view shift very, good thing; going without
 pain, think swipes made us. Chairman’s monetary policy testimony
 perhaps represent little bit that.
 dispersion market views doing, state
 economy is, prospects inflation healthy thing. introducing
 volatility markets, probably meaningful way may seen,
 balance think shift good.
 backdrop—that markets focused nuance—and recognition
 discussion we’re nuance, let say things support alternative B.
 First, rationale section, say inflation expectations remain contained, think
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 128 177
 
 markets take couple shots us say, “Boy, said contained previously.
 say they’re contained now. heard between?” way get
 comfortable statement inflations expectations contained
 movements markets, inflation surveys, TIPS markets, commodities
 markets show responsive views. also feel honestly describe
 contained, container may bigger said before.
 [Laughter] guess I’m troubled that. introduced language “unwelcome,”
 markets would take reprise Chairman’s remarks weeks ago would take
 view anticipating move fed funds futures markets August.
 think view would problematic light hear central tendency people’s
 views here—that want bet fairer, closer 50-50, fear historical use
 “unwelcome” would go we’re collectively trying accomplish.
 Let make another comment, assessment risk say, “The Committee
 judges inflation risks remain.” think people markets going focus
 word “some.” “Some” recent meetings meant policy firming—that is,
 one move; “some” strong word. context, time understanding,
 2:16 2:30 even today tomorrow, they’re going recognize “some”
 actually weakens statement somewhat. Saying “some inflation risks remain” rather “the
 Committee judges inflation risks remain” will, balance, modestly lower fed funds futures
 August beyond likely bring us back point fair fight
 come August decision. think taking “some” likely good change. So,
 balance, Mr. Chairman, support alternative B. suggestions made
 characterize views vis-à-vis neutrality whether we’re mildly restrictive strike
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 129 177
 
 leading discussion markets might terribly helpful time.
 walking away markets perceive firm obvious guidance bigger move
 think discussion may suggesting, I’d rather add new notion
 neutrality, discussion whether less loose tight strikes inopportune
 moment.
 concur comment President Yellen made outset thinking
 August decision option model theory approach. approach basically don’t
 want exercise option to. Alternative B preserves options, balance,
 fair fight fair discussion come August meeting. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. quickly, think remember core PCE index
 comes tomorrow. that’s unfortunate number, it’s going right say,
 people might say, “Some inflation risk? We’ve got bad number. guys
 anyway?” would vote taking “some” saying, “Inflation risks remain.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. would read discussion
 yesterday implying central tendency forecast economy that’s growing basically
 potential forecast period trajectory inflation higher we’d like
 extend time moderates slowly modestly period, risks
 forecast still slightly upside. Even quite confident basic
 forecast view risks around it, couldn’t say actually know
 point much tightening need achieve target.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 130 177
 
 think it’s obvious move today. think need send signal
 want fed funds rate positive slope going forward. Achieving probability 50-50
 around move August would terrific, don’t know that. want
 much flexibility have. want market’s expectations policy responsive
 data going forward, sticky anticipation we’re going do; think,
 course, don’t want pre-commit. believe alternative B actually nice
 job achieving objective. it’s alternatives, think alternative B, like
 democracy, better alternatives. [Laughter]
 think face two types risk now. One risk, think Janet articulated best
 yesterday, may already midst prove acute adjustment
 housing much dramatic response households change expectations
 future income wealth saving rate unsustainably low rise
 significantly. plausible scenario going forward. second risk that,
 expectation stop 5.25, may left optimal path policy. want say
 two things emphasizing risk, even though don’t think judge predominant one.
 First, echo said yesterday, look back thought would end
 thought prevailing estimates neutral rate were, way market
 way under. Bluebook estimate now-prevailing equilibrium illustrates basic
 200 basis point move estimated equilibrium period, market’s expectations
 terminal rate moved lot. may loose long, may
 moves adjust effect stance inflationary behavior, inflation
 acceptance, psychology, momentum.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 131 177
 
 optimal control exercise—and thought memo gave us meeting
 helpful—left little troubled read exercises saying that,
 objective inflation really 1.5, we’re going tighter 5¼ percent;
 relax assumption around smoothing, get significantly higher near-term path fed
 funds rate judged optimal.
 even that, exercises imply view inflation persistence says we’re
 going 1.5 percent very, long time. situation, said, create
 risk people read persistence inflation implying higher inflation
 tolerance may make us vulnerable gradual erosion credibility.
 it’s possible we’re going need higher funds rate path assumed
 Greenbook, don’t know, don’t need make judgment today.
 want try cap expectations particular level hold down.
 things suggestions made. suggestions thoughtful,
 would oppose them. [Laughter] rise core inflation would unwelcome
 sustained represented expected path inflation significantly higher
 central forecast. say bulge like one we’ve seen today, given think driving
 it, unwelcome increases vulnerability perception we’re going little
 backward-looking. need flexibility stop point core inflation still
 accelerating, “unwelcome” would limit capacity that.
 think Governor Kroszner exactly right resisting suggestion characterize
 current stance policy somewhat restrictive. don’t know restrictive policy is;
 even did, business calibrating judgment statements
 restrictive are. important, statement says implicitly think, Bill, you’re
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 132 177
 
 trying achieve, convey see monetary policy getting traction
 economy today. also don’t need quite vivid saying expectation bring core
 inflation medium term implicit level. “Medium term” lot
 flexibility it, optimal control exercises suggest, don’t really know costs
 adopting specific horizon bringing inflation small
 deviation implicit target.
 think alternative B strikes good balance now, suggestion would alter
 balance way would good capturing consensus trajectory
 described yesterday. support moving 25 today language alternative B.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank much. Jeff.
 MR. LACKER. couple comments response things, that’s right,
 Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly.
 MR. LACKER. First, statement language we’ve using row 4 try
 influence probability we’d like see immediately statement next move
 conflated two things. combined assessment probability various data coming
 intentions we’re likely react data. result, data come in,
 short shelf life, far intermeeting period markets become
 uncertain haven’t told separately intentions are, guides
 respond data. That’s think alternative C, says something we’re
 about, going anchor inflation much better.
 President Stern, take comments mean favor something that’s synonymous
 “unwelcome” less coy, welcome suggestion.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 133 177
 
 haven’t really given Vincent’s simulations, inferences draw
 feasible paths inflation, lot discussion scrutiny. I’d interested know
 whether way evolution inflation expectations modeled simulations
 consistent possibility more-sudden faster changes expectations—as saw,
 example, middle 2003 seems taken place last two intermeeting
 periods, though small fluctuations. strikes leave entire simulation
 possibility communications influencing expectations rapid way.
 debate goes back three decades, don’t think we’re going settle today.
 reaction simulations certainly seems plausible could establish
 rapidly public’s mind intentions aim inflation 1½ percent. don’t think
 shy away attempting communicate way help process along.
 Stopping core inflation accelerating seems highly implausible. doubt
 would willing take risk market. That’s exactly problem ran late
 April JEC testimony: presence declining inflation, thing people singled
 statement remark may pause even inflation risks high
 side. statement probably call things question last two intermeeting
 periods anything else. So, again, think need focus way markets going
 interpret news coming way they’re going understand we’re going react. That’s
 I’ve harping intentions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. beat dead horse here, think sensitive

 there’s great deal uncertainty. don’t think extrapolate way particular
 piece information received remarked upon period discussion
 stand regard statement kinds things want talk about.
 Core inflation backward-looking number definition. times
 want move assessment forecast even core inflation rising,
 don’t think view decision less commitment inflation rather
 reasoned balancing two goals. Whatever happened JEC testimony
 indicative period we’re going less indicative think
 way communicate. We’ve got keep balance mind. don’t keep
 balance mind, believe subject overreaction, economy pays penalty that.
 don’t think insensitive that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, let thank much extremely
 helpful useful comments. I, too, think raise 25 basis points meeting.
 think it’s justified basic economic situation. greater risk seems inflation.
 think also, following things President Lacker said, credibility–psychology
 issue going here. Late April, perhaps testimony, small inflation
 scare. TIPS spread widened. commodity prices, metals prices, essentially went vertical
 while. minutes, remarks, remarks Presidents Governors succeeded
 bringing expectations significantly, even though two upside surprises CPI
 period. obviously connection exists talk market expectations.
 said that, think need say we’re going do.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 135 177
 
 Now, conditional know today, also add think we’re getting
 close need be. don’t know sure yet. Obviously look
 information, public utterances going forward somewhat balanced
 risks also somewhat uncertain we’re going future. riskmanagement calculations associated move quite difficult. President Poole
 mentioned risk inflation expectations get embedded higher level, would much
 expensive reduce later nip bud, speak, point.
 risk argues moving earlier rather waiting see happens. said, recognize
 also downside risks, potential nonlinearities housing markets
 financial markets. come think move try keep options
 open move slowly move further.
 respect statement, I’m first agree it’s work art.
 difficult balancing act here. First, achieved credibility gains past weeks.
 We’d like hold onto least much possible. However, want keep
 options open August, don’t want generate market fear completely
 focused inflation regard output, part mandate. It’s delicate
 balancing act show aware inflation situation
 single-mindedly focused inflation situation. statement designed show
 cognizant inflation risk. take note elevated readings. mention inflation
 risks remain. also note, however, output moderating give reasons that,
 say section 4 moderation output reduce pressure. Obviously
 there’s disagreement flat Phillips curve is, else equal,
 factor.
 
 June 28-29, 2006
 
 136 177
 
 Responding Governor Bies’ suggestion, think putting first sentence section 4
 rationale section 3 logical, way section 3 structured, first says, “Here
 things slowing inflation,” says, “But here’s we’re worried about.”
 put there, downgrade somehow; put section 4, say aware
 output risk. There’s also perhaps subtlety section 4 firming depend
 evolution outlook inflation economic growth. That’s actually adaptation
 suggestion President Minehan made, does, hope, indicate we’re looking
 variables make decision.
 I’m hopeful statement strike balance conveying vigilance,
 conveying concern, maintaining credibility gains, removing notions market
 certain move August pursue inflation single-mindedly
 rapid rate independent whatever happens real side economy.
 Again, respect suggestions made, think they’re
