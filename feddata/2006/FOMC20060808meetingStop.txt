 that’s lost me.
 However, question mind trend versus relative price effects here,
 think surely types effects. may wrong attribute pressure

 MR. WILCOX. I’ve chance take breath—another factor
 obviously critical behavior inflation expectations. know, Survey

 University Michigan survey—which show Greenbook table back 2004—was

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. President Poole asked significant part question, presented
 significant part question. [Laughter] let ask markup part this.
 know, always thought cushion compensation go higher,
 input costs go higher, profit margins shrink, therefore wouldn’t get

 factor going forward we’re looking forecasts, given we’ve seen unit labor

 MR. WILCOX. So, revised down. implication NIPA revision that,

 still noticeably historical averages. judgmental forecast, never
 placed enormous amount weight markup measures, perhaps chain
 events intermeeting period illustrates why. FRB/US model put lot

 First all, hard time getting markups enter reliably robustly

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you. question David Karen, picks
 President Poole’s. question what, anything, learn role
 energy-price increases factor raising core inflation experience
 countries. Since we’re country experiencing increases energy
 commodity prices, question whether econometric evidence
 pertains degree energy-price pass-through core inflation developed
 economies. I’m thinking particularly economies inflation expectations
 reasonably well anchored—for example, United Kingdom, Canada, euro area.
 know energy-price pass-through core inflation? evidence that?
 MS. JOHNSON. suspect is, confess I’m really able give
 details morning. attempted major project sort. two
 things immediately taken account you’re thinking kind
 cross-country, least non-U.S., look this. First tax features. Many
 industrial countries specific taxes, much higher specific taxes, fuel products one sort
 another, particularly gasoline also things. economies experience
 much smaller percentage change wholesale retail prices given change
 crude oil price will. shock always damped upside also
 downside, course. that’s factor point often, ocular regression

 Second exchange rate effect. dollar trending bit, short time
 anyway, needs taken care dynamics equation rather structure
 equation believe dollar oil price adjusts global demand supply.
 short episodes particular, one thought dollar experiencing spike
 that, obviously changes exchange value dollar look countries
 piece much oil prices gone them. general, many countries—say, Japan
 and, matter, even Europe—have sense overall effect less
 energy intensity less. constantly lecturing us consume much energy.
 Whether, ceteris paribus, actual parameter terms price shock really differs can’t tell
 you, specific taxes consequent reduction energy intensity helped
 produce, factors made less energy-intensive, make problem
 seem smaller industrial countries.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. David, opening comments said staff got last

 concerned about, like Sandy, speed consumers reacting

 start seeing increasing return, particularly skilled people, everybody tells

 MR. WILCOX. Let take concerns turn. First, regard speed

 ignorant ones little morality play; households businesses aware
 slower growth potential GDP; that, far households businesses concerned,

 example, leaving stock market projection unrevised. Implicit way

 looked surveys since last meeting, came couple conclusions. surveys
 ask questions “How doing?” “What personal financial condition?”
 numbers tend go rather positive direction. “I’m pretty well, great” answer,
 cut data. surveys ask questions “How neighbor

 Federal tax receipts, mention meetings, July showed year-over­
 year growth 13 percent. gains wages salaries implied increased tax
 collections finally make sense light recasting official data last
 week’s revisions, real wages salaries risen 3.4 percent past year,
 six-year high.
 Turning business sector, put probably confident around
 table state sector, though heard talk diminution “animal spirits.”
 look data, see that, discussed morning, ratio profits GDP
 record high. Momentum continues quite strong, credit spreads low, acceleration
 business sales, low ratios inventories sales; factors seem speak
 underlying strength.
 manufacturing sector, despite noisy data jobs employment, appears
 incredibly strong position. ISM manufacturing index, PMI, industrial production,
 advanced annual rate 6.6 percent second quarter,
 positive indicators manufacturing sector. also continue hear anecdotes
 see data real pricing power sector, good news growth front
 probably gives us couple questions inflation front.
 Finally, Dino referred outset bottom-up analyst estimates profits

 news boards directors companies, heard slowdown aren’t

 One area spoke earlier capital expenditure number second

 probably look number volatile transportation-related orders.
 Moreover, look second half year 2007, data unfilled orders
 appear positive. Pent-up demand cap-ex higher, given past three years
 growth rates 6.4 percent rather 8.3 percent earlier anticipated.
 thing would note cap-ex seems greater dispersion industry

 would probably describe many inflation expectations relatively calm;
 guess, I’d say they’re probably bit wobbly would like.
 bad news front, think President Fisher President Poole made
 reference this, matter slice core PCE data CPI data, even

 Again, question persistent trend is, genuine concerns front.
 inflation data likely deteriorate, obviously look broad range GDP outcomes
 balance 2006. particular, took note Greenbook’s simulation persistent
 inflation 3 percent core, would consider genuine risk, although Greenbook
 simulation suggests fed funds rate would need go 5.9 percent, I’m probably
 concerned might work series events came pass.
 Finally, let quickly note labor compensation front. believe many gains
 shown front quite surprising upside. good news
 workers past couple years, help explain conundrum, we’ve heard
 us sat table asked Capitol Hill: productivity
 remarkably high compensation remarkably low? gains trade capital
 labor changed? think data suggest haven’t. If, fact, see continued
 acceleration compensation gains—even, Greenbook suggests, 5½ percent—I suspect
 markets look take face value gains likely
 inflationary many us around table believe. think that’s another concern.
 balance, I’d summarize position considerably concerned

 I’d like talk important housing sector, terms expected level

 last meeting, GDP contribution estimated staff housing construction went

 Second, associated consideration lot uncertainty housing prices.

 MS. MINEHAN. It’s alternative C.
 MR. MADIGAN. alternative C, President Minehan mentions. think it’s simply
 question whether Committee prefers speak terms, whether would like

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. found challenging meeting arriving
 policy conclusion. certainly agree many inflation running higher
 want longer wanted, actively debated whether continue
 tightening path. end, think number advantages keeping policy
 unchanged careful talk upside risk inflation see. One
 advantages staff may actually right. [Laughter] Keeping policy rate may
 consistent moderation inflation coming quarters. Even inflation doesn’t moderate
 quite fast us might want to, least it’s right, downward, track.
 previous remarks cited things lead think that’s nontrivial possibility. One
 evidence growth slowing least growth rate potential
 maybe little below. Second, think influences we’ve seen inflation
 transitory, Governor Kroszner said, lessen time. think keeping policy
 rate could well consistent making progress toward objectives stable prices
 maximum employment time.
 there’s strong expectation market, 100 percent around 80 percent,
 won’t anything, think that, keep policy unchanged continue express
 considerable concern inflation risk, little market reaction terms
 expected interest rates curve. would imply financial conditions
 won’t loosened keeping policy unchanged. Talking inflation risks also
 preserve flexibility future. We’ll let market know we’re worried about,
 keeping policy unchanged talking inflation risks give us
 flexibility, would very, important given uncertainties. downside risks
 growth well risk inflation remain higher. Expressing concerns

 inflation keeping policy unchanged gets us Chairman Bernanke called “the escalator”

 stopping today.
 terms language statement, I’m sure alternative B fully expresses
 concerns heard around table inflation risk. President Moskow raised one
 issues—that alternative B language nothing high levels resource utilization. think
 high resource utilization risk. One suggestion would take language alternative C
 section 3 put alternative B perhaps better expression Committee’s
 concerns are, even keeping policy unchanged. would speak President Moskow’s
 point.
 Another word dropped announcement “productivity” damping
 inflation. think that’s close call well. Productivity growth remains strong. staff
 marked little expected path productivity, remains pretty high compared
 history. time, compensation increasing, labor costs really holding
 inflation aren’t expected hold future. could go either way terms
 including reference productivity. me, deleting would indicate unit labor cost
 path holding inflation, cited last time, isn’t anymore.
 fact productivity continues strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 think you, Ben, anticipated one earlier testimonies—perhaps first one

 other, I’m sort side line. margin favor increasing federal funds
 rate 25 basis points. believe inflation risks upside we’re risk current
 higher rates inflation become embedded business practices and, therefore, get reflected
 market expectations expectations measure. don’t think we’re way behind
 curve, think need ensure policy stays less rather accommodative.
 noted earlier, one looks real interest rates, among things, financial conditions
 rather less accommodative earlier summer, personally don’t think that’s
 consistent inflation risks face.

 Now, pointed market anticipating this. reason another,

 recognize surprising market increase would surprise, [laughter] I’m
 sure that’s bad thing, particularly concerned inflation around table

 recognize may minority here. would strongly advocate that,
 talk pausing, suggest markets think risks economy

 voting member, I’d vote raise fed funds rate 25 basis points use form
 alternative C, possibly adjusting last line indicate ongoing concern inflation
 probably going way direction alternative D. recognize that’s likely
 consensus here. would strongly favor alternative B terms language,
 change mentioned—taking section 3 moving alternative B—to perhaps give
 stronger cast overall assessment.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. favor alternative B. tough decision.
 personally consider wiser course action, although think there’s question case
 made raising rates today. Alternative B several advantages. First, pause
 meeting give us chance review incoming data next six weeks, isn’t

 think significant downside risk growth, mentioned, housing
 particularly acute example. think policies taking bite economic momentum,
 agree analysis Chairman gave least downside risk source.
 also disturbed trajectory core inflation first half year. We’ll see two
 CPI reports data next meeting, think maybe help us sort
 sustained rise inflation truly likely be.
 said, there’s doubt mind make good case raising rates today,
 frankly probably would ended favoring myself, despite associated risk
 growth, thought imminent danger losing inflation-fighting credibility
 markets general public. that’s case view. markets
 don’t expect us raise rates today. Yet inflation expectations contained. President Lacker
 emphasized, agree this, cannot take credibility granted. Economic models
 allow imperfect credibility show that, central bank lacks full credibility,
 respond somewhat aggressively inflation would optimal completely
 credible, President Lacker’s point. agree that. models don’t imply
 central bank act price stability sole objective. current context,
 suggests credibility likely preserved long continue respond
 economic conditions manner basically consistent pattern Committee

 think that’s we’ve essentially continue do.
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 86 158
 
 advantage alternative B, think important, suggest concern
 inflation risks. completely agree express concern. expect hope
 inflation going edge down, don’t great deal confidence forecast.
 would want see statement suggesting inflation risks balanced present time;
 think would misleading. statement should, effect, contain asymmetric bias toward
 tightening, that’s true whether actually raise rates don’t raise rates. would oppose
 alternatives C, objection substituting language alternative C
 B Governor Kohn suggested.
 find hard predict market reaction going be, language could end
 raising market’s expectations concerning future rates. would consider appropriate
 light fact standard policy rules optimal policies reported Bluebook suggest
 increases fed funds rate likely called coming months.
 communications consistent analysis indicate think we’re
 probably done.
 what’s advantage alternative B? get escalator 25 basis points per
 meeting, take pause, evaluate incoming data without saying think we’re done
 tightening phase. worry market psychology developed suggests minute
 stop raising rates we’re absolutely finished. contrast Greenbook’s trajectory,
 we’re going stay quickly reverse, markets apparently anticipate
 rather rapid policy reversal. Greenbook assumption sensible position—it would
 sensible set market expectations idea quick reversal. would
 unwelcome see market trajectory future bounce up.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Guynn.

 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. speaker, discussion gets
 interesting. think it’s fair say anybody involved
 policymaking process long made speech talked publicly come
 meeting views you’re always willing listen colleagues change
 mind. come probably close phenomenon today ten years
 table.
 listened discussion earlier, guess bit surprised great
 concern inflation is. share certainly great extent. think one could, fact,
 make strong case tightening move today. seems me, however,
 tightening move today would come expression continuing concern
 inflation. That, think, would imply probably additional tightening moves. combined
 notion we’re satisfied path we’re get inflation well within range,
 tightening move today implies even greater likelihood tightening. think kind
 path raises probability we’re going much stay long this. “me
 too” comments, perhaps come Southeast, housing
 important factor—though I’m sure understand completely slowdown housing
 important may turn be—it certainly factor mind. I’m willing give
 weight optimistic forecast inflation sounds though are. appreciate
 pricing power discussion we’ve heard around table, hearing years,
 would hope things kept playing would continue keeping
 playing out.
 Again, one could, fact, make honorable case tightening move today,
 that’s came in, that’s end discussion. think
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 88 158
 
 ways that’s harder conclusion come to, still favor something like alternative B. would
 good us demonstrate willingness pause try understand things
 going little better do. willing trust, perhaps are,
 forecast inflation going work way down. less obsessed trying push
 way 1½ percent short term. don’t think world would expect
 insist that.
 enough credibility use bit give time see
 are. forecast things going okay turns wrong, change
 position rather quickly regain whatever loss credibility somebody thinks may
 incurred. Again, things considered, favor change policy today language similar
 what’s alternative B. intend dissent today consensus side tightening,
 reasonably strong preference using opportunity take break path we’ve
 try understand bit better are. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Gee, say? [Laughter] It’s difficult call, indeed,
 consider really fortunate happen discussion first time. Maybe
 advantages disadvantages that. Maybe don’t carry baggage

 token, don’t think raising rates 25 basis points going significant effect real
 economy near term either, help reinforce public’s perception commitment
 price stability. believe Committee done outstanding job maintaining
 credibility thus far, evidenced fact we’ve noted longer-term inflationary
 expectations seem well anchored. longer-term expectations remain contained
 markets people expect FOMC contain actual inflation. Thus, careful

 subsequent meetings.
 Committee chooses raise rates, risk sending message
 willing tolerate inflation acceptable level significant period time? take
 Greenbook’s forecast point forecast, repeatedly said, basically say
 we’re prepared tolerate PCE core inflation excess 2 percent four years perhaps more.
 Sending message may generate increased uncertainty commitment low inflation;
 inflation expectations become unhinged result, would lead bad
 outcomes given costs imposed economy strive regain credibility. recognize
 rate increase may come surprise markets, I’m less sure that, slightly
 longer period, won’t indeed good news markets economy whole.
 Thus, see it, argument favoring another move today based comparison

 potential costs so, given inflation think it’s going.
 economy’s growth prospects deteriorate significantly coming weeks months, clearly
 opportunity pause even reduce rates think necessary.
 contrast, ask myself, “How difficult be, pause today, resume rate
 increases need so?” question leads thinking language statement.
 choose pause today, it’s important send clear strong signal
 statement language committed price stability. Pointing inflation pressures
 likely moderate time important believe case need
 explain why, despite inflation comfort zone, aren’t acting. Pointing
 inflation risks remain would help convey idea may need act future bring
 inflation forecasts turn wrong.
 I’d like close suggesting us needs ask following
 questions: information likely see next six weeks would cause us,
 pause today, initiate another rate increase September? might cause us cut rates
 September? event data real economy bit muddled,
 past six weeks, inflation continues unabated, find position
 inertia would lead us continue pausing would possibly put us behind

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. outlined earlier, sense that, largely eliminated

 circumstances like look back similar periods independent gauge

 One important difference late 1990s inflation better

 noted, inflation going opposite direction. Briefly, 2 percent since early

 level expectation measures contained reassuring.
 I’ll note TIPS inflation compensation figures taken last Friday afternoon

 let’s take 0.4, Bluebook’s adjustment. expected long-run inflation expectations
 accord opinion around table—that would like see inflation within
 comfort zone 1 2 percent—you’d expect core inflation 1.5 percent, you’d
 expect inflation expectation measures 1.9 percent. look survey evidence,
 2.5, 2.9, 3.2 percent. it’s clear inflation compensation inflation

 worse inflation outlook indicates that, anything, real short rate

 problem alternative B, worded, this: believe

 we’re going successful fighting inflation. Kevin Warsh said, markets
 pretty fickle. We’re going get bad news inflation coming months,
 hope markets maintain confidence Federal Reserve. confidence

 like Governor Kohn’s suggestion change alternative B. It’s important

 MR. KROSZNER. said before, obviously extremely difficult decision,
 agree many people around table said respectable arguments could

 unchanged communicating very, strongly wariness inflation.
 think value pausing see going happen growth. Around
 table, certainly expressed different views happening growth. know
 we’re likely continue getting somewhat unfavorable numbers inflation, think
 markets well primed that. We’ve gotten numbers worrisome
 unwelcome particularly favorable inflation, haven’t seen inflation expectations
 become unanchored. Also, we’ve seeing markets apparently assuming
 going move we’re going move future, look
 fed funds futures markets; assumption hasn’t manifested increase
 short-term longer-term inflation prospects.
 That’s heartening me. weren’t case, would feel comfortable
 moving toward supporting pause because, many us discussed, expectational
 context credibility important. Credibility easy thing lose difficult
 thing recapture, don’t think pause would lead us lose credibility. think
 also it’s important see pause next meeting possibly
 going multiple meetings lot information, particularly respect inflation,
 come time. expressed view may seeing transitory effects
 inflation due primarily shelter services. Within two three meetings we’ll
 better feeling whether effects likely transitory, think keeping
 powder dry valuable.

 We’ve emphasizing data dependent forecast

 forecast dependent helps underscore that, even though current data recent

 would favor going alternative B language alternative C. I’m sure
 alternative C language adds much more, given fairly strong statement

 alternative B, modified Don, best job communicating message.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank much. First all, I’d like thank
 everyone really helpful thoughtful discussion. useful. Let make
 comments.
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 109 158
 
 First, need careful think optimal policy looks like.
 doesn’t take form keep raising rates we’re happy inflation rate.
 Instead, need look rate that, maintained, ultimately give us good
 trajectory economy. would submit don’t really know yet.
 President Lacker made interesting arguments real rate interest
 late ’90s. good arguments, would reply him, first, we’ve seen
 low real rates past decade, global savings glut that, and, second,
 moment shock significant unknown size—the housing market,
 declining sharply. agree may well want go are. think
 that’s, fact, likely outcome. really can’t sure point
 ultimately want stop, need bit cautious try learn exactly
 level going be. reasons, I’m comfortable alternatives C
 basically say we’re done, either 5.25 5.50, choices
 alternative B alternative D.
 I’m concerned alternative because, besides raising rate 5.50, signals
 increases. seventeen consecutive moves, would tightening housing
 decline. don’t much confidence need strong point.
 Signaling strong concern inflation cautious groping optimal
 level interest rate probably wiser course. remind Fed
 terribly successful soft landings. chance get one. else equal, think
 would good could achieve that.
 I’d recommend alternative B. I’ll come back language moment.
 characterize hawkish pause. think several advantages: first gather
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 110 158
 
 information. respect points President Poole raised, think key
 information want look is, first, activity; want look employment, housing,
 consumption, particular, give us indications growth going forward.
 also want look inflation data inflation expectations data. Inflation expectations,
 specifically, mentioned statement, untethering inflation expectations would
 be, own, grounds us respond. risk falling behind curve pausing
 relatively small. Again, think we’re couple moves away
 optimal level. Therefore, miss meeting two move November
 December, still able reach optimal level within reasonable period time.
 Moreover, degree freedom end, speak. markets expect us
 begin cut, always maintain rate level longer period expected
 get restriction. substance think grounds, seventeen moves
 housing market indeterminate situation, pause get information.
 I’d like say word tactics well. President Minehan correct
 introduction idea pause particularly well received. now, least
 reading commentary, explained difference pause stop. It’s useful us
 get flexibility allow us necessarily move every meeting move
 data require. demonstration flexibility value terms creating
 optionality us future. Also, talking data dependence.
 creating flexibility, we’ll able increase relationship
 data say, think that’s already working. example, would note wide dispersion
 views among dealers we’re eventually going stop. dispersion
 views comes differences think economy inflation going.

 encouraging looking us forward guidance rather
 looking state economy trying judge Fed go achieve
 objectives. recognizing concerns raised taking seriously,
 think best option, perhaps many great options, hawkish pause,
 associate alternative B.
 respect language, think improvement take least first
 sentence section 3 alternative C, includes high resource utilization, use place
 first sentence section 3 alternative B. two questions group. One,
 want reintroduce go back old language including productivity gains? so,
 would require second sentence alternative A, section 3. not, use whole
 section 3 alternative C. That’s question one. Two, President Poole expressed concern
 housing reference. could simply say “reflecting lagged effects” leave
 housing part. would take suggestions that. would note used housing
 phrase past meetings, would change. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. unit labor cost figures suggest leaving productivity gains this.
 That’s opinion.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. comments? President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. keep productivity gains in, would suggest striking
 word “ongoing.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. others?
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. May say something mention housing?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly.
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 112 158
 
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. think Bill’s reservations right.
 course, would applied last time used it, too. guess would argue keeping
 housing grounds it’s happening. principal area see
 weakness going economy, make reference reality seems little
 awkward. would like statement didn’t mention what’s happening either
 energy prices housing, would hard justify. would keep it, simple
 grounds happening it’s accurate description reality. don’t think it’s
 problem.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Section 2 reasonably interpreted referring second-quarter
 GDP. That’s news have, slowing wide range sectors.
 think that’s sensible interpretation. continuing concerns housing going
 forward. understand that. seems section 2 really statement
 already happened economy—that’s essential element it—and housing
 biggest thing happened. would also agree Jeff keep productivity
 people logically say, “Well, unit labor costs really important here,”
 don’t great story tell unit labor costs.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. think would odd take reference housing, given
 mentioned number times past. rationale clearly says it’s
 “partly reflecting” gives number factors. saying factors
 ones. Also, don’t interpret language simply happened past;
 “has moderated” also talking are—that growth strong was. see

 MR. PLOSSER. I’m new language nuances housing. occurs me,
 however, one question ought ask whether including housing continuing
 include housing Committee putting position can’t raise rates
 housing comes back. unfairly locking in, least markets going

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. think President Plosser good point President
 Poole well. Section 2 aimed explaining happened growth past.
 Everything moderated. me, surprising thing slow business fixed
 investment was. surprising housing slow expected housing
 slow, think could easily take housing there. lagged effects

 think Charlie good point. don’t want hang action one piece data
 
 August 8, 2006

 versus another piece data going forward. I’m agnostic productivity, tell truth.
 think unit labor cost numbers good news—we problems there—and
 hang saving factor may want do.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. think need come resolution. Oh, sorry.
 Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. would prefer leave housing housing resources aren’t readily
 substitutable parts economy. leave resource utilization in, we’re sort
 acknowledging that, although housing soft, still resource pressures parts
 economy. think picture better balanced way.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. Let say think
 language purely descriptive. don’t think it’s conditioning action anything
 housing. don’t think market tie move housing. Let’s take straw
 vote. many would like keep statement housing included? One, two,
 three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Okay. think that’s majority. we’ll
 leave section 2 is. sentiment going back alternative A, section 3, second
 sentence, includes ongoing productivity gains? favor that?
 [Laughter] right. statement, then, exactly alternative B, except third

 Finally, subject individuals versus committee—I don’t think Committee
 constrain individuals. That’s committee process about—that ought feel
 free express opinions well outside Committee. However, also think that,
 times, circumstances number us speaking around time,
 creates impression committing Committee. would want us think hard

 committing Committee saying views Committee’s views,

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll comment three areas,
 spirit general here. First, goals—I thought goals put
 document distributed good. well stated appropriate
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 122 158
 
 balance. didn’t think constrain open discussion meetings. communication
 uncertainty conditionality difficult, part goal better.
 Second, quantity information forward-looking content—that whole
 series questions asked—I’d divide comments two parts. One, go
 type quantitative guideline, need release information. We’d need
 something like inflation report, maybe quarterly, central banks have,
 explain elaborate guideline economy versus quantitative
 guideline. don’t think could stay twice-a-year report give
 detail.
 Third, talk longer-term forecasts now. That’s important
 part this. fact, Committee decides go quantitative guidelines, could
 accomplish many objectives longer-term forecasts economy.
 longer-term forecasts, we’d address many issues discussed
 sections here—the policy assumption question, example. based
 appropriate policy, could different ways. longer forecasts would allow
 us convey policy goals, discuss expected paths achieving goals, take
 account range opinions regarding paths goals without necessarily us agree
 quantitative guideline. point, I’m agnostic question whether
 quantitative guideline. say really haven’t decided yet topic
 discussion. case, longer-term forecasts would one option consider
 go quantitative guideline. course, go quantitative guideline,
 could also longer-term forecasts. think longer-term forecasts would help us
 improve formulation monetary policy, either without quantitative guideline.

 technical part this.
 We’re good start, particularly like goals set forth.

 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let make comments. I, too, like
 goals. me, overarching objective communication policy enhance

 think I’ll stop there.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. think Committee made huge strides
 past decade toward greater transparency more-effective communication, example
 that—it 1994, guess—we actually started issuing post-meeting statements. think
 we’ve seen significant dividends innovations. advanced goals
 policy effectiveness accountability. communication strategy point, view,
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 125 158
 
 fundamentally broken, hope accomplish coming months
 produce improvements current practice without going wholesale changes.
 thought today would touch couple points I’ve thinking
 relating communications, without getting specifics. Frankly, think goals fairly
 noncontroversial. regard pretty much motherhood apple pie issues. What’s
 challenging figuring exactly use communications better internally
 Committee externally serve policy goals.
 couple cautionary notes: First, want endorse point made
 put list goals objective maximize transparency sake
 greater transparency. research area provides ambiguous advice much
 transparency optimal. Second, need careful communications don’t actually
 impede process making appropriate policy decisions ability so. contrast
 you, generally favored inclusion forward-looking language post-meeting
 statements, least Committee reasonably clear idea policy going,
 quite recently. including guidance potential building false
 expectations constrain actions. hope continue provide forwardlooking guidance public think enhance effectiveness policy
 actions. think need clear kinds policy pronouncements
 unconditional commitments future actions, need continue emphasize data

 want also emphasize point Cathy made, communication

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. first set questions

 form expectations regarding future policy actions reasonable goal communication
 policy. second goal seems clear, too—ensuring accountability people
 granted us monopoly policy actions.
 It’s important clear what’s meant communication regarding future policy
 actions. may mean saying something future path interest rates—and we’ve done
 several times—but doesn’t to. alternative approach articulate
 objectives determine interest rate choices future, principle, someone
 understands objectives constraints we’re able figure we’ll
 choose given circumstance. think offers really good prospects overcoming
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 129 158
 
 problems Committee encountered forward-looking guidance
 language, essentially tell public interest rate settings think likely
 required achieve objectives. seems though communicating would enhanced
 telling objectives are. sense, would aid efficiency.
 subcommittee asked constraints affect communications. obvious one
 comes mind time consistency—essentially, idea claims future
 actions credible. People think future selves, us successors,
 actually want follow actions we’ve implied communications—
 selecting future selves going select. question whether
 communications constrain future selves immediately arises. Now, one make
 stark assumptions question. literature, typically see two polar cases
 analyzed: One “yes, totally”—the perfect commitment case; “no, all”—the
 complete discretion case. purposes discussion, think makes sense adopt
 intermediate view future selves likely view costly perceived
 taking actions contradict previously communicated. I’m happy assume
 statements cheap talk, use game theory language. time, don’t
 think credibility communications perfect costless. junctures need
 think whether want follow we’re implying
 communications.
 idea related separate issue often arises discussions inflation
 targeting communications, whether communication reduce future
 flexibility. point, let say stabilize value money already
 sacrificed great deal flexibility. I’d claim we’ve given flexibility inflate
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 130 158
 
 deflate 10 percent given year, near future. We’ve given lot things
 convince people money value now. really isn’t question
 giving flexibility; it’s question flexibility want give up. I’d make
 another point well. communication going value all, it’s going persuade
 people change minds actions would take future. Well,
 that’s true, sense involve giving flexibility
 public perceived us have. flexibilities would like preserve,
 flexibilities we’d like give up. don’t think flexibility per se trump card
 situation.
 subcommittee asked information communicated. I’ll focus
 one thing talked earlier today, that’s long-run inflation objective. Let
 precise mean here. Averaging across possible futures, taking account
 expected react possible future, inflation rate n periods

 account we’re going react? Let define average long-run expected

 models (except learning policymaker occurring)—models
 Taylor rules fixed reaction function plopped in—if take n long
 enough, like five years so, long-run expected inflation single number never varies.

 Whenever encounter one software programs calculating retirement

 think it’s real tragedy don’t anything tell country circumstances
 like that. It’s one thing ought able pin long run; it’s one
 thing know deliver. can’t deliver predicted average real growth rate; know
 can’t deliver predicted average unemployment rate; agree fair amount

 subject.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Guynn.
 MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, since I’m going October, probably
 sit quietly; can’t resist. think almost everything said. want
 comment quickly couple things. I’m sure really talked fundamental
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 132 158
 
 question—that is, trying communicate with. deserves bit discussion,
 seems me.
 Building whole notion trying quantify objectives, think we’ve seen
 box get in. absence something, start offering
 quantitative whatever. current time, we’re position many us
 specified think comfort zone is. haven’t explained we’re going measure
 it; haven’t reconciled differences across people; haven’t explained we’re going
 we’re there; we’ve gotten kind halfway house. Whether
 we’d like talk inflation targeting things go not, we’re going
 stop deal it.
 haven’t really talked much role forecasts—and hope
 policymaking always based forecasts—but much explicit
 role recent times. opens whole question whose forecast talk
 forecasts different stages.
 Finally—and can’t resist commenting—I think greatest short-term tension regards
 issue four-paragraph post-meeting statement
 minutes. I’ve come view Bill Poole less more. simply can’t
 get much different ways thinking four-paragraph statement. think that’s
 impossible task. think differently. We’ve heard today. statement
 simplistic. would hope get around talking issue would clear
 minutes offer much better way trying help people understand
 uncertainty range views go policymaking let little simplistic
 statement meeting become important communication. End story. Thank you.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Let concentrate forward-looking information federal funds
 path something associated it. One problems Janet’s position that, every
 time put information in, need exit strategy we’re going get out.
 soon stop putting in, get tangled up. fact, think that’s
 today one reasons language statement today. would
 put special circumstances clear understanding strategy

 argument whole bias/tilt language goes back Volcker, believe; used
 device try produce agreement within Committee. continued
 Greenspan. wasn’t announced public. idea would get people
 go along Chairman wanted saying we’ll tilt toward X Y,
 down; meant produce larger vote consensus. started announce
 publicly, started affect markets. part decision. favor time,
 since strong second thoughts it—in part experience
 trying get started road.
 need put thought explaining statement decision reached,
 don’t much really. don’t put much text around reason decision,
 compared risks foreshadowing might future. that’s
 would put effort drafting statement.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree goals listed
 subcommittee’s memo right goals. However, thinking next questions
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 134 158
 
 concerning quantity content information nature forward-looking
 information provide, find difficult make judgments without knowing we’re
 going emerge discussion policy approach take, especially discussion
 whether we’re going adopt numerical inflation objective. others said, think
 communication practices need reinforce policy strategy. fact, consider
 communication practices part policy strategy.
 So, example, move path adopting numerical objective inflation,
 appropriate communication strategy may simply provide explicit inflation
 objective little guidance specific policy moves beyond reference performance
 objective. case, think would less need information statement
 follows meeting. However, might require information semiannual report
 Congress.
 regarding forward-looking language, think depends whether
 adopt numerical objective inflation. successful communication strategy first
 foremost give public confidence we’re going produce low inflation long run.
 don’t think good communication policy strategy, others already said, necessarily
 means make sure public anticipate next policy move.
 numerical objective helping us anchor long-term inflation expectations, forward-looking
 guidance might reserved times Committee great deal certainty
 course near-term policy moves perceives cost misunderstood
 exceptionally great.
 Regarding last set questions subcommittee involving individual
 communications Committee communications, believe whatever communication
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 135 158
 
 strategy adopt, important preserve ability give express independent views,
 especially forecasts, policy strategies, actions, forth. It’s clear us
 formulates independent opinions policy actions, form opinions
 sense think economic conditions evolve. I’d like preserve ability
 enjoy today sharing independent thinking climate sense today
 Committee that’s skilled building consensus around different perspectives yet sees
 benefit respectful dissent. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Well, Mr. Chairman, responsibility fiat currency,
 straightforward undiplomatic way describing living
 performing great confidence game. think that’s important bear mind. President Yellen
 said, apple pie motherhood. answer “yes” first questions,
 questions agents talking and, talk generating wellinformed expectations, so.
 mentioned earlier, Governor Kohn’s embarrassment, “full frontal exposure,” think
 that’s unimportant point. maintain confidence game maintain and—if
 you’ll permit say experienced side—to maintain last bastion
 integrity Washington—and feel strongly that—we careful
 preserve bit modesty mystery accomplish goals. really tough part far
 go, that’s we’re going talk going path. example, I’m
 somewhat uncomfortable, even though great respect President Moskow, making
 long-term forecasts. forecast, probable error is. wary
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 136 158
 
 exposing vulnerabilities, think mindful go time. That’s
 one thought.
 Another thought statement. may forgotten logic here, think
 straight Occam’s razor—that is, take variables possible
 explain decide do. think minutes important illumination. don’t
 want manipulate minutes, think use quite effectively. statement
 earlier meeting, discussing view economy, said think
 effectively last time around.
 third point—I’m strong believer partnerships. mentioned dinner
 Presidents last night. I’m also strong believer strong managing-partner model,
 worked life private sector partnerships. think it’s very,
 important diversity views, second said table front
 well. three comments, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support broad goals laid here.
 thinking communication, see one challenge relates
 dialogue today. set long-term goals. link
 individual meeting actions decisions? already talked inflation
 2 percent top goal two years, likely two years more. would
 explain trying go forward? sort problem corporations
 every year, set goals shareholder returns, earnings jump around like
 crazy quarter quarter. Well, we’re going kind issue. raises question
 whether want talk we’re going get one place another. words,
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 137 158
 
 company say took big chargeoffs, reduce cost base,
 making acquisition. need real dialogue set goal going
 mean short-run communications meeting policy path. It’s
 difference setting goal implementing executing effectively. can’t
 communicate intend implement effectively, ought second thoughts
 goals we’re setting. Since I’ve really haven’t talked lot tie
 two together.
 forward-looking information—it might appropriate back started
 25 basis point step-up meeting. I’m glad we’re taking position we’re trying
 push risk back market. market make forecast what’s likely
 happen. need clear key drivers pick vital elements
 really agree on. need communicate well make market judge
 variables likely go outlook. don’t think service market
 feel sit back let us make call. moral hazard issues
 simply great.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. brief comments. First, respect
 concision statement minutes, guess perfect world minutes would
 come much sooner statement, recognize work needs get done get
 consensus understanding those.
 modest suggestion, take back October. minutes could end
 released somewhat sooner also corporate nature. strikes lot
 communication minutes useful history understanding
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 138 158
 
 many nuances we’ve talked probably useful
 communication purposes discussed here. would certainly useful crucial arguments
 discussion today available minutes three weeks elapsed.
 would take burden figuring goes statement. Without burdening
 staff getting product done sooner, could think rather part
 corporate-style set minutes. We’ve taught market full set minutes would come
 out, suggestion full set could somewhat delayed. That’s sort
 provocative suggestion without much discussion thought we’d want, think partly
 addresses statement issue.
 Second, striking right balance individuals Committee, I’m
 convinced ever, gone four FOMC meetings, diverse views
 people express monetary policy outside meeting important critically independent.
 I’m going say attempt break divergence views dissuade people
 sharing them. think it’s actually problematic FOMC participants say similar things
 meetings. example, Mr. Chairman, let’s say said X 18 us went
 repeated X less identically meeting. market understanding
 longer X 2X perhaps 10X 12X, think prove problematic. burden
 us, take messages different places meetings, thinking
 consequences, particular, we’re saying similar things. None means say
 believe instead X able go scream hills;
 believe nuance X, really consider markets going understand
 repetition they’ve heard.
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 139 158
 
 Third, brief point market discipline—I think President Yellen President
 Minehan made reference this. We’ve fairly cognizant past several meetings
 getting markets work rely us. market discipline
 important. Governor Kohn said outset purpose discussion
 transparency transparency’s sake try get right monetary policy objectives.
 strikes though could well test limits transparency sharing much information
 getting markets position stop much homework we’ve
 started getting point. right place come judgment somewhere
 around transparency ends making lemmings we’d ideally like. must
 admit I’m exactly sure pull off, strikes that’s way structure
 think discussion. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. goals pretty clearly stated,
 real problems them. agree communication transparency really key part
 maintaining enhancing credibility. also understand, listen people around
 table conversations, issues easy clear answers them,
 note advance views evolving think understand nuances
 issues. agree President Yellen. I’d like applaud Committee past
 ten years really great strides transparency communication.
 Part challenge, seems me, meet goals. think it’s true
 putting limits information released probably necessary certain periods
 time. example, wouldn’t advocate opening FOMC meetings public; think
 would terribly useful. hand, Governor Warsh talking perhaps
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 140 158
 
 releasing minutes earlier faster version them, maybe incomplete detail,
 including tone nature discussion. think could fairly useful informative,
 particularly noted disagreements discussions terms tension happened
 within meeting. spent several months Bank England couple years ago
 watched give take among committee members MPC also watched go
 public discuss different views disagreed other.
 instructive without apparently adding volatility marketplace.
 market come accept notion people disagreed things.
 information released might differ depending type monetary regime think
 we’re in—whether regime inflation targeting one full discretion. However, regardless
 regime, need policymakers clearly communicate goals are,
 understanding economy’s current economic conditions expected future conditions,
 reasons decisions important part communication.
 quantity information, quantity quality intertwined, I’m going
 talk together. Again, applaud expedited release minutes. Instituting
 tremendous step forward, think it’s good idea. However, would favor
 Committee’s releasing additional pieces information. obviously favor stating explicit
 definition price stability would help clarify goals. current practice
 citing range central tendency members’ forecasts fine, would favor releasing
 information, perhaps quarterly forecast something like inflation report, help
 convey marketplace public range views Committee
 stands state economy.
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 141 158
 
 might help public’s assessment views based forecasts
 underlying policy assumptions rather one might call appropriate policy, might
 differ member member obviously would likely well understood public
 anyway. One suggestion already mentioned conditioning forecasts
 market’s expected funds rate path, example. way stating assumptions
 projections potential GDP would important well information, again,
 help markets market participants understand Committee coming from.
 regard forward-looking information, think number things
 FOMC could communicate, current expectation future path fed
 funds rate one them. don’t think that’s good practice general. However,
 think need talk goals are, forecasts
 goals are, even qualitative sense process think we’re going get
 there. say, talking monetary policy respond various events—I hesitate
 use phrase “decision rule”—wouldn’t necessarily say anything future path fed
 funds rate, would informative.
 It’s critical, already mentioned, FOMC members agree
 goals are. members don’t need agree model economy channel
 think monetary policy actually operates. Indeed, given state economic science,
 differences models channels aid policy formation. Similarly, since dissents
 meeting public, dissenters feel free explain reasons dissent. shouldn’t
 discourage presidents members expressing views state
 economy process. Committee members free indicate views
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 142 158
 
 economy evolving. fact, think supports goal helping public form
 sound expectations policy actually going be.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you. want start saying think we’re
 confronted set issues really aren’t principally communication transparency.
 think they’re fundamentally conduct monetary policy monetary policy
 regime we’re going operate under.
 want say little see hierarchy challenges decisions
 make context. discussion objectives, particularly terms
 inflation, guide Committee’s decisions going forward, think it’s hard
 without discussion quantitative terms. also need get position thinking
 talking directly candidly meetings make decisions
 appropriate path inflation output, especially times we’re way basic
 objectives. don’t really now. We’ve living lot ambiguity whether
 we’re operating with, effect, objective getting core PCE particular level
 certain time not, don’t think comfortable living degree ambiguity
 much longer. ways, set issues first confront. may get
 consensus resolution, talk issues.
 also decide want disclose terms objectives, forecast,
 policy consistent forecast, uncertainty. face lot choices terms
 regarding quantitative versus qualitative explicit versus implicit
 approaches communications. Several said statements simply say
 decided why, don’t think it’s quite simple. “why” lot
 
 August 8, 2006
 
 143 158
 
 forecast, say nothing forecast statement would communicating little
 reasons policy decisions. “what” also simple: certainly
 principally whether move fed funds rate. “what” we’re deciding
 lot whether take view try change validate market expectations going
 forward period. don’t think get choices communication
 transparency agreeing want limit more-minimalist objectives
 communicating why. feels little complicated that.
 third point general point. going change regime, can’t
 piecemeal. can’t decide want announce quantitative definition long-term price
 stability without confronting kind disclosure regime adopt support that.
 Also, can’t think sensibly evolution disclosure regime around forecast,
 example, without coming greater understanding whether disclose quantitative
 objective inflation. think need viewed package. similar reason, think
 can’t approach set changes saying let’s move things easy less
 contentious consensus without better sense really want
 go. doesn’t mean change or, decide change things,
 together. still decide graduated approach introducing changes
 regime, make incremental move, need better sense
 want ultimately go. don’t consensus want go, it’s harder
