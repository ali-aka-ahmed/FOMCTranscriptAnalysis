 MR. KOS. haven’t made precise comparison, general would say

 before. articulated Desk overnight rate, whether period

 MR. LACKER. Well, carry adjustment doesn’t affect October ’06 calendar-year

 MR. REINHART. forward rate, yes.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. questions? Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. go back GSEs’ use early return? said they’re
 using term fed funds overnight. using overnight early returns?
 MR. KOS. That’s great question. It’s clear. seems wide range

 early. think one thing need understand better one thing we’ll
 looking coming months. It’s good question. wish good answer you.
 MS. BIES. Well, I’m glad you’re gathering data.
 MR. LACKER. May follow up? Compared early return, regular fed
 funds loan 24-hour loan plus option extend hours. It’s option—you
 could use not, right? point view, wanted get bead
 risk-free 24-hour rate, looks though early return might one we’d want
 target rather other—assuming market liquid enough that.
 MR. KOS. Well, early return returned early morning. Also, know
 anecdotally, data seem support it, trading takes place roughly 24
 hours delivery. that’s characterization small segment market.
 true 24-hour market, would presume 10:00 a.m. trades returned
 10:00 a.m. next day 11:00 a.m. trades 11:00 a.m. next day. That’s level
 exactness I’m sure replicated—or monitored, matter.

 important question. Karen, noticed last week International Monetary

 MS. JOHNSON. Part difference weighting use. First, number

 [Laughter] Second, use weights based U.S. export behavior. We’re trying construct

 Nonetheless, real country-by-country difference low side

 United States isn’t total foreign number. going put mentally

 Greenbook forecast, residential investment, though weak, supported continued growth

 Outside housing, however, recent developments help sustain continued

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. want start remarks today reflecting
 results latest Duke University CFO survey. survey six seven
 years old, one concluded September 10 CFOs’ optimism
 lowest levels five years, it’s continuing show erosion confidence. found
 
 September 20, 2006

 CFOs’ number 1 worry—weak consumer demand—interesting wasn’t
 before, uncertainty part CFOs worrying about. second biggest
 concern rising labor costs, attribute primarily scarcity labor.
 anticipating scarcity going continue drive labor costs higher. terms
 hiring plans, planning hire fewer people hired last quarter.
 expecting increase employment next twelve months 0.8 percent; last quarter’s survey
 showed 1.3 percent, that’s quite slowdown. However, they’re going increase outsourced

 adjustable labor force get flexibility uncertainty. also trimming
 capital spending plans next twelve months 5.1 percent, compared 7.5
 percent last quarter. Thus survey indicates CFOs growing concern; still
 optimistic overall, think caution there.
 Now, looking numbers myself, I’m perhaps quite pessimistic. Again,
 several said—and Dave commented remarks—except housing,

 know supervisory staff focusing that, too.
 People focusing fact delinquency rates mortgages still look good.
 However, we’ve seen rapid increase debt service ratios since 2004. I’m concerned,
 again, amount adjustable-rate mortgages reprice months

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like make four points, couple
 stated colleagues morning, spend little time
 them. First, like many you, concerned upside risks inflation
 downside risks output employment. Second, markets responded quite positively
 last FOMC, they’ve going right direction. stock market up, bond
 market up, energy commodities down, TIPS inflation compensation
 measures down. Six months ago would taken comfort that; now, six
 months central banker, I’m worried. [Laughter] join ranks Jack
 rest bit longer have. Third, first time since I’ve
 here, I’m little less sanguine supply side economy looking business
 base, cap-ex base, manufacturing base. find today probably
 comfortable, least comfortable I’ve been, strength resilience consumer
 demand. fourth point would like spend couple minutes think
 beginning major test market liquidity that’s happening real time fixed-income
 markets. let take turn.
 First, consumer side, consumer spending appears strong resilient.
 noted outset, strong July PCE reading, par strongest gains
 
 September 20, 2006
 
 77 132
 
 year, suggesting consumer demand may actually accelerating second
 quarter third quarter. Greenbook estimate 3 percent PCE third quarter
 2.75 percent PCE fourth quarter may actually understating strength
 consumer, particularly falling gas prices.
 I’m also comforted income growth labor market conditions, see likely
 far important consumer spending housing wealth. Consumer income gains
 appear rising. I’ve made note previously strong tax receipts. Although they’ve
 tapered somewhat, continue robust. Tax receipts year
 12.4 percent. past couple months would suggest high single digits,
 though noise data, take comfort them. recent
 corroboration labor income, revised NIPA data measures, suggests real
 wage salary income may accelerating. noted morning stock
 options bonus payments may effect first quarter, creating bit noise
 data. However, also remind us wealth effect equity gains, may
 partially offset negative wealth effect housing, particularly 100 million members
 investor class. think that’s something needs considered thinking
 strength consumer forecast period. Finally, think Governor Bies noted,
 labor markets remain reasonably tight. Despite softness housing, unemployment
 insurance claims unemployment rates remain quite encouraging.
 Turning moment business, perhaps little less optimistic
 I’ve before, industrial production still reasonably strong but, perhaps disappointingly,
 flattened August, even though July numbers appeared upward trend.
 looked back past 24 monthly readings 2004 2005, IP retail sales,
 
 September 20, 2006
 
 78 132
 
 found declined six times, I’m sure we’re seeing new trend here.
 sense IP September it’s remarkably strong, but, again,
 caution didn’t before. One note—unlike Greenbook, sense exports
 likely make real, meaningful contribution GDP forecast period.
 terms capital expenditure growth rates, another survey I’d like mention
 Business Roundtable survey came couple days ago. negative capital
 expenditures ever been. would say group mixed record calling
 inflection points, survey results, nonetheless, suggest little less 40 percent
 expect increased cap-ex next six months, whereas half said cap-ex would remain
 constant period. Perhaps that’s effort protect margins higher costs could
 partially passed through. I’ve noted before, earnings growth continues meet
 beat expectations, certainly second third quarters, sense
 fourth-quarter earnings also fine, probably still double-digit rates 10
 11 percent. Perhaps explains taking foot accelerator terms
 capital expenditures.
 terms housing, add bit previous discussion, sense
 residential sector may have, fact, crowded nonresidential loans
 recent boom nonresidential construction marked sharply second quarter,
 annual growth rate 22 percent. sense also market’s capital allocation
 function working well. C&I loans growing 15 percent more, perhaps highest
 rate past 20 25 years, we’ll probably see little capital allocation
 nonresidential sector. Whereas Greenbook assumes significant deceleration group,

 Turning inflation, think inflation risks materially receded, though we’ve
 probably seen acceleration stopping. is, we’ve seen top, new direction

 Let first talk growth go C plus plus G plus net exports.

 Also, briefly mentioned, see little government stimulus side. Tax revenues,
 Governor Warsh mentioned, high. Spending kept relatively tight.

 However, say that, although we’ve seen inflation expectations well

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let summarize quickly heard
 around table, I’d like make additional comments
 economy. sense that, real side, there’s two-tier economy. There’s housing
 sector maybe autos, there’s everything else. housing, there’s agreement
 significant correction occurring, views risks vary among participants.
 particular, feel still could quite deep correction, others say

 Greenbook later year 2007. particular, people noted higher incomes
 stock prices lower oil prices, support consumption growth business
 activity. least now, heard participants particularly concerned
 possible knock-on effects housing consumption investment. labor market remains

 go, reflecting part incomplete knowledge determinants inflation also
 mixed anecdotal evidence. However, hear clearly definite unhappiness
 level core inflation amount time projected return level less
 2 percent. principal concern credibility damaged inflation remains
 high long. would summarize discussion—I hope reasonably accurately—by
 saying inflation remains predominant risk still quite bit uncertainty
 evolution economy next quarters.
 Let add comments this—first inflation real
 economy. believe intermeeting news inflation good bad,
 particularly relative fact inflation lagging indicator would
 incredibly surprising gotten 0.3 readings past two months. I’ll talk first
 positive news, I’ll address risks going forward.
 First, evidence momentum inflation reversed. gave
 speech June 5, many followed on, emphasized three- six-month
 rates inflation indicating acceleration, rising inflation pattern, occurring.
 appears three-month rate inflation peaked May. So, example, May,
 core PCE 3.06 three-month basis; July, 2.24. market-based core PCE
 3.00 May, July 2.11. core CPI high 3.79 May, last
 reading August, 2.95. sense direction turned, momentum
 broken, think reflected views marketplace.
 Now, hasn’t much discussion details inflation report, think
 it’s actually quite significant. particular, important factor level
 change inflation owners’ equivalent rent (OER); we’ve discussed issue before. OER
 
 September 20, 2006
 
 88 132
 
 41 percent core CPI 19 percent core PCE. Although OER decelerating
 recently, it’s still three-month rate 4.4 percent, relative annual rate 2.66 percent
 2005. difference accounts great deal change today
 three-month basis versus 2005. good news OER
 measures rent shelter coming quickly many outside economists
 expected line staff less expected; indeed, number 3 percent
 August. stayed came bit more, would see better short-term
 numbers inflation going forward.
 positive news inflation obviously includes energy commodity prices.
 energy dominant factors supply-side factors control—hurricanes
 lack thereof geopolitical factors. it’s also interesting metals
 commodities peaks. suggests that, least margin, prospect
 slowing economic activity rising interest rates around world may taken bit
 pressure commodity prices. also indication since last meeting
 economy slower thought. Clearly, news autos housing
 negative direction, granting flatness Phillips curve, else equal,
 take pressure utilization pricing power. Finally, would argue expectations
 are, fact, really quite well contained. Around table, we’re getting used talking
 core inflation. inflation people see, course, headline inflation, ultimately
 target well. past year two, headline inflation gone well
 would consider reasonable levels, yet TIPS indicators, survey indicators,
 outside forecasters markedly changed long-term inflation forecast. take

 credibility issue seriously, don’t think much evidence yet
 credibility seriously impaired.
 negative side, main piece news higher compensation first
 second quarters. yet much evidence labor costs affecting inflation. We’ve
 already discussed issues measurement compensation per hour. Let note
 that, look components inflation moved most, get things like
 rent, airfares, used cars, things sort. don’t see much movement services,
 example, labor intensive. don’t think labor costs yet infected
 inflation rate; indeed, know there’s weak correlation labor cost measures
 inflation. However, let clear this, think key risk inflation
 forecast markets tighter, labor markets tighter, wages grow
 quickly, produce inflation would like. would summarize
 inflation situation modest improvement, encouragement, certainly
 agree general sentiment around table level core inflation certainly
 high.
 real side, paused last meeting observe lagged effects real
 activity previous interest rate moves. evidence suggests that, indeed, interestsensitive sectors worsen intermeeting period. saw second significant

 point, agree economy except housing reasonably strong factors
 supporting consumption particularly, going forward.
 look forward, think two issues. first severe
 contraction housing be. honest, don’t really know. We’re talking, again,
 
 September 20, 2006

 asset price correction, it’s difficult, principle, know far adjust.
 second issue much spillover housing correction rest
 economy. don’t quite much confidence people around table
 spillover effect. spillover effect would lagged effect, remains seen
 much effect might be. agree economy except housing autos
 still pretty strong, yet see significant spillover housing.
 Please look figure distributed.2 want talk bit risks
 directions think policy. Let describe two panels draw
 conclusion them. top panel shows four-quarter difference unemployment
 rate—that is, unemployment rate fourth quarter year minus unemployment
 rate fourth quarter last year, going back 1950. blue bars show recession
 periods. dashed line zero, solid horizontal line 0.3 percentage point.
 see that, without exception, every time since 1950 unemployment rate risen
 much 0.3 percentage point year, continued rise, we’ve seen recession.
 suggests unemployment rise tenths keeping quite
 easy linear models might suggest. bottom panel, see four-quarter changes

 However, would like put table suggestion change. alternative B,
 section 3, added phrase “on balance” first sentence: “Readings core inflation

 reasonable because, Chairman said, data inflation since last meeting probably

 three-month measures inflation peaked earlier. bit concerned that, small
 amount data seen recently, saying “on balance” making qualification
 balance concerned elevated levels. think also
