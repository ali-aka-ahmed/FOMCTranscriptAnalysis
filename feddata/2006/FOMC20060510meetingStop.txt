 times, awoken fear recent developments could provoke us
 familiar trap overshooting policy. policy lean strength

 continued accumulate housing markets softening, last Friday’s employment

 lightly risk overshooting mark.
 I’m embarrassed admit I’ve harbored fears—that falling behind

 almost certainly somewhat behind somewhat ahead curve,

 inflation concerns? little doubt price pressures

 Another troubling development inflation picture increase
 measures inflation compensation inflation expectations. TIPS measures inflation

 price data themselves? core consumer price index (CPI)

 Finally, concern could process overshooting mark

 So, end, could see heap worries variety different directions,

 David would happy answer questions.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Questions colleagues? President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. David, noted alternative scenario Greenbook inflation
 expectations unanchored, description scenario says inflation expectations end
 ½ percentage point higher baseline. looked around baseline time series inflation
 expectations, couldn’t find it. they?
 MR. STOCKTON. Well, that’s good question. reason don’t publish inflation
 expectations series we’re using lot different measures inflation expectations gauge
 underlying inflation is. We’re using lot different models matter, too.
 purely backward-looking models, inflation expectations underlying inflation basically
 proxied lagged inflation. models, explicit measures. example, FRB/US

 add-factor ½ percentage point was.
 Now, think deeper question you’re asking is, think underlying inflation
 currently economy, lies staff’s inflation projection? think
 probably already been, roughly speaking, something like ½ percentage point deterioration underlying
 inflation 2003, actual inflation running little 1 percent.
 thought unusually low, estimate underlying inflation 1½ percent.
 fits forecast probably upward creep roughly
 order ½ percentage point something like 2 percent. scenario showing
 Greenbook deterioration that. recently, wasn’t lot,

 inflation expectations remained well anchored, showing scenarios
 Greenbook take possibility account. noted briefing, although one could use

 supportive consistent underlies forecast, still think it’s early make
 call determination definitively occurred. So, basic view probably

 MR. STOCKTON. Starting last point, increase inflation expectations leads
 almost one one actual inflation, relatively short order. significant shift occurred

 model, inflation inertial variable, two implications. One takes time
 inflation get control, also means it’s extremely costly bring back

 MR. REINHART. I’m sure expertise. Perhaps evolution inflation

 inflation risk premium. think rise inflation compensation due unwinding

 two hands would like make immediate intervention ask question pertaining one
 colleague’s comments. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Incoming data pace economic activity
 surprised slightly upside, although indications housing continuing cool.
 upside surprise concern, given probably neighborhood full employment
 inflation already high side range consider consistent price stability. also
 slightly surprised, unpleasantly so, incoming data core inflation.
 Beginning real side, recent data might signal greater underlying momentum aggregate
 demand, portending going forward. developments intermeeting
 period portend slower growth year. particular, energy prices longer-term interest rates
 risen surprisingly substantially. Taking factors account, marked
 forecast real GDP growth bit latter half 2006 2007. see growth coming
 slightly trend starting second half year unemployment rate moving
 
 May 10, 2006

 toward 5 percent. forecast assumes policy tightened meeting
 next several meetings.
 One development would like comment briefly rise long-term interest rates.
 Since beginning year, nominal ten-year Treasury rate 75 basis points.
 50 basis points increase accounted rise real component, least measured
 TIPS rates. seems natural assume increase real long rates restrain future growth,
 outcome economic activity unambiguous: depends caused real rates rise
 first place, causation far obvious.
 example, higher long-term rates could reflect rational market expectations significantly
 stronger domestic economy next years. explanation strike
 particularly plausible because, although recent data slightly strong side,
 dramatically strong. Moreover, uptick real rates appears especially pronounced implied
 yields long end curve—in distant future, periods well beyond plausible forecast
 horizon.
 second possibility higher U.S. interest rates reflect shift global capital flows away
 United States, perhaps due unwinding carry trade growing concern
 U.S. current account deficit. shift might account sharp drop dollar
 period. simple models, shift portfolio preferences ambiguous effects domestic
 demand depreciation dollar could stimulate aggregate demand higher
 yields depress it. It’s intention overemphasize risk growth slow. point
 simply that, although rise bond rates seems likely help slow economy, take
 granted.
 
 May 10, 2006
 
 30 120
 
 Turning briefly inflation, I’m uncertain whether recent bulge reflects various special
 factors, David mentioned, pass-through energy commodity prices, pressures
 resource utilization. Parsing CPI report, found difficult discern evidence uptick
 reflect pass-through energy commodity prices core inflation. would quite concerned
 uptick reflects pressures resource utilization turns persistent. However, half
 dozen measures slack monitor suggest noticeable change slack since late March.
 measures also suggest vicinity full employment noticeably beyond it. Data
 productivity labor compensation largely reassuring.
 final comment concerns rise inflation compensation since last meeting.
 possibility loss Fed credibility certainly can’t dismissed, believe
 overreact. First, rise we’ve seen line typical volatility series. Second,
 must remember inflation compensation includes expected inflation also inflation
 risk premium. course, elements could higher lessening credibility.
 inflation risk premium could also higher world strikes market participants
 riskier place, perhaps geopolitical concerns nothing credibility.
 Indeed, growing perception world riskier could explain uptick inflation
 compensation due rise inflation risk premium rise TIPS yields due
 higher real interest rate risk. Factor analysis performed staff suggests strong correlation

 inflation rates TIPS yields.
 point determining caused inflation compensation go easy

 contacts, market, though slower, seems healthier realistic.
 wide range contacts spoken since last meeting, want highlight

 and, combined flattening housing markets, affect growth prospects.
 Now, national scene, forecast Greenbook’s. Growth

 Now, again, want overstate problem. think core inflation remain

 First, let say agree comment Governor Warsh made awhile back

 keep way. interest rate policy depend state real economy
 inflation threat. model contained actual expected inflation, real rate interest
 would fluctuate state economy. Given worldwide integration capital markets,
 relevant state U.S. economy also world economy. fed funds rate target

 Now, lag monetary policy effects, think important part concern
 overstay overshoot tight side, note increases federal funds rate
 late last year predicted market outset rate increases mid-2004. Roughly
 speaking, economy already reacted first 300 basis points fed funds rate increases.
 lag argument applies rate increases beyond 4 percent fed funds rate. Inflation expectations
 risen roughly 20 basis points since March meeting. Raising funds rate target 25 basis points today
 barely keeps inflation expectations.
 Many us commented Scylla unemployment Charybdis

 know spell Charybdis. [Laughter] found story, written 2,000 years

 Even inflation rise conclude strong economy requires restraint,

 Conversely, pausing later rate increases backing rates bit pause

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Well, think Bill Poole summarized lot would said.
 forecasted memo sent around. would advocate tightening 50 basis points. would
 dispute one comment President Poole’s. Getting ahead markets less important
 getting ahead economy. take note FOMC surprise chart. question really is,

 much market surprise. We’re going market surprises time,

 market surprise going hit us point, question is, trip wire? risk
 trip wire would housing market. We’ve discussed great degree, although you, Mr.

 like language see growth likely moderate don’t confidence

 Certainly continue downside risks. housing falloff we’re beginning

 fast get there, uncertainty automatically takes alternative B. think
 25 basis points, 50, right move today even though course next several meetings
 may well move 50 beyond that. think 50 basis points would come shock
 markets and, frankly, given I’m really certain things are, would overdo things
 terms perspective need right now. uncertain, moving
 slowly usually wiser policy. that’s policy perspective—25 basis points.
 going fool around alternative B, whole bunch language
 fool around alternative B, gets exactly place new language. [Laughter]
 I’m really happy taken references inflation contained—I think
 row 3—and modest firming row 4. things might work way, it’s I’m
 certain want say directly give impression, would reinforced

 said that, possible, aim making things little—I hesitate use word—more
 uncertain we’re going next meeting rather give certainty pause.
 question, however. second part sentence row 4 sentence row 5
 seem say stuff. need both? must missing something subtle
 seem overlap lot make us double data dependent.

 supports return GDP growth somewhere near long-term potential, along core
 headline inflation beginning turn back year proceeds.
 stated last meeting willing see fed funds rate move best
 estimate neutral level might somewhat restrictive insurance
 adverse inflation effects energy-price shocks hit economy two years

 staff thinks energy shocks add ¾ percent core PCE inflation year. Estimates
 one give comfort deciding reach beyond estimate neutral,

 know historical relationship energy-price shocks weakness

 last meeting, indicated inclined pause meeting. That’s still
 inclination. last CPI report, coupled little direct evidence pace economic activity
 slowing, moved closer putting even odds appropriate choice June meeting.
 said March would like statement induced market participants automatically expect
 better 50 percent chance rate hike June. It’s clear discussion today
 leaning toward rate increase June they’re going wait see data talk
 it. also know people thinking pause, we’re going wait see
 data going talk us it. common theme I’m hearing “wait see,”
 opinion wisest course make smallest possible number changes statement hope
 data speak convincingly next month half.
 preference make changes possible statement made last
 month. think alternative B that. like adding language. second half passage 4

 balanced forecast things train end containing
 risks—maybe driving inflation people want least keeping
 rising. haven’t really seen lot evidence things train contain risks
 yet. acknowledge—President Hoenig made good point—that risk

 really sure inflation front. I’d rather risk overshooting undershooting point
 game.
 need strongly resist tendency inflation rise, public needs
 understand that’s focus is. view, requires ¼ point today conveying sense
 still see upside risks prepared act upside risks inflation materialize. Like
 President Lacker, I’d like see market rates least current level. I’d rather see us ending
 rates little higher otherwise. Conveying thought would probably
 leave rates intact also leave market reactions incoming data constructive. say we’re worried
 inflation inflation comes little higher, markets react quickly. think new

 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. favor 25 basis point increase, and, generally,

 First, want say words topic many us speaking publicly,

 attention, current thinking zone 1 percent 2 percent core PCE.
 use language comfort zone or—as think, Mr. Chairman, said comments—a zone
 price stability, frames public’s interpretation inflation outlook policy
 moves. That’s bad thing, general, concerned many analysts interpreting
 comfort zone range acceptable outcomes doesn’t matter within zone
 indifference.
 don’t view way. preference see inflation moving toward center zone,
 like Bluebook alternative simulation talked before. me, inflation
 forecasts consistently run top end comfort zone problem. Market participants
 ratchet views zone, credibility going suffer. would hope
 policy actions would aimed inflation heading clearly interior range—
 subject, course, constraints dual mandate.
 regard today’s decision, certainly prefer markets clearly understand that,
 necessary, we’re ready move rate 5 percent. think language alternative B that.
 suggest one major change it, think people would consider major, number 3.

 Also, said last time, hard know exactly need go right level.
 best, within 25 basis points would hope things would be, obviously, quite

 emphasize statement First Vice President Stone mentioned: look say line 4,
 specifically mention policy firming may yet needed address inflation risks,
 something specifically singled think helps offset
 concern phrase “inflation expectations remain contained.”
 Although discussed inflation expectations moved somewhat, think say
 longer contained incorrect. seen bit tick-up actual inflation bit tickup some, all, measures inflation expectations. Vince mentioned, recent numbers
 coming Blue Chip suggest professional forecasters saying inflation expectations
 moving up. concerned that, took phrase, while, would
 suggesting think things becoming unhinged might self-fulfilling prophecy
 moving exactly wrong direction. think balance heightens emphasis
 inflation risk number 4 say inflation expectations moved far beyond (and
 think moved far beyond) become unhinged.
 like balance two.
 also like keeping red phrase second part line 4; small amendment make
 perhaps bit easier swallow make seem repetitive statement number 5 that,
 rather saying “in event,” simply say, “The Committee thus respond changes
 economic prospects needed support attainment objectives.” Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.

 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support alternative B would like echo Governor
 Kroszner respect reference inflation expectations remaining contained. light
 market’s expectations are, better worse going today June, omission language

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you. sense probably bit do,
 would helpful signal that. course, cannot sure do, certainly
 cannot sure much more, anything, do.
 sort debated two views optimal path going forward various times. One option
 move confident move leave policy expectations flat. Another
 option say move short pause point leaves positive slope
 path going forward. guess little comfortable latter strategy former.
 Even knew confidence clearly optimal, really would know point
 pause come. always face uncertainty band defines appropriate
 policy path, think still want err upper edge band, wherever is.
 probably want stop tightening inflation peaks, given lags policy operates,
 probably want signal going stop expectations long horizons still moving
 bit.
 final points: think inflation expectations require difficult balance. don’t want look
 though spooked rise inflation expectations, want look though
 indifferent them. see lots ways strike balance.
 rhetorical preference: like use simplifying rhetorical device saying
 going “data dependent” going forward. prefer say going
 “outlook dependent” “forecast dependent” look though going little
 volatile responding near-term changes data. broadly comfortable language B,
 think obviously move 25 basis points today.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let talk bit policy option

 inflation rears ugly head. like, inflation nail, monetary policy hammer.

 two reasons—perhaps two, two. first gather information

 couple questions group. gather people acceded statement,
 let ask couple questions language. first is, Could drop number five?
 reemphasize broad principle respond changes economic prospects, bit
 redundant given previous statement. first question going ask you. second
 question inflation expectations. think would big mistake somehow indicate
 thought contained. First all, factually correct, Vincent’s demonstration
 showed. Second, would convey concern state expectations greater one
 actually have. could do—and little reluctant, open suggestion—would
 say sentence, “Inflation expectations risen slightly remain contained” something like
 that.
 MS. MINEHAN. Instead saying “remain,” could say “are.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. “are contained.”
 MS. MINEHAN. “And inflation expectations contained.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, would say “remain” because, remember, even
 change. contained before, remain contained, despite increase.
 MS. MINEHAN. Yes, “remain” seems say level
 before, whereas “are” says container.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, says still contained. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, like change suggest. important point
 outside world aware recognize change inflation expectations. mean,

 keep exactly before, look though aware happening
 marketplace. think change good one.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. anyone opposite view?
 MR. KROSZNER. think said, Mr. Chairman, putting number 4 singling
 one two objectives—addressing inflation—is going perceived hawkish move relative
 before. Therefore, think making additional change necessary think
 largely conveyed. Given relatively small changes inflation expectations, even
 acknowledge small changes—although saying factually correct—goes
 necessary. share concern wanting make sure clear
 concerned inflation inflation expectations.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. would change language. would leave inflation
 expectations contained, want make sure stay contained. two sentences
 independent one another do. think good balance.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. agree President Hoenig Governor Kroszner.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. First Vice President Stone.
 MR. STONE. Even though said certainly would think it, satisfied
 heard around table balance part 4 part 3. probability harm
 good changing that, even modest changes wording probably worth making.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, subsequent sentence “the potential add inflation
 pressures,” first sentence paragraph 4 say “further policy firming may needed
 
 May 10, 2006

 address inflation risks.” want careful overkill here, even though
 worried inflation.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank comments. right you, President
 Moskow, would like hold evidence little clearer inflation expectations
 moved up. comments? Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Mr. Chairman, number 5, always felt redundant clearly
 communicated long trajectory. near turning point pausing point,
 probably important remind market things happen expect,
 precise forecast, find sentence useful turns long-run
 trajectory. feel good taking really
 redundant.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. see taking “remain contained” would signal change container
 size would probably confuse markets, broadly sympathetic Michael’s point,
 inflation expectations evolve further, going sympathetic that. regard five, taking

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. slight difference refers specifically firming whereas

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. necessary.
 MS. MINEHAN. ways could change language row 4 deal that.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. support leaving row 5 in, support old row 5 referred dual

 sustainable growth all. vague, challenged, could least say forgotten
 dual objectives. omit even indirect reference dual objectives, describe

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. would append Governor Kohn’s remark say

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. strongly support Governor Kohn said.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. President Fisher.

 MR. FISHER. slight heresy, word “information” row 4, would put “in

 MS. MINEHAN. easy ways modify row 4 make thing.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. point, heard discussion, would like propose

 possibility pause. Line 5 responds objectives re-emphasizes fact have,
 course, symmetric employment/inflation objectives. think heard around table times
