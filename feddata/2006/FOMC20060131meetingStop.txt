 anecdotal information available data suggest economic growth southeast region

 markets, including several hot time, like Florida. Banks clearly
 pulling back construction lending. We’re receiving increasing numbers reports

 we’re beginning see signs downward pressure prices—in cases high

 general real estate situation still feels pretty solid.
 I’d also like make couple comments situation hurricane areas, where,
 according staff , FEMA spending turned less expected fourth quarter.

 Considerable uncertainty exists concerning federal flood insurance policies going forward,
 certain areas rebuilding take place flood maps redrawn, building codes
 reassessed, soil contamination assessed, permits issued—all could take many,
 many months. people able move back properties, even
 homes modestly damaged storm beginning show signs
 deterioration due mold lack maintenance repairs. think take-away
 discussion economic kick we’ve expecting hurricane rebuilding probably
 going spread 2006, 2007, perhaps even bit further.
 damage energy sector Gulf appears worse

 half crude oil shut attributable production lost Shell’s Mars

 relatively positive scenario. 90 percent confidence interval given Greenbook
 clearly indicates, considerable uncertainty around baseline. theoretical world

 times, world practical policymaking, uncertainty resolved matter
 importantly policy judgments.
 mere cadet, will, sitting next monetary policy Yoda, [laughter]
 attempt look uncertainties understand may unfold

 One particularly salient aspect uncertainty relates way inflation expectations
 
 January 31, 2006
 
 59 106
 
 influenced energy prices. we’ve seen recently, despite spiking oil prices December, nearterm inflation expectations remained stable edged even somewhat lower, reversing run-up
 saw fall. presentation morning showed, preliminary January Michigan
 survey results median inflation expectations coming year ticked down, median fiveand ten-year inflation expectations also moved lower. Rate spreads TIPS also indicated
 remarkably contained inflation expectations despite oil price shocks.
 stability remarkable quite important, because, view least,
 optimal course monetary policy juncture depends critically fragility stability
 inflation expectations presence oil price shock. judge that, least,
 important element uncertainty supports continued execution strategy following

 again. course, slight rise near-term inflation outlook and, fact, slight
 deterioration near-term inflation itself, prudence require close monitoring variables
 go forward. thus far, judge announced strategy consistent maintaining
 credibility.
 Second, discussed earlier, great uncertainty long-term rates low
 shape level yield curve may imply us. saw yesterday’s Board

 low term premium increased assessment part global investors future
 looks like environment involving less risk usual. borne think Dino’s pie
 charts earlier also global equity markets. I’d also say, based various conversations
 I’ve central bankers January various committees attend others attend
 Chairman, general sense world policy low-risk assessment
 approximately right. However, continue think lower rates reflect forces
 holding back investment demand globally. And, United States, think also reflect
 drag external sector. However, corporate balance sheets good shape global
 growth firming, don’t expect sudden reassessment risk rise term premium result
 sources.
 concern may see snapback term premiums another source
 we’ve touched bit already, that’s third final uncertainty wish look at,
 housing sector. I’d say President Santomero’s comments sense preceded
 introduced mine. don’t doubt housing market slowing somewhat, wonder
 impact slowing house prices wealth extraction household saving
 consumption. pick Dave left off, models take historical norm.
 Let’s say we’re 3 percent Dave indicated. think there’s possibly greater risk,
 reasons Dave already indicated, may find much stronger impact global
 
 January 31, 2006

 economy, certainly U.S. economy, based slowing housing prices. here, though
 recognize economies different, still somewhat troubled experience
 United Kingdom, Australia, Netherlands, unexpectedly large impact,
 GDP standpoint, relatively slow flattening house prices. recognize
 economies different ours, I’d also say we’ve seen even economy
 nonlinearities emerged—for example, asset prices moved relatively
 rapidly—that might surprised us past.
 what’s implication uncertainties? I’d like put three things
 table meeting. First, continue believe, think Greenbook Bluebook does,
 equilibrium real rate has, fact, moved somewhat average, lower was,
 let’s say, past ten years, exception recessionary periods 2001 2002.
 Second, firmly believe, many you, well within range neutrality
 stage. And, third, since would say there’s great deal uncertainty here, want make sure
 say, word deed, reflects great deal flexibility. heard Vice Chairman
 Geithner suggest want put words say it’s probable we’ll move
 next meeting. suggest little nuanced put words suggest it’s
 least possible move next meeting.
 said that, obviously, I, along everyone else, think happens
 going forward extraordinarily data-dependent. reason us keep,
 will, powder dry options open. Thank much, Mr. Chairman.

 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. preparing meeting early last
 week, feeling comfortable forecast good growth 2006, mid-3 percent
 range near potential, modest uptick core inflation 2 percent. many
 already remarked, GDP numbers Friday made slightly pessimistic, growth
 inflation. surprise drop government spending, full confidence turn around.
 Final sales fell, however, growth occurred fourth quarter came
 inventory growth. Given inventory–sales ratios continue run historically low levels,
 though, inventories continue source growth going forward. many also
 noted, indicators show much stronger performance. Initial unemployment claims, goods
 orders, capacity utilization, strong corporate balance sheets—all effectively say

 strong foundation underneath growth. inflation numbers ticking 2.2 percent
 gave bit pause. came two good quarters, second third quarters,
 low inflation; again, uptick shows much variability see around inflation
 numbers quarter quarter warrants attention.
 one area—and want second Dave Stockton’s remark—of main concern
 housing market. Let talk little differently previous comments today.
 look aggregate levels debt households relative prices, one
 things old lender worry ability service debt discretionary spending
 households have. 80 percent mortgages fixed rate, 20 percent variable.
 Starting 2002, saw jump ARMs, taking advantage steep yield curve

 Greenbook, you’ll notice financial obligation ratio rose quite substantially past six
 months. back peaks 2001 2002, lot mortgages still
 reprice. also know exotic mortgages don’t amortize, kick
 start amortization also pull cash discretionary spending.
 overall look consumers, housing cost heating winter rising,
 you’re beginning see little caution borrowing numbers. drop home equity lines

 Consumer credit whole dropped, excluding mortgage credit, mortgage growth whole

 borrowing, housing general. look ability consumers spend
 discretionarily monthly take-home pay, signals need look at.

 sad thing last meeting Chairman, personally
 also want echo comments colleagues around table thank
 leadership. I’ve impressed kind atmosphere found joined
 tenure leader institution. integrity everything done, emphasis
 quality ideas, continuing search new ways look information—because
 economy dynamic—remind us watch new things always evolving.

 finally, old risk manager, glad feel right home approach monetary
 policy. [Laughter] thank leadership. pleasure served
 you.

 expected federal funds rate, plotted black top right side, moves
 modestly 4½ percent spring turning late year.
 Market participants apparently bought notion that, inflation
 impetus bit intense, Committee want real federal funds rate,
 solid black line middle panel, assuredly range associated
 policy accommodation. market participants seem bought
 idea you’ll act like hypothetical policymakers described
 Bluebook. paths nominal real federal funds rates, derived

 policymakers financial market participants perfect foresight, shown
 bottom panels. solid dotted lines policy prescriptions
 inflation goals 1½ percent 2 percent, respectively. actual inflation
 FRB/US measure long-run expected inflation running around 2 percent,
 policymakers hold nominal funds rate steady allow real funds rate
 drift lower achieve 2 percent core PCE inflation long run. induce enough
 resource slack work toward 1½ percent inflation goal, however, policymakers
 would raise nominal funds rate 5 percent.
 Market participants see steering two paths while—
 probably combination three reasons. first two explain why—even
 goal inflation 1½ percent—you might less aggressive
 corresponding simulation. one, market participants may see less near-term
 pressures inflation Greenbook extension. another, may
 believe you’d tolerate inflation toward high end range, part
 perception would unwilling create economic slack deliberately
 achieve different outcome. Instead, may think willing wait
 opportunity future, negative shock pulls inflation down. third
 reason that—even aiming inflation 2 percent—you might
 tighter corresponding simulation. particular, market participants may
 believe policy choice shaped considerations risks
 deterministic simulations cannot capture. example, might satisfied
 inflation around current levels, ensured, asymmetrically concerned
 regard higher rather lower. Thus, might tighten
 2 percent goal simulation insurance inflation move higher.
 If, like market participants, see operating range
 two paths called optimal control exercises, likely would
 willing tighten ¼ point today place high odds March.
 two chief wording issues follow decision listed top
 exhibit 2. First, high odds place tightening March meeting?
 writing Bluebook, thought you’d want preserve current configuration
 financial market prices, appears based 70–30 split tightening
 versus action six weeks. Thus, portion statement language

 attainment sustainable economic growth price stability roughly
 balance.” thought wording gives strong presumption policy
 tighten certainty makes many uncomfortable.
 I’ve heard today, would suggest tweaking verb phrase dial
 market’s perception future action removing word “well.”
 second question is, strongly want underscore coming
 decisions depend incoming economic data? thought last sentence
 December statement, also repeated bottom left panel, provided sufficient
 assurance score. Indeed, layout seemed attraction
 expressing back-up strategy would deviate anticipated policy
 path events dictate. also thought you’d want make changes
 language possible today. alternative reverse order last two
 sentences, done bottom right. “The Committee respond changes

 growth price stability. circumstances, Committee judges

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, I, too, think move

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. agree second point

 support increase federal funds rate today. I’m little concerned, like Vice Chairman,
 “may” language could cause bit rally financial markets, think reflects
 general tone around table certainly close thinking. think we’re likely
 firm next meeting—the odds 50–50 greater—and puts market
 notice that’s approximately thinking is. agree one.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Santomero.
 MR. SANTOMERO. support recommendation terms 25 basis points also

 like ordering presented here. fits well view be.
 last point, I’d like compliment Vince predicting yet back talking
 it. [Laughter] think that’s right path. think bringing everybody’s attention
 good thing. third solution, somewhere between, actually right answer.
 one fosters consensus around tricky, I’m glad don’t it.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. support increase 25 basis points meeting. would like add
 third question two Vince gave us top exhibit 2. language creates best
 basis smooth transition future language? Every time make change, gets parsed,

 reversal two sentences make thought might easier transition
 future. Clearly, it’s fine point, that’s end dealing order provide
 signals didn’t really intend.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. Well, support 25 basis point move. think President Poole made
 good point. wrote note support it, accept language that’s here. Then, finally,
 full accord President Reserve Bank New York’s articulation issue

 really prefer that. agree postponing discussion procedure next meeting.
 There’s much done, think transition need wait then.
 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. find agreement with, guess,
 everybody already spoken. ¼ point increase seems appropriate me. I’m

 Fifty-fifty? don’t know. sure 50–50 chance, maybe is. okay
 that.

 I’d also like raise concern Monday–Tuesday going become commonplace.
