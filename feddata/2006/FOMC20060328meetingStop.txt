 three related questions remarks afternoon. First, much momentum

 put place sufficient restraint prevent output overshooting potential,
 attendant consequences inflation? finally, view current state
 resource utilization, implications assessment
 inflation outlook?
 Let turn first question momentum. last FOMC meeting,
 indicated staff state denial concerning meager 1 percent rate

 bounce back sharply current quarter. relieved report subsequent
 developments appear supported interpretation. estimate

 quarter.
 Although, broad strokes, developments paint picture close
 envisioned January, share surprises contend with.
 notably, consumer spending business spending considerably stronger
 projected. Real PCE projected advanced annual rate
 5¼ percent quarter. strength reflects bounceback motor vehicle
 purchases. even setting aside, real PCE appears track 4¼ percent
 increase current quarter, nearly percentage point faster projected
 January Greenbook.
 business sector, projecting increase real outlays equipment
 software nearly 15 percent annual rate first quarter. Like consumer
 outlays, real spending E&S boosted motor vehicle sales quarter,
 received bump-up recovery aircraft deliveries. even
 abstracting jump spending transportation equipment, real E&S
 expected increase 10 percent annual rate current quarter, nearly 3
 percentage points faster previously projected.
 surprises also extended beyond spending data. Gains private
 payroll employment revised fourth quarter averaged 200,000
 per month January February—a bit expectation. job gains,
 coupled higher-than-expected workweek, raised growth hours worked
 current quarter 3 percent annual rate, nearly 2 percentage points
 faster anticipated January. readings manufacturing industrial
 production also exceeded expectations. Factory output estimated
 increased 9 percent annual rate fourth quarter projected
 increase 6 percent rate current quarter; increases are, respectively,
 1 percentage point ½ percentage point greater written
 January.
 rather lengthy litany might suggest answer first question
 posed great deal momentum activity
 earlier expected. But, fact, two reasons, I’d characterize situation one
 perceive little momentum. First, downside
 surprises well upside ones. example, construction activity business
 sector state local governments fallen short expectations.
 biggest downside surprise, however, come external sector, surge
 imports first quarter suggests additional strength domestic
 spending met foreign rather domestic producers.
 second reason interpreting recent strength added momentum
 already see evidence, admittedly tentative, strength
 first quarter transitory. one, jump federal spending first
 quarter mostly reflects rebound low level outlays fourth quarter,

 given year’s federal budget, real purchases edge

 And, finally, data retail sales, shipments capital goods, industrial
 production suggest impetus rapid first-quarter growth

 I’m tempted chalk situation victory staff projection,

 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. share view slow growth
 fourth quarter last year was, fact, temporary aberration offset strong firstquarter growth neighborhood 4½ 5 percent. Auto sales already bounced back,
 defense spending unlikely continue declining. business investment spending looks

 Although would characterize outlook solid, even encouraging, significant
 uncertainties risks surround outlook. I’d like comment several risks and,
 so, include observations region’s experience contacts seem
 relevant.
 first set uncertainties mind revolves around residential real estate
 adjustment unfold—something Dave Janet already talked about. Although
 decline construction sales slowing price appreciation seem orderly far,
 clearly could disruptive set changes foresee. reported
 last meeting, seeing significant downward price adjustments cancellation

 especially mortgage rates continue increase. Adding unknowns regard

 rebuilding. Greenbook built measurable near-term contribution
 reconstruction, continue believe we’re going surprised protracted
 rebuilding going turn be.
 brings second concern—our admitted uneasiness well explain
 behavior long-term interest rates cycle, something talked earlier
 done much recently. Despite new academic look I’m working on, [laughter] don’t
 think add genius possible explanations already offered current past
 Chairmen, Vice Chairman Geithner, others. FOMC table heyday
 so-called new economy, thought quite could explain
 significantly different behavior, important elements economy, learn hindsight
 phenomena turned revert past relationships past experience.
 Clearly, unexpected uptick long-term rates, including mortgage rates, would come
 complete surprise. would affect household business spending. see risk
 careful dismiss quickly.
 two uncertainties I’ve talked represent downside risks output. There’s
 another development think tends offset downside worries. Job growth
 strong; fact, region hearing reports shortages new workers
 number industries certain job skills. time, much made stagnant
 wages workers. staff analyzed data wages types jobs
 created relative destroyed found that, although wage dynamics
 deteriorate 2001 2003, wage relationships since returned historical norms.
 
 March 27-28, 2006

 Moreover, business surveys National Association Business Economics
 National Federation Independent Businesses suggest that, although firms put lid wage
 increases 2001-04 period, net projection firms raising wages become
 widespread, 1990s. rebound suggests
 wage growth net job creation lending support spending
 recent past, taking pressure sources funding, home equity
 extraction.
 recent post-FOMC meeting statements indicated, upside inflation risks also
 remain. It’s still clear we’ve seen full long-term adjustment households
 businesses elevated energy prices. continue hear reports energy
 commodity cost pass-throughs people would like make, reports rollbacks earlier
 energy surcharges far between.
 Although I’m proponent NAIRU way thinking relationship
 unemployment expected pressure inflation—a relationship hard see recent
 empirical data—we need watch carefully ever new bottlenecks price
 pressures solid expansion four years old. fact, even though see risk
 current expected policy setting getting close balance, good central banker remain
 least bit concerned potential inflation edge somewhat higher.
 argue tomorrow significantly tighter policy help push inflation rate moderately down,

 energy particularly strong point. job skills, particularly health care,
 accounting auditing, technology, energy sector, short supply. Consumer spending
 overall well maintained, nonresidential construction activity appears improving.
 Housing activity little difficult summarize. Construction remains strong; sales still
 relatively substantial, best determine; inventories unsold properties rising well.
 Turning national economy, said earlier wasn’t particularly concerned

 deteriorate, employment declining income growth slowing declining forth,
 would expect broadly based more-severe problems housing.
 second issue I’d like spend little time inflation outlook. question
 asked is, likely appreciable acceleration inflation point, particularly
 light steps taken get federal funds rate back reasonable range? First,
 would argue inflation expectations remain well anchored point. don’t hear, go
 around talk various groups meet various business people, doubt among
 participants Fed’s ongoing commitment low inflation. think
 available data support that. One things looking chart one-, five-, tenyear rates core PCE inflation. look that, see ten-year rate
 inflation declining steadily little 2 percent. five-year rate
 basically pattern. leveled 2000, it, too, little 2 percent. And,
 course, one-year rate inflation, although bounces around lot more, ends
 place, also little 2 percent. don’t sense

 Another topic would comment briefly issue lags policy. is,
 presumably full effects actions we’ve already taken yet felt.
 Finally, looked forecasting equations try incorporate growth

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.

 talked several corporate CFOs past couple weeks, also

 also expecting raise wages salaries faster, 4.2 percent coming year.

 corporate America continuing.
 look survey small businesses, read kinds trends

 corporate America going continue push earnings growth production clearly

 Now, look household sector. noticing past months

 productivity. unit labor costs helped modify inflation. heard CFOs
 exactly trying do—to find ways improve productivity
 handle higher wage cost finding skills short areas.
 highly skilled people probably also productive, average, folks may
 looking jobs, hiring more-productive workers could also help way.
 think good job growth faster wage increases also help put floor
 housing sales. know concerned terms mortgage

 still relatively high. Mortgage rates long end really moved much last
 couple years. extent many new mortgages financed adjustable-rate

 Finally, follow comments made, see still

 Let spend moments business capital expenditure side.
 view strength business capital expenditure property, plant, equipment may well
 surprise upside. think saw earlier recovery, anecdotally well

 CEO said couple weeks ago, big company CEOs gotten memo.
 Opportunities drive profit margins productivity improvements appear diminishing
 somewhat, appears tendency, greater willingness, go back well
 get cap-ex back speed. Two obvious indicia greater cap-ex—which we’ve seen

 would like spend little time is, well, new? going make

 seems Greenbook projects uptick would temporary, needn’t
 respond. statement B essentially says, “Look. run-up energy prices

 world transpires, end think says regard upside risk forecast
 elevated prices energy commodities potential add inflation pressure.
 if, point fact, Greenbook right start seeing 2.2 core PCE, markets
 conclude? “Yes, they’re worried about. They’re really worried upside risk
 inflation forecast inflation going come high. conclude
 negative surprise Committee, therefore going go 5
