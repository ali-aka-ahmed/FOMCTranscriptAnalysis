 MR. STOCKTON. Roughly speaking, held back June level, would

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Dave, two measures labor compensation typically look
 at—compensation per hour employment cost index—over long period track

 fairly closely, shorter run there’s variance. Even though we’ve seen recent
 downward revisions compensation per hour, it’s still running higher ECI.
 wondering approached weighing two series assessment labor
 market also outlook inflation would change put weight ECI,
 lower compensation per hour.
 MR. STOCKTON. answer latter question: really threw away information

 solely ECI, we’d lower inflation forecast. overall price inflation projection,
 use variety models. talked little earlier year got big upward

 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. two questions sort related.
 first question acceleration core PCE prices saw earlier year
 obviously concerned about. One rationale we’ve offered trying understand
 acceleration pass-through effects previous year’s rise energy prices
 $50 barrel something like $75 barrel. Given energy prices fallen
 looks though they’re stabilizing around $60 barrel least now, measure
 effect pass-through core PCE prices roughly 20 percent drop oil prices?
 see measurement going headline; look forecasts core,
 haven’t responded effect. much pass-through model core PCE prices
 energy prices, not? I’m trying understand guys think that.
 second question related inflation well. trying understand automobile
 thing—which clearly entirely understand point—I saw suggestion
 apparently anomalous large drop occurred PPI trucks something like that. real
 accurate? ramifications anomalous drop PPI?
 measurement problem carry price indexes—for example, CPI? carry
 over, mean estimates CPI perhaps understated near term
 measurement problem? don’t know whether there’s relation
 two. two questions.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let confine remarks couple
 discussions economy bolster themes several noted. outset,
 I’ll say continue concerned level inflation progress
 regarding growth. economy appears track, think, unlike
 Greenbook projections, there’s prospect upside surprises growth. let
 spend moments looking labor markets, corporate profit markets, household
 balance sheets, consumer spending coming back capital markets little
 broadly.
 First, labor market side, noted previously, continue
 surprisingly strong job gains, particularly point cycle. trend revisions,
 regardless data series, tends continuing upward. labor markets continue

 accept new workers labor force smoothly, participation rate highest
 since 2003, suggests dynamism market. Hiring plans small businesses
 moved highest level nearly two years tend pretty good forward-looking
 indicator, perhaps better indicator large companies. light that, think
 Greenbook rightly acknowledges household survey may imply even greater strength
 payroll data suggest.
 Second, turning profits picture, continue remarkable profits
 S&P, Dow, broader markets, predicated strong cash flows record profit
 margins. Broad-based NIPA profits 30 percent pre-tax third quarter. S&P
 delivered 20 percent profit gains third quarter. think trend particularly telling.

 Third, turning household balance sheets, net worth grew $3½ trillion past four
 quarters, Fed’s flow funds data suggest. Assets growing faster liabilities,
 whether include exclude housing, look past four quarters. Continuing
 remarkable levels household corporate liquidity continue suggest good news.
 Although data see growth household debt relative income, trend

 MR. STERN. going say I’m one here, Committee anyway,

 MR. KOHN. Getting back communication issues, have, first, bit January

 two considerations closely related, focus really forecasting process

 Committee toward something. Committee something, think need

 confusing public might come out, setting inaccurate expectations
 we’re coming out, provoking reactions public something Committee might

 room—to control public statements issue. us others don’t,

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
 MR. HOENIG. agree. can’t imagine putting position public. I’m concerned
 get questions: “This minutes. think?” feel little uncomfortable
 saying, “I’m going talk that.” feel comfortable saying, “That’s
 tough issue. We’ve gone back forth. need think through. strong views.”
 
 December 12, 2006

 mean talk bit without putting big position there. don’t want say them,
 “I’m talking this.” sounds incomplete half-baked.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. would interpret Tom’s “no comment issue”
 inconsistent proposing, Don.
 MR. KOHN. Right. think talk without giving position. mean,
 people asked me, I’ve said, “There number things consideration. lot
 issues need work through.”
 MR. HOENIG. feel comfortable without giving out, “This ought do,”
 sort thing. That’s helpful.
 MR. MISHKIN. think there’s fine line here. It’s extremely important us
 taking positions, exactly along lines suggested. question
 educating public issues, specifics. fine line, I’m sure
 think question: Whatever decide, point don’t want
 spring public, obvious reasons. role communication terms educating
 public issues, many discussing—for example, speeches
 importance anchoring inflation expectations. Now, communicate
 actually one issues discuss. public understand monetary
 policy important terms education process, yet also need make
 sure getting details. there’s fine line here. might interesting
 hear participants achieve getting public understand
 monetary policy really about, lot public doesn’t, yet actually create
 expectations we’re going go one way another terms communication. certainly
 don’t want cut discussion, ongoing Federal Reserve

 public—actually quite successfully. It’s amazing look public ten years ago
 versus now, it’s speeches, articles, written
 communication System quite successfully.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. I’d like point respond questions pointing
 brief mention minutes Committee talking communication issues.
 also remind people details proceedings confidential released
 minutes, statements, testimony, eventually transcript. “Not liberty” standard
 response deliberations around table. thing would add
 us record long time. get questions inflation
 targets, say first speech made outside St. Louis, came St. Louis Fed,
 included discussion issue, repeat said eight years ago leave that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. I’d like echo points, makes issue
 ways much subtle difficult pull off. agree Rick 100 percent. Part job
 education. walk line talking subtleties monetary policy
 issues confront us educating public, last thing want clam
 monetary policy extent public doesn’t get educated doesn’t understand
 we’re why. important bring along us degree
 talk it. point would reinforce Bill said: Many us record
 points view issues, can’t deny exist.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let say things. First all, freedom
 individual members speak important value. trying way suppress

 that. Second, agree Governor Mishkin education process important. Third,
 would say past positions past positions, one asking anyone repudiate anything.
 think response President Hoenig perfectly appropriate—to acknowledge issue,
 acknowledge arguments sides, acknowledge even past positions.
 point avoid actively taking strong, specific positions particular issues really
 debate Committee. think Committee would agree, example, good
 communication important arguments sides inflation targeting.
 But, Governor Kohn said, want make sure atmosphere within Committee
 conducive getting agreement. others explain Congress
 others, want make sure haven’t heard different positions that, fact,
 reflect come with. please don’t overstate we’re discussing here. mean,
 we’re asking anything like “mum’s word,” simply requesting
 perspective vigor advocate specific positions next months.
 President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. Actually, think Vice Chair Geithner slightly ahead me.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. No, go ahead.
 MS. MINEHAN. Thank you. think Don’s points, Mr. Chairman, well
 made. Coming maybe little different perspective lot people do, think
 there’s lot say Committee already done realm
 communications. big watershed 1994—in actually telling people doing.
 say lot positive—for example, timeliness bring minutes out.
 Also, can’t see people difficulty understanding issues left resolve.
 people ask question communications, say we’ve taken really major steps
 
 December 12, 2006

 we’re contemplating meet objectives monetary policy better.
 view that, matter stand subject, solid track record
 Committee action talk without even getting inflation targeting.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Let say couple things. think Rick’s point
 education right. make statement educating people virtues price
 stability anchoring long-term inflation expectations reason that’s important, without
 taking challenge educating people today alternative ways achieving
 objective. debate inflation targeting communications really means ends;
 view education latter issue means avoid taking challenge
 educating public know want go. know want go,
 figure best create broader public foundation make possible. I’m sure
 we’ll different views that.
 second point past positions. easy don’t past
 positions issues echo repudiate public. would make slightly different
 suggestion way respond questions from, think, Bill. refer people
 past positions without repeating substance nuance. don’t know
 Chairman Vice Chairman Board plan do, expect won’t feel need
 public going forward repeat past positions issues. suspect refer
 people past positions without reminding were. distinction
 important, think, don’t know get repeating summarizing past
 position without inevitably getting broader set choices we’re going debating
 Committee.

 One final point, think said eloquently say it,
 interest discussion take place radar screen public debate until,
 again, better sense consensus going lie. move
 public debate, risk face concerns Governor Kohn referred to.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. quickly, think what’s clear discussion that, dealing
 issue inflation targeting, there’s need offensive. issue
 handle defensive—and think Vice Chairman Geithner’s point correct—if talk
 ends desires monetary policy rather getting means. know, Mr.
 Chairman, last discussion worried sent around first draft
 minutes—I think President Minehan well—even ended saying
 minutes. So, again, view less said, better. defensive, would
 urge everybody stress fact topic discussion decision
 made try make simple quick possible.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let’s bring discussion end. Everyone
 use judgment, wanted bring attention
 considerations think public appearances. date next meeting January
 30 31. meeting adjourned.
