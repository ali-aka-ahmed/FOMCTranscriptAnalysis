 District. Unemployment rates low, directors contacts continue report
 shortages skilled labor across District. District agricultural conditions remain rather
 mixed. Drought continues affect much western part region. However, livestock
 crop prices supported strong world demand lower supply, farmers
 able bring crop quite well.
 Turning national economy, think recent decline energy prices
 provide important support near-term outlook. Currently, see second-half growth
 around 2 percent, rebounding 2½ 3 percent get next year. Generally
 speaking, optimistic Greenbook, near term next year.
 Indeed, current financial conditions others talked about, don’t envision

 projected point.
 One area worth discussion—and Dave talked bit responding

 Dave said, different perspective. Although demographic forces clearly work

 another significant factor keep mind educational composition labor force
 skills composition move forward terms labor demand, that’s
 shortage we’re always hearing about.
 Now, returning near-term outlook, recent decline energy prices helped
 counter effects housing weaknesses. Consequently, downside risk outlook
 diminished somewhat. However, necessarily seen bottom
 housing market, believe important downside risk economy.
 Finally, let share perspective inflation outlook. overall views
 inflation changed materially since last meeting. continue expect core CPI
 inflation moderate 2.8 percent 2.5 percent next year and, similarly, core
 PCE inflation moderate 2.3 percent 2.1 percent. significant fall prices
 oil gasoline natural gas recent weeks already begun show overall
 inflation. believe positive development helping ensure inflation expectations
 remain anchored perhaps helping moderate core inflation next year. Although
 decline energy prices reduced upside risk inflation somewhat, agree others
 core inflation remain high, think keep mind consider
 policy options. Thank you.

 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start saying think Greenbook

 downside that, come hunches gut instinct. want emphasize
 don’t want make policy basis gut instinct, think helps keep open mind
 things might going on.
 First, positive side, UPS contact says expecting peak season
 glut volume enough lift. They’re going move express business trucks.
 you’re counting getting last minute present Christmastime, urge order little
 earlier might otherwise. That’s expectation. labor side, UPS fairly
 big increases coming next year consequence recent contracts signed. long
 negotiation pilots, ground side, obviously less skilled workers, they’re expecting
 3½ percent compensation, much line normal situation.
 Wal-Mart contact said experienced pickup sales
 would anticipated decline energy prices. expected increase
 65 basis points. always measure sales same-store, year year. haven’t seen
 that. They’re going lucky get 2 percent year-over-year October. contact says
 weekly information suggests October slowing week week go

 warrants. expecting increase square footage 7.6 percent ’07 compared

 8.4 percent ’06—so slowdown hardly gigantic. Construction costs year rising
 17 percent; next year they’re anticipating 11 12 percent. slowdown increase,
 11 12 percent still pretty big increase construction costs.
 contact trucking industry says—and may make little explicit
 Richard Fisher saying—that things industry continuing slow down. says it’s

 People around table and, think, generally treating oil price declines

 Autos seem likely short-lived effect. case housing, agree

 MR. STOCKTON. It’s amazing great answers questions 3 o’clock

 First, issue President Yellen raised expectational channel. That’s
 pretty small piece story way model simulations work, don’t think
 worry much significant factor. small factor slowing pace
 disinflation. model guys tell dollar channel probably important
 factor there.
 Second, response President Moskow’s question house-price modeling,
 said several models house-price determination, none
 think good. [Laughter] One error-correction model takes seriously notion
 that, house prices high relative rents, there’s correction bring
 price-rent ratio back historical average, estimate speed correction.
 model taken seriously would suggest outright house-price declines 2007 2008. also
 simpler model based momentum. model suggests bit deceleration
 nowhere near amount deceleration suggested error-correction model. forecast
 cuts two simply indication ignorance models
 might best capturing current situation.
 Third, response President Pianalto’s question, besides notion
 less-persistence scenario could reflect greater credibility anchoring monetary policy,
 structural changes could taking place economy terms greater flexibility labor
 markets maybe greater price flexibility well. don’t think that’s unreasonable
 hypothesis. One could think surprised extent workers taken
 significant hit real wage time without trying recoup higher
 nominal wages. may indicate labor markets maybe product markets changing

 continue report modest increases home sales prices even permits, many

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, again, said, five
 weeks don’t whole lot new information. I’m coming back starting
 housing again. know, continues something watch. Let make
 comments give recent feedback exams dialogues brokers I’d
 like share you. Looking starts permits, know housing
 continuing soften terms construction, also identified increasing number
 contract cancellations new housing. Someone mentioned earlier noise may
 around housing data, get anecdotal conversations I’ve
 folks. One topic inventory existing housing sale. I’m hearing
 couple real estate brokers people may wanted sell homes may
 put sale withdrawing market. don’t need move,
 isn’t worthwhile move don’t get price want. think supply
 possibly bigger we’re really measuring, we’re seeing understating
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 61 203
 
 desired house sales would terms inventory. That’s continuing; beginning
 stage, least couple regions, according folks I’ve talked.
 One challenges we’re faced that—again, try look good
 news—in housing purchase process, people file applications mortgages often
 qualify buy house. look Mortgage Bankers Association data
 purchase mortgage applications, mentioned before, dropped 20 percent peak
 last summer, past months leveling off. applications
 leading indicator, may begin see moderation housing purchases. However, 20
 percent drop purchase mortgage applications means mortgage brokers earning lot
 less income. don’t close transaction, get paycheck three
 four mortgages originated financial institutions independent brokers. We’re
 beginning see increasing evidence terms quality mortgages
 there. continue track mortgages vintages—in words,
 originated—in 2005, continuing see that, mortgages age, early
 delinquencies greater early delinquencies similar-aged mortgages earlier
 vintages, implies loosening underwriting standards stress borrowers.
 also seeing small way increased predatory activity loans. Certain
 practices described lately new products, 2-28 mortgage,
 fixed two years escalates becomes ARM tied LIBOR third year.
 don’t worry—you refinance broker bring payment
 again. We’re seeing kinds things—mortgages people
 qualified brokers escrow account; sudden taxes due, borrowers don’t
 money them. predatory lending rearing head lower end scale,
 
 October 24-25, 2006

 it’s something continue watch for. However, leave housing, let
 say bottom line overall mortgage credit quality still very, strong.
 We’re seeing predatory lending pockets market.
 continue believe rest economy—except autos, add—is still
 strong. Consumer spending good, business fixed investment sound.
 moderation energy prices growth consumer income continue add support
 economy going forward. Jobless claims low moving narrow range

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 63 203
 
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. views quite consistent
 expressed five weeks ago central tendency many speakers today—that is,
 greater concern inflation prospects growth prospects. thought I’d
 give maybe three four perspectives market activity intermeeting period
 suggest conclusions draw conclusions I’d hesitate
 draw.
 First, noted last meeting, growth equity markets
 earnings multiples. markets record eighteenth double-digit quarterly
 growth rate, quarterly growth third quarter likely exceed, annualized basis,
 second quarter, one level would see reasons earnings momentum
 robustness Greenbook shows prospect business fixed investment. Despite
 headlines, think Greenbook probably general slowdown business fixed
 investment general slowdown manufacturing right. Again, superficial
 level would think stock prices would juicing business activity—that animal
 spirits would high they’ve ever been. fact, say
 confidence historical models cash profits done poor job indicating
 strength business demand would here. Although business demand certainly picked
 cycle, appears picked dramatically lot data might
 suggest.
 mean? think means generally still conservatism
 board rooms, conservatism CFOs. Although plenty ammunition terms
 access capital markets cash balances, we’ll likely see use it’s
 clear economy turned. soft landing followed gradual acceleration
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 64 203
 
 appear likely path, would expect see companies put feet
 accelerator bit make sure growth gets back trend relatively quickly.
 idea businesses going turbo-charge way without hesitation appears
 less likely data would suggest.
 Second, let turn debt markets. discussion among pundits tug
 war going growth risks inflation risks. look data debt
 markets, must say don’t see tug war. tug war really soft
 landing harder landing, view inflation almost assuredly going solved
 central bank exogenous factors. Again, superficial conclusion would be, boy,
 markets worried inflation, take great comfort it. Rather, thing
 gives greatest pause that, inflation nowhere table capital
 markets now, could quickly emerge; would take much data, us would
 consider relatively noisy perhaps overly valid, inflation become part
 discussion debt markets. That’s something think prepare for. suspect,
 think balance year, another round discussions capital markets
 inflation scare quite possible.
 third issue really one short-term volatility, tend overreact to,
 think particular case telling. Typically, several weeks quarter, markets’
 assessment quarter’s GDP ends trending toward truth ends without huge
 disparity get closer smarter underlying information. reason
 doubt staff’s view third-quarter GDP likely come around 1 percent.
 Nonetheless, markets’ estimates quite far away that. Market estimates have, fact,
 trended down, I’d say median estimate market still high ones, maybe even
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 65 203
 
 2 percent. question really is, come Friday, headline number posts way
 staff suggests will, market say that. view
 immediate rush judgment probably amplified downside political season like this.
 say, “Boy, economy really wrong track, economic landing
 hard one.” Whether judgment dissipates markets look forward start
 understand reasons shortfall bit concern. Also, marketplace may
 view that, landing relatively hard fast, pace economic growth
 work us inflation front. Obviously don’t think view shared many us
 around table; fact, might work us do. wouldn’t surprise
 markets didn’t, end period, expect couple rate cuts built first
 half 2007, suspect we’ll need send back give another speech.
 [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. second motion. [Laughter]
 MR. WARSH. mean real economy? Again, I’d break
 two pieces. First, terms consumer reaction function, think consumers going
 stubborn strong going overly scared third-quarter GDP
 number don’t really pay much attention to. fundamental level
 feeling much better prospects felt time, function
 wage growth we’ve seen function oil prices unemployment
 rate. don’t really worry short intermediate effect consumer.
 think Greenbook consumer spending continuing fourth quarter something like
 3 percent. That’s probably conservative estimate given strength
 underlying fundamentals. Second, what’s effect real economy businesses?
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 66 203
 
 I’m concerned reaction function. Despite rather robust discussion
 business sector mentioned outset, would expect concerned. they’re
 thinking capital expenditures plans 2007 they’re fiscal year-end
 meetings, balance concern discussion hard landing may well affect
 ability bet big make big projects. So, again, share rather conservative view
 staff expressed Greenbook terms business investment going be.
 Finally, let talk moment inflation—again context
 market perspectives. tried witty David discussion, break
 occurred call section “Inflation: Objects Mirror Larger
 Appear?” [Laughter] That’s half-hearted effort humor. I’ve probably talked
 TIPS markets least much folks around table past six seven months,
 find comfort them. find increasingly viewing bit
 divorced data. view expectations inflation relevant price
 setting may deteriorated much substantially TIPS markets survey
 measures suggest. think Greenbook alternative simulation hits case well,
 conclusion expectations may account year’s rise core
 inflation either markets estimate. Inflation likely going particularly sticky
 labor markets, given discussion moment ago. low unemployment insurance
 claims, low unemployment, strong wage job growth make believe labor
 market may actually tightening time everything else we’ve talked
 happening housing markets. revision BLS suggested found 810,000
 jobs March. said done subsequent six-month period, may
 found jobs well, bolstering case labor markets may, fact, quite

 tight. Total compensation 8.3 percent, fastest rate since third quarter 2000.
 Average hourly earnings accelerated 4 percent. end day,
 take comfort TIPS spreads, reliance. think measure
 TIPS spreads indication inflation expectations, troubled, probably increasingly,
 TIPS markets appear following forecast rather actual data,
 continue address problem proactively markets. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d actually like start plea based
 something President Fisher said. I’d like treated like welder. get show-up

 MR. FISHER. we’ll waiting completion bonus. [Laughter]
 MR. KROSZNER. everyone said, relatively little information
 change people’s outlook fundamentally. sort tension we’ve
 before—slowing growth persistent inflation. Although see signs inflation
 coming down, still persisting higher level many people, including me, would like
 be. Despite slowing housing market, private domestic final purchases continue

 inflation down, even one believed gap important effect—and vanishing
 evidence important effect.
 there’s role expectations economic models—the multiple equilibriums
 story. markets’ belief inflation relatively low going forward affects
 price-setting behavior, affects willingness consumers pay goods

 multiple equilibriums situation, it’s clear exactly driving expectations. Obviously,
 part belief people around table, something incredibly
 important; it’s something really need maintain, something don’t

 left uncomfortable really understanding inflation situation, short-run
 inflation dynamics, output gap approach, energy shocks approach,

 MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. see it, data actually

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let summarize heard,

 several themes around table. Many people noted bimodal economy.
 Housing still quite weak, although number people noted thought lower tail
 trimmed somewhat. Autos undergoing inventory adjustment, people
 noted slowing sectors. However, general view spillovers
 housing rest economy yet occurred. people noted labor
 market quite healthy, widespread shortages labor, particularly skilled workers.
 noted consumption spending would supported job market, income
 growth, fall energy prices. Overall, assessments growth, heard them,

 declining, headline inflation fallen energy costs. felt core inflation
 would moderate gradually, others less confident that. behavior rents
 behavior productivity two important unknowns going forward, wage growth
 probably presents biggest upside risk inflation. members expressed concerns
 high level inflation could raise inflation expectations undermine Fed credibility.
 general view, think essentially everyone shares, upside risks inflation
 exceed downside risks growth juncture.
 hope summary okay; let make comments own.
 number people noted, intermeeting data actually fairly limited. employment
 report indicate fairly strong labor market. still, mind, disconnect
 anecdotes data; particular, wage data yet reflect I’m
 hearing around table wage premiums. example, average hourly earnings actually
 grew slowly third quarter second quarter. think ECI next week
 important check anecdotes. positive side, Kevin others noted,
 tone generally stronger financial markets. stock market up. note ten-year real
 rate 15 basis points since last meeting, take positive indication
 growth.
 Oil prices continue decline, obviously good growth inflation.
 thought might interested thinking quantity effects decline oil prices.
 We’ve decline oil prices $15, back-of-the-envelope calculations
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 73 203
 
 FRB/US analysis tell us add 0.45 percent level real consumption
 0.35 percent level real GDP. Dave Reifschneider helpful finding
 numbers. That’s change level, oil price declines could add 0.3
 0.4 percentage point growth, say, next six quarters. Another way look
 think relationship oil prices house prices. rule thumb might
 useful $3 decline oil prices offsets approximately 1 percentage point decline
 house prices terms overall consumption effects. oil price declines essentially
 negative equivalent 5 percent decline house prices. interesting question may
 address point is, policy implication oil price declines? think it’s
 clear oil price declines lower total core inflation, also increase growth.
 Therefore, policy response lower oil prices could depend preferences
 growth versus inflation also assessments risks variables.
 housing correction, agree perhaps reduction lower tail.
 it’s important point that, even see stabilization starts permits, lot
 inventory still there, there’s going inventory correction process could
 quite significant. current months’ supply homes sale greater 6 now,
 excluding cancellations; number past eight years stable around 4,
 although 1997 higher variable, source uncertainty. get
 sense magnitudes potential housing correction, asked Josh Gallin
 following simple simulation. Single-family housing sales 1.0 million annual
 rate July, 1.05 million August. asked Josh consider case sales
 flatten level 1.1 million continue level indefinitely; addition,
 homebuilders respond three-fourths increase sales extra building allow

 fourth go reducing inventory. calculation, find
 actually work inventory. end 2008, months’ supply 4.1. Part
 decrease occurs sales level higher, denominator bigger well.
 Thus particular scenario sensible one terms getting inventories down.
 However, effects GDP, correction still significant, trivial,
 also large. effect scenario GDP growth fourth quarter
 year second quarter next year 0.2 growth 0.1 third
 fourth quarters. substantial part housing correction still place
 need work inventories next quarters.
 comments real side. think tail risk
 reduced. agree Greenbook growth slow, least first
 quarter next year, housing corrections, consumption probably pick
 lead stronger growth path that.
 Let say words inflation. think need push back little view

 slow respond determinants, fact actually seen improvement
 sense positive surprise, negative surprise. attention that’s paid
 twelve-month lagging inflation measure problem context, four
 months 0.3 percent readings March June, they’re going stay twelvemonth lagging measure next March. predict great confidence next March
 next June twelve-month lagging inflation measure decline. think it’s
 useful, President Lacker, look, bit least, higher-frequency measures see
 trend movement is. Although, like President Lacker others, I’m happy level,
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 75 203
 
 think direction actually good. example, core CPI three-month went
 3.79 May 2.75 September, it’s decline 104 basis points. core PCE threemonth inflation measure went 2.95 May 2.20 September, using staff estimate
 core PCE deflator September. it’s certainly moving right direction.
 comment would make subject must keep mind
 much tied owners’ equivalent rent component. would say, fact,
 exclude that, do, comparison, 2006 roughly equivalent 2005 terms
 core PCE inflation. look high frequency numbers, excluding OER, I’m
 illustrative purposes, core CPI fell 3.01 May 2.23 September, core PCE
 inflation fell 2.52 May 1.93 September annual rate. saying
 significant part speedup decline rate related owners’
 equivalent rent phenomenon—not it, significant part. It’s important know
 because, we’ve discussed around table, OER may dynamic. may
 respond different ways monetary policy components do. imputed
 price, people actually observe, may different effect expectations
 than, say, gasoline prices easily observed prices. important aspect OER
 that, extent major source inflation problem, makes clear inflation
 probably wage-push problem far owners’ equivalent rent obviously
 cost buildings, cost labor. look inflation past months,
 slow improvement, far don’t think seen great deal
 feedthrough wage pressures inflation. I’ve looked various categories
 goods services whose prices increased, find particular relationship labor
 market factors.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 76 203
 
 Another comment along line: It’s also true inflation even 2.20 percent,
 core PCE three-month inflation rate September, high long run. agree
 lower that. ask ourselves, given inflation high
 that, people pointed out, high number years now, quickly
 bring down. optimal monetary policy models suggest slow reduction
 would try achieve start far away target real economy
 relatively weak. Now, question arises whether going right direction. think
 far are, would certainly agree ensure continue go right
 direction. Greenbook forecast predicated constant federal funds rate current
 level; actually rate declines 2008. leaves notion gathering
 information trying resolve uncertainty, depending things develop. Obviously,
 policy respond one direction another could, inflation continue
 decline, aggressive achieve that. felt needed talk bit fact
 improvement inflation, situation cannot really said
 deteriorating.
 said that, let come back agree I’ve heard,
 that, although yet seen much wage-push inflation, clearly risk there.
 Anecdotally, extent statistically, tight labor markets. surprising
 little wage push far, labor markets continue stay level
 tightness, one would expect would get inflation effect would
 uncomfortably persistent. real concern, share everyone around table.
 Phillips curve language doesn’t appeal you, another way thinking that,
 labor market stays tight, means growth potential better, real

 interest rate consistent growth rate needs higher now. agree
 point well. bottom line agree inflation greater risk, certainly.
 think downside risk output slightly reduced. also think upside risk
 inflation slightly reduced. Thus we’re different position
 last meeting. discuss implications tomorrow. think I’ll stop
 there. Yes, President Poole.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. questions Vince? President
 Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Vince, want ask charts 5 6 Bluebook. Also,
 want make comment ask question. Chart 5, equilibrium real federal funds rate
 chart, shows current fed funds rate slightly range models close
 output gap within twelve quarters. doesn’t really speak inflation tensions monetary
 policy. However, chart 6 deals directly inflation monetary policy,
 2 percent target 1½ percent target. Neither scenario achieves target 2012, though
 get closer 2 percent target were, fact, target. charts
 helpful us policymakers. comment recommend future Bluebooks
 include both, done time done sometimes

 helpful policymaking. question whether chart 5 chart 6 integrated
 closely understand implications chart 5 output gap inflation.
 MR. REINHART. You’re exactly right, that’s tried put closer
 together Bluebook. [Laughter]
 MR. MOSKOW. we’re making progress.
 MR. REINHART. We’re making progress—incremental, progress Federal
 Reserve is. [Laughter] notion equilibrium real rate is: held real rate
 constant next twelve quarters, output gap would close end period.
 doesn’t, however, mean would like inflation rate get end, twelve quarters

 October 25, 2006—Morning Session
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning. We’ve already heard Vincent’s report
 statement policy proposals, we’ll begin program morning policy
 go-round. that, we’ll discussion communications. We’ll adjourn point.
 stay lunch, short presentation planning Federal
 Reserve centennial, hope stay hear about. without ado,
 let’s begin second go-round, Debbie take names. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let start policy conclusion
 explain got there. First all, support holding federal funds rate current
 level 5¼, also support minimal change statement think much
 happened change put place going produce questions
 market meant it.
 also want say policy outlook going forward symmetrical around 5¼.
 may take people surprise, given generally characterized inflation hawk,
 want understand logic view. terms December meeting, would,
 given current information, put probability of, say, two-thirds want keep fed
 funds rate is, splitting evenly one-third down, depending data.
 look six months ahead, outlook remains symmetrical, probability
 current fed funds rate 5¼ might drop one-third split two-thirds either side.
 others around table agree outlook fed funds rate symmetrical
 views along lines, would hope minutes could report
 view guidance market matter could important terms way
 market treats incoming data.
 
 October 24-25, 2006

 view come from? need sharp distinction between, first,
 policy preferences, objective function, loss function; second, way economy
 works, current state economy; third, probabilities various possible economic
 outcomes, data looking forward. three concepts analytically distinct. regard
 first, asymmetric loss function. inflation failed slow or, worse yet,
 increased, would much higher long-run costs outcome GDP growth
 modestly potential. sense, loss function decidedly asymmetrical, saying
 must deal inflation fails slow or, worse, increases. note market
 expectations quite asymmetrical. policy conclusion comes combining situation
 market—the market structure way economy behaves—with loss function.
 economy symmetrical position, asymmetric loss function would lead
 asymmetric policy outlook funds rate. economy symmetrical situation
 quite long time, market expectations easier policy next year.
 Now, course, may change data come in, that’s see right now.
 Upside surprises data, combination stronger economic activity upside
 inflation surprises, could easily drive ten-year bond rate 50 basis points, would take
 current fed funds rate; 75 basis points might restore normal term premium.
 could even anticipate bond market might go good bit higher that.
 past fifty years, average spread ten-year rate fed funds rate
 90 basis points, there’s lots room ten-year rate go without
 anything. fact, got outcome data direction December,
 even January, I’m guessing that, ten-year rate went 75 basis points response
 incoming news, might loathe—depending nature news, course—to add
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 88 203
 
 raising fed funds rate, even though loss function, view, ought heavily
 tilted toward fighting inflation. combination asymmetric loss function
 economy asymmetric direction, believe, ought point symmetric
 outlook fed funds rate. incoming data substantially weaker currently
 expected ten-year rate decline 25 50 basis points now,
 process couldn’t go far unless market started develop view would
 policy easing future. is, market convinced going hang
 5¼, perhaps part keep insisting concern inflation market
 reads us policy bias toward tightening fed funds rate, would get
 full possible benefit market response weak data bringing longer-term rates.
 want happen got weak data going forward.
 That’s argument believe policy outlook fed funds rate ought
 symmetrical. I’m arguing change today; hope that’s clear. believe
 provide guidance market going forward that, event economy comes
 weak, we’re prepared cut rates. Conversely, emphasize that, strong
 data, particularly bad inflation news, won’t necessarily pull trigger right away. believe
 right guidance going forward. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Yes, two-handed intervention.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Bill, I’m sure quite way ask
 question, Committee adopted approach market’s response change
 signal lower expected funds rate path way interpret
 change signal, would consistent objectives you’re trying achieve?
 MR. POOLE. think so, yes.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. would leave forecast inflation
 you’d comfortable with?
 MR. POOLE. Right. view recent news inflation
 marginally better, tilted bit right direction. think that’s view
 Chairman expressed yesterday, certainly view. want
 market respond incoming data way would helpful policy enterprise
 we’re involved in. given outlook economy pretty symmetrical around
 Greenbook forecast, think give genuine weight possibility
 economy could come weaker. want rule tell market it’s
 going take really bad outcome economy us willing move.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. wasn’t trying talk view, [laughter]
 don’t policy rules, prism choices, tell that, alter weights
 loss function—
 MR. POOLE. No, no. loss function reflect fundamental beliefs
 objectives we’re trying accomplish. need keep loss function analytically
 distinct judgment way economy works stance economy.
 preferences ought blow wind.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. really question framework
 policy rules give us choice. way understood that, alter weights
 you’re asymmetric weights, policy rules, you’re talking forecast
 that’s sort basic central forecast underpinning rules, don’t get higher path?
 MR. POOLE. there’s distinction. wanted say weights

 weights different weights—not alter weights go along

 that.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
 MR. FISHER. listening Bill, consider us neither hawks sparrows

 come around Bill said, maybe different way. struck me, Mr. Chairman,
 reflected last night heard table yesterday, balance sustained barrage

 however, continuing hear availability cost labor, costs,

 inflationary expectations, whether expectations measured accurately
 TIPS spreads, personally doubt. One need look morning’s Financial
 Times editorial Bill Gross’s recent client letter—I’ve known Gross twenty years,
 know he’s oddball. Actually, I’d like word struck record. [Laughter]
 MR. MOSKOW. want substitute? [Laughter]
 MR. FISHER. He’s increasingly addled, words carry weight. recent
 client letter, says, “Inflation leveling admittedly unacceptable levels.” Hence
 careful reference word “comportment.” think first immediate statement,
 want come that.
 also think, way, one thing we’ll get afternoon, centennial.
 transcripts meetings released approach centennial, think
 make clear FOMC, like previous ones, extremely vigilant regard
 greatest threat society, inflation—at least economic society. need
 issue statement makes clear we’re mindful remain vigilant
 inflationary risk. Vince’s table, something B B+, laid yesterday
 afternoon, would trick. way, would tack “to upside” end first
 sentence right-hand column B—it’s sort mix B B+—because
 view inflationary risk upside. That’s asymmetry.
 want make one comment. Governor Warsh gave impressive briefing
 yesterday financial market’s perspective, we’ve heard others equity
 market’s robustness given us something cushion regard weakness housing.
 Although many table seem share staff’s estimation third-quarter growth—
 we’ll find Friday—and mind, HSBC securities house I’ve found
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 92 203
 
 analysis similar yours, careful stating views growth.
 comes around Bill’s statement, think, first rationale box alternative B,
 say economic growth appears slowed Q3. accept that.
 say “going forward”—implying going forward Q3—the economy seems likely expand
 moderate pace. saying “moderate” slow third quarter? That’s even
 staff seems saying. phraseology might spook equity markets,
 driven, way, think analyst would find out, top-line growth
 earnings, continued efficiencies cost goods sold, management cost
 goods sold inventories. Again, take comfort fact strong equities
 market. I’d like suggest replacing word “moderate” section 2 alternative B
 “improved.” think it’s small word change. “Going forward”—that’s going forward
 third quarter—“the economy seems likely expand improved pace.” That’s we’re
 saying, that’s staff saying, that’s we’re hearing around table, think
 say so. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. question Richard. said inflation risks tilted
 upside—I think said something like that—did mean believe incoming
 data likely show higher inflation, mean utility function policy
 objective function puts high weight inflation? think it’s important distinguish
 concepts.
 MR. FISHER. Like you, feel moderate still substantial
 inflationary impulses. I’m concerned expectations.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 93 203
 
 MR. POOLE. want pin think it’s important point.
 believe probability higher inflation come higher
 lower been?
 MR. FISHER. want answer question?
 MR. POOLE. I’m trying make question sharp. me, outlook
 inflation data we’re going see pretty symmetrical around been, maybe
 even tilted little downside.
 MR. FISHER. Yes, think we’ve moderation inflation; however, don’t
 think come level proud of.
 MR. POOLE. agree that.
 MR. FISHER. worry that, don’t get level proud
 of, feed expectations don’t backbone deal market
 expects us deal with, should, view, single purpose.
 MR. POOLE. rate would proud really way stating objective
 loss function. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support keeping rates unchanged
 alternative B. think rate, least now, seems consistent growth economy
 tad growth potential gradual decline inflation. Incoming data
 tell us we’re wrong that, right looks like best bet accomplish
 objectives think Committee ought accomplishing.
 agree pace extent disinflation great uncertainties here. President
 Poole made valuable contribution loss function relative policy path.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 94 203
 
 failure reverse earlier increase inflation main risk good economic performance
 face. Therefore, need see downward path inflation. think minutes
 speeches made pretty clear that’s Committee means inflation risks
 remaining. think public understands that.
 President Poole made valuable distinction loss function
 economic outlook implies interest rates, don’t agree conclusion.
 all, Greenbook forecast essentially flat federal funds rate very, gradual
 decline inflation barely along path Committee members could tolerate.
 loss function asymmetrical relative that, it’s likely interest rates would
 rise fall relative Greenbook path. Moreover, many members Committee
 seem stronger path output, maybe even inflation going forward,
 embedded Greenbook. wording additional firming may needed,
 asymmetrical wording risk assessment, appropriate representation
 Committee looking potential future path interest rates given loss function
 Committee’s outlook growth inflation.
 comments language. section 2, like addition
 forward-looking language and, unlike President Fisher, use “moderate.” seems
 word “moderate” fairly ambiguous, suggest don’t expect great
 deal weakness going forward great deal strength. think that’s
 Committee is—growth close to, maybe bit below, growth potential, word
 “moderate” conveys sense Committee wasn’t looking something really weak
 something really strong going forward. think valuable addition.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 95 203
 
 Like you, President Fisher, wonder specific reference third quarter
 would play out. Governor Kroszner actually brought attention
 Friday. advantage reference third quarter that, acknowledging weak
 third quarter, markets might react strongly print begins number 1
 would didn’t acknowledge that. also couple disadvantages. third
 quarter could come much closer 2½ percent. lot assumptions built
 number. could wrong. even important, perspective, awful lot
 weakness third quarter net exports inventory change. underlying feel
 third quarter final demand aren’t really different second quarter.
 emphasizing weakness third quarter language may give good sense
 think underlying situation was. Alternative language might general sentence
 saying “economic growth slowed course year, partly reflecting cooling
 housing market.” general sentence “over course year”
 probably reflects better Committee is. could live third-quarter language
 that’s now, would slight preference one.
 section 3, actually slight preference wording alternative A. I’ve
 always little uncomfortable relating outlook inflation level energy
 prices. last major increase energy prices last spring, think they’ve kind
 level since April May actually come down. commentary last
 announcement pointed contradiction energy prices pushing
 inflation pulling future. slight preference, again, would
 wording alternative A, says high level resource utilization potential
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 96 203
 
 sustain pressures. doesn’t reference high level prices energy
 commodities.
 section 4, risk assessment, looking language Vincent put table
 yesterday, think first sentence better job enunciating Committee
 thinking about—that reduction inflation we’re looking at. I’m
 hesitant change risk assessment language. think people understand mean
 risk assessment language now. concerned changing would provoke reaction,
 I’m confident know reaction would be. preference, again,
 stick current risk assessment language that’s alternative B. Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Could repeat change suggested, Don, section 2?
 MR. KOHN. Instead “economic growth appears slowed third
 quarter” would “economic growth slowed course year.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. glossary dictionary question. Like Don,
 interpreted “moderate,” advised staff so, “at slightly
 potential.” used phrase recent past way would allow reasonably
 informed outside person interpret way?
 MR. REINHART. don’t know.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We’ve used verb adjective. [Laughter]
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. euphemism “potential”? “solid”?
 “solid” conventional use?
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 97 203
 
 MR. REINHART. It’s sustainable solid. really hate say this. [Laughter]
 using “solid” “at potential,” seems symmetrical use
 “moderate” “at potential.”
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. consider merits Don’s change,
 Kroszner-Kohn change, second section, convey sense growth? look
 recent slowdown, growth strengthens relative pace second third
 quarters. “moderate” imply modest strengthening relative pace second
 third quarters?
 MR. REINHART. think issue whether “going forward” means starting
 quarter we’re currently whether statement 2007. reason drafted
 explicit reference third quarter we’re fourth quarter, least believe
 staff forecast, think GDP growth already bounced back third quarter.
 MR. FISHER. Moderately? [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. going say, too, complicated fact
 assessment potential written down. Even informed observer might
 caught nuance much we’ve written down. Looking would
 referred “moderate” “solid” context, numbers different two years ago
 now. creates even greater level possible confusion here. 2 percent
 good, bad, indifferent? depends think potential is, changed.
 complexity think speaks difficulty wording sentence.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 98 203
 
 MR. REINHART. would say, President Minehan, reference minutes
 past two meetings staff’s marking rate growth potential certainly
 caught attention market participants.
 MS. MINEHAN. think caught enough attention would still
 interpret fourth-quarter growth rate 2½ percent okay?
 MR. REINHART. think, actually, chart briefing showed
 nine primary dealers’ forecast real GDP tracking Greenbook forecast suggests
 may moved haven’t moved much staff.
 MS. MINEHAN. Okay.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Governor Kohn, concerning assessment risk, think heard
 say alternative B+ weren’t sure effect would have. I’m interested
 underlies uncertainty.
 MR. KOHN. Well, basic concern something already people
 seem understand. change it? view, current risk assessment well understood,
 thanks minutes. Things haven’t changed. everybody stressed discussions
 economy yesterday sense risk outlook, nothing changed.
 didn’t see reason change language.
 MR. LACKER. understand rationales retaining language, expressed
 uncertainty effect B+ was. struck me—and think intended Vince—
 adding dollop hawkishness statement. doubt markets would
 interpret way?
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 99 203
 
 MR. KOHN. think that’s quite possible. Given people haven’t changed
 views, I’m sure would necessarily want that.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. President Minehan.
 MS. MINEHAN. noted yesterday, I’ve become somewhat less worried
 downside risk baseline outlook. degree, factor changed little since
 last time. fact, think baseline isn’t bad all. Indeed, it’s testament, again,
 resilience U.S. economy actually pull off, seem doing, gradual
 slowing powerful U.S. housing markets background considerable
 geopolitical energy market uncertainty price pressures, mention potential
 strong consumer retrenchment financial market volatility.
 seem threading line lot risks sides baseline,
 seem successfully negotiating soft landing. think take
 pride far good monetary policy played key role
 unwinding process. regard, continue believe cost central bank
 wrong inflation risks greater wrong side growth time. growth
 wanes expected, ease policy fairly quickly. Getting behind curve
 inflation could good deal costly. Thus, pretty comfortable current
 stance policy, see slightly restrictive. least time being, think balances
 risk wrong inflation risk slower growth appropriate given
 brighter tone much incoming data, possible exception residential investment.
 risk-management argument could made raising rates, certainly less
 comfortable current prospective levels core inflation might find action
 attractive. don’t, continue worry downside risks growth,
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 100 203
 
 less comfortable forecast that, change policy near term, inflation
 gradually fall 2 percent measured core PCE next eighteen months
 so. projection, least time, seems right. come side keeping
 fed funds rate 5¼. that’s policy choice.
 next issue say it. think it’s important continue emphasize
 concern regarding inflation rather move balance risks. Financial
 markets remain quite accommodative, really see reason encourage
 so, thinking policy easing might occur sooner now. think would
 outcome alternative A. I’d prefer alternative B.
 next question is, alternative B? seem B-, B+, B. Let
 comment bit variety alternatives raised. know, lot
 regard Governor Kohn, take point—and Governor Kroszner’s point—about
 section 2. However, reading myself, think reference third
 quarter might help markets react better if, fact, Greenbook forecast accurate
 number we’re going see Friday, considerably less lot
 people market think we’re going see. thought reference third quarter
 helpful there. But, again, great deal regard cumulative wisdom
 side that.
 regard section 3, I, too, believe benefit making change
 that’s suggested Bluebook using alternative wording section 3. shorter
 wording reflect moderation occurred energy commodity prices,
 puts level resource utilization front center inflation risk. also find it’s
 somewhat shorter, which, general, think desirable.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 101 203
 
 section 4, found B+ wording attractive suggests concern regarding
 inflation heard around table yesterday somewhat diminution deep concern
 downside risks. way, think benefit margin getting away
 stock phrases. take Governor Kohn’s point seriously one recognizing
 there’s potential unknowable consequences. marginally favor B+,
 happy go alternative B, either it’s presented, switch
 section 3, new language section 2. I’m easy, might say. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. lot interesting
 discussion far go-round, find views refining bit go along.
 bottom line today certainly agree everyone spoken far maintain
 funds rate 5¼ percent appropriate action. incoming data received
 period really changed outlook much economy. course,
 little optimistic people last time, I’m glad see everybody
 come around point view. [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. Beginner’s luck.
 MR. PLOSSER. That’s right. [Laughter] Well, you’ve got take can,
 right? Inflation continues higher I’d like see, still believe larger risks
 inflation side growth side. Growth slower third quarter—we
 acknowledged that. also discussed around table fact even
 Greenbook predicting somewhat larger bounceback fourth quarter; indeed,
 remain optimistic general bounceback going somewhat quicker
 Greenbook’s forecast. We’ve good news inflation: seems stabilized
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 102 203
 
 somewhat. given earlier pause, extending pause seems prudent thing
 perspective. growth forecast Greenbook next several quarters remains
 significantly trend, actually holding rates steady would implicit firming
 policy, may desirable effects inflation might need order
 bring inflation. However, growth bounces back strongly Greenbook
 forecasts, believe likely outcome, may consider additional increases
 fed funds rate going forward. Thus, standpoint, really don’t view prospective
 policy path particularly symmetric. believe path likely would hold
 fixed allow weakening economy somewhat firm policy inflation work
 way; growth responds quickly, may, fact, engage firming
 policy.
 regards language, I’m little torn. I’m bit President Minehan. kind
 like B, kind like B+, also worry bit language implications
 market. actually find agreement Governor Kohn many points.
 like prospective change section 2, getting away think somewhat unusual
 factors third quarter emphasizing quarter much. course, might
 leaving section 2 almost last time. difference you’re
 making statement going forward economy seems likely expand moderate pace.
 first sentence section 2 last statement, sentence section 2, really
 conveys almost thing think Governor Kohn trying achieve, I’m
 certainly happy section 2 suggested Governor Kohn.
 believe it’s clearly premature send signal whatsoever rate cut
 contemplated near term, think language alternative A, section 4,
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 103 203
 
 would read. think change risk assessment language would lead market
 participants lower expected path fed funds rate would opinion
 counterproductive. also think mentioning possibility slowdown economic
 growth become pronounced, section 2 alternative seems suggest,
 would misleading would inconsistent, noted,
 optimism expressed around table yesterday. Thus Friday, advance estimate
 third quarter released, language would read expecting growth less
 1 percent going forward, think that’s really forecasts suggesting.
 believe greater likelihood growth higher rather lower coming
 months Greenbook shows; unless see evidence economic growth
 weakening significantly compared forecast, lowering fed funds rate
 likely outcome. think reluctant suggest statement
 inclined lower rates. reasons, really don’t favor language alternative
 A. Relative alternative B, language B+, suggested, accurately reflects
 view many us around table have—that data seen actually truncated
 tail downside risk really bad outcome somewhat
 diminished past weeks. I’m afraid trying use B+ fine-tune
 expectations precisely may create problems solves. tend favor keeping
 language constant can. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 recent monthly pattern core inflation, encouraging, firmly establish downward
 trajectory, think important establish. Consequently, would prepared leave
 fed funds rate level naturally firm mentioned others, would
 support additional tightening inflation reverse course.
 Let briefly talk statement. downside risks growth remain,
 would want convey markets impression near-term easing policy likely

 best accomplish updating rationale section using wording suggested

 Thank you.

 MR. HOENIG. Yes.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you.
 MR. KOHN. said didn’t like word “moderate”?
 MR. HOENIG. No, said comfortable word “moderate.”
 MR. KOHN. Oh, comfortable it. I’m sorry.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. noted yesterday, I’m comfortable
 last meeting economic growth deteriorate significantly, continue
 believe risk inflation remain higher personally desire still there.
 today support change fed funds rate, support language alternative B.
 However, listening comments around table today, like Governor Kohn’s
 suggestion section 2. reasons stated, think suggestion makes little
 clearer way it’s stated now. also going suggest section 3 use
 language alternative A, Governor Kohn suggested. others said, prefer
 leave assessment-of-risk language unchanged I’m sure much changed since
 last meeting. Bluebook notes could use B+ language protest view
 markets greater likelihood we’re going easing rather tightening.
 I’m sure going view protest, prefer use minutes speeches
 fully communicate sentiment. reasons I’m comfortable assessmentof-risk language alternative B. It’s becoming clearer discussion
 round becoming important issues we’re confronting level inflation

 find acceptable, fast going get there, intend get there. I’m
 looking forward discussion go-round. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support keeping rates unchanged.
 wording, guess lean slightly toward B+ B, it’s matter feel strongly about,
 could certainly accept either alternative. remain quite uncertain various forces
 economy going play out. said economic go-round, think that, maintain
 current stance policy, likely get desirable features soft landing
 inflation coming gradually. think substantial risks output growth.
 guess they’re balanced around moderate growth, remain concerned downside
 would include period sustained significant weakness. inflation front, think
 risks remain tilted direction higher inflation I’m uncertain
 inflation process working because, believe inflation come down, don’t
 confidence scenario underlying it. don’t get play-out downside housing risks,
 think probability growth actually sufficiently strong we’ll get
 upward pressure inflation labor market. We’re going learn lot December. lot
 data coming bear growth, inflation pressures, labor market, forth.
 clearly makes sense wait.
 guess I’m slightly attracted B+ B think language clearly
 suggests upward bias future rate changes reflect view risks
 inflation likely path policy. minimum, seems push back bit
 market’s view we’re going unwinding rather quickly. take arguments
 made around table B opposed B+. I’m sure really much
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 107 203
 
 gained changing language place this, leaving alone may wiser
 course end day. section 2, think Governor Kohn made good argument
 changing language. Again, could go either way. Finally, section 3, prefer wording
 alternative alternative B. Referring high level prices energy
 commodities, given we’ve substantial decline energy prices, really seem bit
 date bit touch.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. First Vice President Barron.
 MR. BARRON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. bottom line I’m comfortable
 current policy stance see need move become convinced forecast
 inflation moderation won’t realized. wording, I’m supportive alternative B
 currently provided Bluebook. I’m attracted Governor Kohn’s suggested change,
 given five weeks likely pull-back third quarter,
 would inclined leave wording currently written. would cautious
 changing wording—again, given short duration last meeting meeting
 given lack evidence lot things changed dramatically.
 reasons, think clear evidence output slowing, sense
 there’s uncertainty regard degree slowdown—that is, slow grow.
 Despite output uncertainty, businesses consumers seem reasonably comfortable
 prospects. Employment gains remain positive, albeit slower pace, income spending
 continue grow. are, however, real-side concerns housing sector, yet none
 scenarios we’ve run seem suggest anything approaching recession-level slowdown. Concerns
 remain weighted toward upside risk inflation, necessarily one demands immediate
 action. Despite concerns inflation front, think afford wait bit longer
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 108 203
 
 assess actual outcomes regarding inflation output, see match
 forecast, determine whether current level federal funds rate provides enough
 restraint reduce inflation. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Given decision pause couple
 meetings ago, don’t think move rates today. We’ve made small changes
 outlook since last meeting, we’re still facing uncertain policy environment. I’m feeling
 bit comfortable resilience real economy, mentioned. Still, recognize
 could reasonably clear picture correction housing
 markets playing out. regard inflation, it’s true past three months price data
 better previous three, pretty much consensus here, it’s still way soon
 point say core inflation peaked. basic thinking inflation changed:
 It’s high, see significant risk come fast enough. want refer
 back also medium-run scenarios Bluebook. Remember two targets,
 1½ percent target 2 percent target. recall that, depending target chose,
 different series policy actions early next year. think discussion
 communications later today relevance near-term policy decisions well
 longer-term communication strategy.
 terms language, let go section section. section 2, like
 change Kohn suggested, saying economic growth slowed course
 year instead referring specifically third quarter. There’s major benefit singling
 third quarter. substitute sentence accomplishes much thing pointing
 third quarter does, like change. second sentence section 2
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 109 203
 
 questions word “moderate” means, see confusion here.
 Coming meeting, thought “moderate” meant “below potential” “at potential”
 “moderate” means good great. That’s way interpreted it, would assume
 market observers Fed observers going exactly Vice Chairman
 Geithner did—
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Professor.
 MR. MOSKOW. Professor. [Laughter] Professor Geithner did, saying, “what’s
 dictionary say?” They’re going rushing dictionary figure “moderate” really
 means here. there’s confusion definition. there’s confusion pointed
 baseline is—from where; third quarter; average first
 three quarters? think valid critiques. think say thing word
 “improved,” though don’t think helps us. guess I’m happy sentence, can’t
 think better way improve point except drop completely. section 3—I agree
 alternative better alternative B, take reference energy first
 sentence. section 4, like language B+, it’s close call whether
 time make change. guess slight preference leaving way now.
 don’t think time make changes section 4, we’ll certainly another
 chance revisit next meeting.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
 MR. PLOSSER. There’s discussion word “moderate.” occurs
 arises also contexts. really speak code words? mean
 “moderate” believe growth near trend near potential going forward, don’t
 say that? It’s suggestion.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 110 203
 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. would break many years tradition. [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. say “slightly” “somewhat moderate.”
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That’s okay, President Plosser. You’re new. [Laughter]
 MR. PLOSSER. I’m bit slow learner, I’ll catch on.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. see two-handed intervention President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. speaking, started write exactly, “Couldn’t say
 economy seems likely expand pace slightly potential?” That’s we’re
 saying mean. say it?
 MR. HOENIG. long don’t get sidetracked onto “potential” point.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. don’t say, “Whatever is”? [Laughter]
 MS. MINEHAN. fill blank.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good suggestion.
 MR. MISHKIN. going come later. real issues using word
 “potential” think get us trouble. I’m sympathetic view clear,
 think better wait this. It’s something that’s complicated think want
 deal stage.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. right. President Stern.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First all, support maintaining federal
 funds rate 5¼ percent. Second, concerns editing fly. I’m sure
 leads effective communication, since that’s game we’re playing, [laughter] enter
 it, albeit little reluctantly. regard using alternative B framework, section 2,
 favor Kohn-Kroszner change mainly think puts little less emphasis highfrequency data and, things equal, less emphasis better. section 3,
 
 October 24-25, 2006

 think expression alternative preferable alternative B reasons
 President Yellen identified. seems touch continue talk high energy prices. Yes,
 they’re high relative history, they’re high relative past ten twelve months.
 might like say something artful resource utilization, think that’s battle
 another day, I’ll avoid that. far section 4 concerned, like others, find close
 call. may view policy, leans slightly toward B+, don’t know
 much gain making change time. don’t want today, might
 want think longer term. Making more-frequent language changes may
 advantages may mean change carries less weight it. seem
 gotten position it’s hard change even adverb adjective
 without worrying lot people financial markets going make it. I’d like
 find way position, one logical way it, think, make changes
 frequently make clear it’s way we’re going operate future
 particular words don’t carry excessive amount significance. don’t want today,
 also would favor B+; it’s something think need think about. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think communications subcommittee take
 advisement. [Laughter]
 MR. STERN. Good idea. [Laughter]
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Bies.
 MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, support leaving fed funds rate unchanged
 meeting. I’ve puzzled section 2, like Governor Kohn suggested
 one challenges whole thing heard around table yesterday,
 general supports conclusion I’ve coming to. really going rapid
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 112 203
 
 growth slowing, parse pieces, what’s really changing housing. rapid
 growth 2003 2005 due unsustainable housing construction; it’s coming down,
 it’s big chunk change. Now, sectors noise weak. Sectors like autos
 exports jumping around, it’s housing adjust. think it’s going run trend
 Greenbook says. time, mentioning yesterday, tightness
 labor market, signals sectors economy it’s hard find people
 available work sustain economy. It’s almost though dichotomy right
 whereby housing running trend rest economy running
 potential. think it’s important leave comment housing sector—that
 we’re focusing on. bringing aggregate number potential moderating
 growth rate. terms way go section 2, go either way. like
 change Governor Kohn suggested section 3. think good change. believe
 change section 4, assessment risk, meeting. five weeks.
 We’ve discussion changing frequently; again, think ought leave
 communications subcommittee think about. think ought leave
 says really mean. first sentence says inflation risks, that’s sense
 need convey. much could read change may unintended, I’d
 rather meeting leave way previous meeting. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Many us said inflation high. Many us said
 recently public, haven’t heard us say we’re satisfied inflation
 2¼ percent indefinitely. public expectations clearly seem inconsistent core inflation

 concerns inflation, effort fallen short. intended August decision
 hawkish pause, think it’s fair say markets overlooked hawkish part. Markets
 subsequently came believe set rate cuts store early next year. recent weeks
 policy path moved bit, don’t see evidence people expect us bring core
 inflation 2 percent anytime soon. think communicating collectively
 explicitly intentions would surely help situation. We’re going discuss later
 today, meantime, make policy old-fashioned way, based

 assessment meeting, last two meetings,
 tightening needed help ensure core inflation declines acceptable rate coming
 quarters real economy withstand increase fed funds rate. Discussion
 staff yesterday made quite clear that, view, inflation come

 concur.
 Now, reflecting results last two meetings discussion I’ve heard far,
 sense there’s decent probability I’m going outvoted today. [Laughter]
 understand respect arguments pausing now. housing slowdown weakening

 supporting alternative B, it’s hard see market policy

 Inflation evolving bit expected. talking temporary factors versus

 Inflation seems evolve slowly, little seems affect it. Part seems be,
 look data, energy price run-up appears pushed much inflation,
 don’t think rely energy price decline give us much benefit terms core. Recent

 ago. think it’s appropriate position given discussions. leaves us lot flexibility
 respond either surprisingly strong growth, surprisingly strong inflation numbers,
 surprisingly weak housing. think market expectations reasonably good position

 economy likely coming back, perhaps robust pace we’ve seen past
 reasonable moderate pace.
 Given energy prices commodity prices come down, taking
 energy prices commodity prices pushing inflation seem sustaining inflation
 pressures. Also given seen much change data made much

 particularly markets seem interpreting assessments roughly think
 reasonable considering risks going forward. markets interpreting things

 reason now.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
 MR. WARSH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. support keeping federal funds target
 constant. Let enter fray language stating opinion change
 language think markets understand views. shouldn’t change language
 market disagrees views. regarding distinction B B+,
 think minutes speeches many given since last
 meeting, markets hear we’re saying inflation; simply don’t agree it.
 feel comfortable that. is, told inflation top concern.
 smart, it’s not, judgment, essential somehow match markets’
 expectations own. obligation tell really think, frankly, quite
 helpful coming independent view. without going distinction
 B B+ whether change language, don’t see compelling reason, light
 understanding are, changing somewhat hawkish
 description B+. I’ve said before, language attempt rewrite
 could done better could done differently last time. view of, given
 are, incremental benefit change is. Thus favor relatively strongly making
 change B+ language Vincent forwarded yesterday. markets focused
 growth, talked yesterday. suggestion made alternative A, section 3,
 language perfectly appropriate, think reconciled shared everyone here.
 let go alternative B, section 2, language try make views clear terms
 changes suggested. First, instead describing economic growth third
 quarter refer economic growth course year, concern markets
 see gets posted third-quarter number think think growth
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 118 203
 
 going continue weak fourth quarter. even though don’t like pinpointing
 particular time, get little uncomfortable use first sentence say economic growth
 slowed present, is, 1 percent number gets posted Friday, let’s say,
 read say Committee believes trend fourth quarter.
 couple sentence next, say “going forward.” think “going forward”
 largely means 2007 we’ve opined first sentence third fourth quarters.
 think general view “going forward” sentence relate 2007
 left misunderstanding collectively fourth-quarter GDP,
 markets aren’t going right. would leave language first sentence
 referring third quarter. Sharing view many “moderate” clear
 we’d like, think want first sentence end third quarter next
 sentence talking, effect, fourth quarter beyond. can’t come
 better word “moderate,” would suggest following: “Going forward, economy
 seems poised expand moderate pace.” Again, I’m trying suggest optimism,
 inflection point there. language I’ve messed around would “poised return
 moderate pace” something else along line. think we’re trying show
 inflection point, would modest suggestion that. all, markets going
 focused growth statement. even though we’ve spent lot time
 wordsmithing, think quite important. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin.
 MR. MISHKIN. see data come past five weeks indicating
 economy actually evolving way find quite attractive. sense hate use

 [Laughter] regard, terms statement, want modify words possible.
 Clearly makes sense mention energy reasons discussed, think
 right way let markets know basically we’ve paused last couple
 meetings, pausing actually worked quite well, we’ll wait see data
 evolve. Thank you.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. am, think center gravity Committee is,
 somewhat uncomfortable amount moderation Greenbook expects see core
 PCE inflation, I’m somewhat uncomfortable view that, markets’ expectations
 fed funds rate, we’re going see enough moderation inflation. can’t
 confident—even fed funds rate stays constant, Greenbook suggests, next
 quarters—that get right amount moderation. think range plausible
 outcomes monetary policy likely path that’s priced markets, maybe
 somewhat assumption underpins Greenbook. I’m confident
 effectively alter expectations calibrate signal way engineer kind
 desirable change two three quarters expected path fed funds rate. don’t think
 there’s good case moving policy today, course. think first sentence C sort
 meant August, used then, I’d favor using today. don’t think
 there’s strong case putting today grounds don’t know that, basis
 evidence we’ve seen past five weeks, justify would interpreted

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vincent.
 MR. REINHART. says 18 people can’t draft statement? [Laughter]
 late breaking news. go dictionary, first meaning “moderate” “being within
 reasonable limits,” believe Governor Kohn referring to. also means “of
 limited average quality,” federal statistics, term art, “moderate income,”

 recommendation. worried numerator/denominator relationship. reference

 “moderate” defined clarified Vince keys third quarter, I’m concerned. If,
 however, take phraseology Governor Kohn suggested, think would acceptable.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Well, thank much useful,
 informative discussion. bottom line great deal information
 past five weeks base sharp change either policy statement. Therefore,
 would propose make change federal funds rate target today.
 Many issues raised yesterday sense prospective.
 housing market decline stabilize? labor markets strengthen weaken? growth
 slow return potential? next six seven weeks, next meeting, we’ll
 seeing employment cost index, third-quarter GDP, two employment reports, raft
 data housing prices key indicators. think would sensible think hard
 December whether course adjustment necessitated terms policy terms
 statement.
 would say Governor Warsh’s comment markets one I’ve
 thought myself. markets disagree you, try persuade not? think
 ideal thing is, again, convey strongly views are—in particular, objective
 function outlook—but general try directly influence position yield
 curve makes us lose important source information economy.
 However, intermeeting period continue verbal tightening sense
 emphasize ongoing concern inflation pace change inflation,
 convey, believe this, risks lower growth seem least
 somewhat moderated.

 respect language, I’ve trying keep track here, [laughter] think
 clear majority third section strike “and prices energy

 Governor Warsh raised issues thought trying distinguish third

 anyone would like re-enter discussion hearing whole thing? not, take

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. comment? Yes, Governor Kroszner.
 MR. KROSZNER. certainly something supportive of,
 mentioned, concerned, Governor Warsh others were, interpretation. Would
 make sense use word “poised” rather “likely,” think would mistake?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. think “poised” suggests future even
 already have. Frankly, may may occur, think second sentence, “seems
 likely expand moderate pace,” actually fairly hawkish sentiment tell
 markets less concerned meltdown housing many people bond
 market appear be. guess don’t see advantage “poised.” think “moderate,” even
 without Vince’s appropriate intervention, convey sense reasonable, near trend,
 certainly greater 1 percent. think it’s reasonable suggestion. will, course,
 talking subsequent sessions much want go forecasts much
 explicit want things future, point significant

 risk assessment, section 4, people expressed interest B+, think
 overwhelming sentiment changes case would somewhat risky, status

 quo seems majority. Again, interesting intermeeting period. We’ll see
 data are, we’ll also see markets respond data. President Poole
 pointed out, data exceptionally strong, think markets anticipate action
 begin move financial conditions appropriate direction. that’s recommendation.
 Would anyone like comment? not, Ms. Danker, could call roll?
 MS. DANKER. I’ll reading directive wording risk assessment alternative

 “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary financial conditions

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. meeting come order. portion meeting
 devoted discussion communications. Governor Kohn, could lead us off?
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like say words way
 introduction expectations today process going forward. Today we’re
 approaching general topic communications, also think everyone agrees today’s
 discussion, particular, communications. It’s regime, run
 policy, extent. get that.
 We’ve approaching topic gradual, deliberate way. issues
 important, don’t think there’s rush. There’s nothing we’re
 severely broken fix short run. want consider issues,
 discussed past meetings, number fronts, areas may
 changing—the numerical specification price stability, forecast, announcement,
 minutes—are interrelated. want end program across things makes
 sense, coherent, reinforces itself, balances various considerations talked
 last meeting principles guide things. need look individual
 pieces whole package, make sure understand implications, prepare
 public possibly Congress changes might make. see process
 deliberate typical Federal Reserve style, think justified case. One thing
 we’ve discovered communication policy that, make changes, really hard
 take back. need get clear among doing, it,
 implications deliberations, communication public,
 material might get staff meetings.

 today, issue table numerical specification price stability. Vincent

 many discussed last meeting.
 center gravity Committee today leaning toward going forward
 numerical specification price stability, would expect come back Committee
 subsequent two-day meeting March specifics would go
 choices would have. We’ll probably need staff analysis back up. lot
 analysis year half ago almost two years ago, I’m sure need
 pieces back up. bottom line we’re trying get sense
 Committee going. deliberate deliberative process take number months,
 quarters, get place we’re comfortable.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, Governor Kohn. Let add couple
 comments. I’ll talk substantively end round, want say I’m
 looking forward discussion. think we’re going learn lot. objective
 find package measures improve communication policy effectiveness,
 hope also find something attract broad support consensus around
 table really need whole Committee behind kind thing,
 possible.
 know focus today explicit specification numerical definition price stability.
 Certainly case, I’m sure many cases, interest depends lot
 interactions elements package—for example, projections. that’s important
 you, hope you’ll refer think we’ll proceed
 elements well.
 Let conclude reiterating point Governor Kohn made,
 making decisions today. ask please give impression outside world
 made decisions process going extended gradual want
 make sure pieces whatever decide coherent we’re
 comfortable plan. that, simply ask people raise hand they’d like
 speak, we’ll go around table.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, may ask one clarifying question?
 someone remind us minutes going characterize conversation
 next several meetings? going standard section like one used last time,
 pretty much without content? [Laughter]
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 127 203
 
 MR. REINHART. Since you’re likely making decisions, there’s
 much convey minutes full frank exchange views [laughter]
 regarding attitudes toward articulating price objective.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good. we’ll proceed understanding. President
 Lacker.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Vince Reinhart good job organizing
 issues three fundamental questions, I’d reverse order. last three
 questions asks whether adopting numerical objective would constrain influence subsequent
 policymaking. think start asking question constraints want impose
 work backward kind inflation target would provide constraints
 view useful. words, discretion want convince people use,
 put yet another way, monetary policies want rule ourselves? It’s fairly
 self-evident giving least monetary policy discretion useful, fact we’ve done
 this. all, success bringing inflation Chairmen Volcker Greenspan
 achieved giving discretion follow pre-1980 style policies trend inflation
 drifted upward giving discretion respond forcefully enough inflation scares.
 Regarding explicit inflation objective, let start considering expected
 value one-year inflation beginning n years ahead, n is, say, ten years more.
 number taken represent expected long-run inflation, make anything
 like—take kind postulate. don’t know economic reason expected one-year
 inflation beginning ten years vary materially time. fact, fluctuations
 expected long-run inflation impede effectiveness financial markets reduce economic
 welfare. Moreover, matter public accountability constitutional democracy, owe
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 128 203
 
 citizens United States tell simple yet important implication
 conduct monetary policy, make use retirement-planning software easier.
 [Laughter] presume we’ll able agree want give discretion pursue
 monetary policies expected long-run inflation varies time. Ultimately need
 choose number measured inflation rate corresponds price stability.
 Beyond choosing specific number, however, think challenging choice comes
 talk time periods. time period say intend
 inflation return average long-run objective? words, fast
 convergence take place? question critical substantive, it’s going require careful
 analysis consideration. one hand, time frame short. Obviously,
 saying inflation return target next month would us giving much
 discretion. hand, setting long time frame enough stabilize inflation
 expectations. Moreover, longer time frame set returning inflation target,
 harder it’s going public verify adherence announced target and, thus,
 longer may take us establish credibility announced intentions.
 approach I’ve outlined starting back inverting Vince’s question 3
 implication Vince’s question 2: FOMC choose inflation objective?
 general, since economic benefits numerical objectives stem reducing unnecessary
 uncertainty, maximize benefits make choice objective permanent
 less subject reconsideration future selves. suggests making numerical objective
 close possible once-and-for-all choice decision, example, inflation target
 explicitly voted Committee adopted reconsidered annually. Related
 that, explicit Committee decision, seems me, would preferable amalgamating
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 129 203
 
 members’ forecasts preferences relatively opaque Humphrey-Hawkins process.
 latter would potential generating objectives vary time Committee
 membership.
 Let briefly make observations think related this. First,
 initially announce adoption inflation objective, assuming that’s do,
 need act speak way that’s consistent announcement. That’s sort obvious,
 announcement going convey instant credibility. essential
 follow through. Second, announcement doubt convey general sense
 mean conducting monetary policy, actually make monetary policy immediately
 following announcement going demonstrate people think means—in
 words, it’s going constrain us practice. think adopting inflation
 objective consisting two sets things—an initial statement way subsequently act
 communicate—and think discuss both. Third, I’m camp believes
 adopting explicit inflation objective could improve interactions staff
 Committee providing guidance analysis useful us. example, staff
 might routinely report alternative simulations less aggressive approaches returning
 inflation target time, Bluebook. Finally, regarding question whether
 unilateral adoption consistent legislative framework, privy private
 conversations last November, Mr. Chairman, nomination hearings appeared provide
 Congress opportunity object, inclined, unilateral adoption
 inflation target Federal Open Market Committee. take fact so,
 least publicly, evidence would view numerical inflation objective broadly
 consistent wide latitude accorded us existing legislative mandate.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 130 203
 
 recognize cite so-called dual mandate reason question whether
 adopt inflation target without more-formal mandate Congress. past
 made great deal effort communicate; educate public relationship
 inflation output, two three mandates enter here; convince
 people contribute best keeping output growing maximal rate keeping inflation low
 stable. Moreover, make average inflation rate, long-run expected inflation, anything
 want. doesn’t hold employment growth output growth unemployment rate.
 remarks, Mr. Chairman.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, President Lacker. President Moskow.
 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s probably best state outset
 prefer different approach quantitative inflation guidelines, approach actually touched
 Vince’s second question. approach would prefer extending economic forecast
 horizon. I’ll address consideration first fill details requested Vince
 subcommittee, hope would consider option going forward.
 Moving explicit numerical specification price stability would big step
 Federal Reserve, Committee. that, said, there’s turning back.
 decision extremely important Committee. date, we’ve faced major
 decisions type, taken incremental approach, think approach served
 us well. example, increased transparency step step past twelve years,
 think approach really quite successful.
 I’m attracted intermediate step extending economic forecast horizons.
 think would natural extension already do, would give us experience
 many aspects quantitative inflation regime. preference would extend
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 131 203
 
 economic forecast horizon least five years ahead. five years out, inflation
 forecast close implicit inflation guideline. Output growth unemployment
 rate move around regard structural changes, like demographic changes total
 factor productivity growth, example.
 realize many details would addressed extend forecast horizon,
 figuring getting experience approach would help us learn what’s involved
 moving toward explicit numerical objective learn go far. First,
 policy assumption underlying forecast? Second, currently report GDP growth,
 unemployment rate, core inflation—so many variables would report? Third,
 continue current approach using central tendency develop integrated consensus
 forecast? Fourth, convey uncertainty bands around forecast longer horizons?
 realize questions difficult us answer Committee,
 tough challenges moving explicit specification price stability. biggest issue
 dual mandate responsibility relationship Congress. Clearly, persuasive case
 must made continue fulfill dual mandate responsibilities. challenge
 make explicit numerical specification price stability operationally compliant
 dual mandate, so, need clarify flexibility time period bringing inflation
 back target, Jeff talked about. amount time would depend size
 current inflation deviation deviations maximum sustainable growth
 employment. think intermediate step explaining longer-term forecasts would help us
 learn communicate difficult dual mandate issues effectively.
 Let cycle back questions Vince’s memo. regard first question,
 think clarification price stability objective would helpful extending
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 132 203
 
 forecast horizon good first step. Providing information long-term inflation goals
 help us maintain even reduce currently low inflation risk premiums long-term
 nominal financial contracts interest rates. inflation premiums risk compensation
 economic outcomes lot say about. long-term inflation information
 greatly facilitate communication within Committee externally. expressed
 views explicit inflation objectives previously. summarize, economic theory
 sharply pin optimum inflation rate, preference range 1 2 percent core
 PCE inflation. preference core inflation 1½ percent, center zone.
 inflation outside zone, policy broadly designed move inflation back
 center zone. However, time frame core inflation return center zone
 depends number factors, like dual mandate mentioned earlier.
 Finally, important issue discuss whether use core inflation
 headline inflation. central banks use headline inflation, seem manage well.
 I’m open discussion this, think communication issues complicated
 headline inflation deviates much transitory reasons core inflation.
 conclude, favor taking intermediate step extending forecast horizon five years, I’d
 like leave open question whether establish quantitative guidelines get
 experience approach.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Poole.
 MR. POOLE. Thank you. want associate comments President Lacker
 offered. going this, ought make clean explicit. would favor
 approach President Moskow offered calling target forecast leaves much
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 133 203
 
 room change time. think central idea target long-term
 commitment something ought change new FOMC comes in.
 believe coherent policy FOMC requires Committee least act
 though inflation target. can’t coherent discussion Charlie Plosser
 favoring zero percent people favoring 2 percent. often said would
 like zero properly measured, think far important reasonable, low range
 say exactly number is. think ought able that.
 said target range understood permanent unless developments
 literature theory suggest needs recalibrated. matter governance,
 incoming FOMC going reaffirm range, think would understood
 would change without substantial analysis communication general
 public. fact, constraint would communication general public would
 produce very, high hurdle even discussing change. think would appropriate
 discussing change inside springing general public would reflect
 good monetary policy.
 also believe there’s good reason adopt inflation range sooner rather later.
 realize need deliberate process here, would argue sooner, first all,
 new Chairman views academic well known subject
 discussing time. Also, opportunity—whether
 would successful don’t know shouldn’t pass by—to help deal current
 inflation environment. true that, take staff model arbitrarily dial
 inflation expectations embedded Phillips curve, get nice result. Generally,
 way simulations go, inflation expectations term grinds away time,

 MR. STERN. good times over? [Laughter]
 MR. MISHKIN. many know, thought quite lot issue

 different political environments structures committees operate. finished

 Federal Reserve, reflect thinking may little bit different
 seen before.
 Let go decision tree, thought excellent. Committee
 staff superb job framing way find useful, going proceed exactly
 along lines suggest. first question is, explicit numerical specification price
 stability helpful? going surprised answer: It’s strong “yes.” could
 go written much it, I’ll try brief
 issues. key successful monetary policy strong nominal anchor. kind
 success we’ve seen central banks throughout world, would predicted
 ten fifteen years ago, really remarkable, strong nominal anchor
 allows markets lot work you. also what’s important emphasize
 don’t long-run numerical inflation goal—the Federal Reserve
 successful individual. don’t see problem recent
 years. tell that, maybe here, feel lucky
 Chairmen had. could come quite differently. explicit numerical
 definition price stability, long-run goal inflation, means nominal anchor less
 dependent upon Chairman is, think that’s actually something good. It’s
 true past problem that, Volcker, Greenspan,
 Chairman Bernanke.
 MR. POOLE. though.
 MR. MISHKIN. problem that, exactly point.
 fact, might get right person future—and could happened
 time around, lucky regard—but even right person,
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 136 203
 
 transition new Chairman complicated. particular, people might remember
 this, Greenspan came in, inflation scare bond markets. Long bond
 rates went 200 basis points, bond market tanked. think also
 confusion markets current Chairman took office whether hawk
 dove controlling inflation. Luckily, think confusion dissipated, think
 actually made life, Ben, little complicated would chosen be.
 way think would like transition new Chairman boring,
 explicit numerical inflation goal long run would help regard.
 Clearly, also standard advantages explicit long-run numerical
 inflation goal would clarify communication public, markets, politicians.
 increases transparency accountability. discussed much—but think Bill Poole
 hit it—is could clarify make coherent discussions inside FOMC. would
 really like know, somebody advocating certain setting federal funds rate,
 inflation goal is. Jeff Lacker dissented particular meeting. idea
 think clear goal is. confused that,
 would harder time understanding you’re taking position you’re taking.
 seen evidence looking central banks operate explicit goal actually
 improved nature deliberations committees.
 Another thing important explicit numerical goal would allow us
 think way monetary policy, becoming better understood

 appropriate inflation path. particular, long-run goal know you’re
 heading talking path goal exactly right way think policy.
 
 October 24-25, 2006
 
 137 203
 
 Let tell would like head ultimately think Committee
 head short run. There’s slight difference considerations I’m going
 bring up. I’d like see long run exactly Bill Poole Jeff Lacker mentioned,
 FOMC’s agreeing explicit long-run numerical inflation goal terms
 saying defining mean price stability. full agreement
 ultimately head there. discussion monetary policy, inside
 outside, focus appropriate path get long take.
 approach consistent learned terms modern monetary policy analysis.
 way learned think and, way, consistent kind policies
 part pursued Federal Reserve past ten years. key part
 success Federal Reserve’s operations that, practice, actually
 operating way.
 approach, four basic principles regarding way
 think changing path think appropriate terms achieving long-run goal.
 First all, ask far away currently long-run goal—so really
 matters. Second, nature shocks, whether they’re transitory permanent, clearly
 important. Third, important aware big projected output gaps
 care output fluctuations, something turn second. Finally, also want
 concerned financial stability issues because, something occurring
 financial stability front, able deal it. kind approach would allow us
 concern business-cycle fluctuations, think key central bank. would
 also allow us change policy response financial instability concerns. allow us
 deal LTCM type situation, potential small probability

 disastrous things happening. fact, consistent Greenspan called
 risk-management approach. think important understand we’re talking
 going rigid form inflation targeting pursue goal.
 let turn second issue decision tree, express
 explicit nominal definition price stability. want discuss subtleties really concern
 right now, means I’m going shift slightly want get long run
 think head intermediate term. Four critical considerations worry me.
 first political process. important get far ahead
 Congress this. extremely important express definition mean

 central issue testimony gave. It’s clear process part American
 system differs many countries. that’s consideration one.
 Consideration two it’s extremely important considered
 Mervyn King artfully called “inflation nutters.” British better training English
 have—they always better phrases things. need make clear that, fact,
 inflation fanatics. key part success Federal Reserve based
 fact Federal Reserve clearly perceived public, politicians, markets

 success that, contrast many central banks, willing express

 Luckily, don’t problem, move toward explicit nominal long-run inflation

 sense, think mandates responsibilities are,
 vehicle achieving that.
 Specifying long-term price stability objective numerically would help coordinate
 expectations reducing public’s uncertainty goal. Long-run expectations would
 become less responsive short-term inflation, therefore probably less persistent.
 enhance monetary policy flexibility many ways. Thus, rather unduly constraining,
 could add flexibility. that’s say numerical definition would influence
 policymaking; indeed, would little point specifying target thought
 wouldn’t. numerical goal would long-run anchor—the nominal anchor monetary

 Now, come firm conclusions precise formulation price stability
 objective. We’ll need consider—as alluded to—which index, period
 define goal, whether choose range point definition. choices,
 me, interrelated. example, long horizon would mean tighter range perhaps even
 point. long horizon makes choice headline core inflation less important.
 proposal pros cons. example, specifying range may preferred

 policy explicit deviation tolerated long.
 said, I’ve really come firm conclusion particular formulation regard.
 Presumably, deciding definition price stability would entail estimating measurement bias
 particular indexes. Robert Gordon recent work estimated bias headline CPI
 0.8 percent per year. likely different estimates bias. Presumably
 ranges help us determine definitions might be. decided agreed upon
 bias, let’s say 0.8, target? Yes, price stability goal. However,
 regard, agree Bill, Jeff, Rick unique number may, fact,
 important number is, long within fairly narrow range.
 think problem little complex also consider view
 models actual optimal inflation. Many models optimal monetary policy
 suggest, depending exact formulation model, optimal rate inflation falls
 range slightly negative slightly positive. Thus, price stability may desirable, may
 optimal circumstances.
 Finally, monetary policy Committee decision. may differ forecasts,
 models, understanding channels monetary policy affects economy,
 seems Committee must agree inflation objective. don’t see,
 discussed, formulate coherent policy disagree numerical long-run goal
 trying achieve. helping communication public’s understanding policy,
 individual definitions would create much much confusion. problem evident today.
 example, seems disconnect market’s view long-run inflation,
 according surveys financial markets seems remain around 2½ percent, statements

 made many us Committee seem comfortable 1 2 percent.
 markets believe seriously committed goal? really committed
 goal 2 percent below? publicly committing specific target, might, hope, obtain
 greater congruence goals market’s expectations. course, remember
 succeed unless actions consistent stated objective.
 Let make two really quick points communications. First, said earlier,
 sometimes I’ve read past FOMC statements I’ve said, “Well, don’t say
 mean?” agree Rick: don’t really like “potential output” either. think it’s important
 strive toward achieving communication strategy trying either confuse
 market send signals basically stating forecasts are, policy
 objectives are, propose get them. Second, I’d like reinforce idea—and Rick
 spent good deal time talking won’t elaborate it—of document like

 last thing I’d like comment relates so-called dual objective Rick’s

 actually making policy way insufficiently sensitive growth.
 Every paper received topic stressed aspects setting so-called
 flexible inflation goal reduce possible cost confusion commitment dual
 goals. Specifically, could set wide range. could choose long period attain
 target. could choose inflation measure less subject volatility, particularly long
 run. could communicate extensively aspects forecast, et cetera, et cetera.
 end, everything goal flexible needs continual communication, it,
 fact, deliver benefits?
 really wonder problem we’re trying solve. communications subcommittee

 Finally, need consider likely interaction Congress set target

 sacrifice, think long-run charts Bluebook show that. There’s research know
 proves lower rate clearly preferable, though inflation stability low level might be.
 sacrifice justified? else might interaction Congress provoke?
 possibility unintended consequences clear.
 Now, think I’m committed accountable, credible, transparent anybody

 Finally, regardless whether numerical specification price stability set

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.

 likely.
 Interestingly, recent survey several referred to, I’m assuming

 Now, I’d like turn second major question, deals governance

 would probably work best anchoring inflation expectations. would also provide

 Finally, question whether policy settings affected long-run inflation

 Would quantification inflation objective new influence? course

 First, look broad evidence, think fair say evidence

 course, whether gains come actions time disclose
 regime, objectives, framework. evidence somewhat stronger
 concerns skeptics critics there’s little basis experience
 countries justify broad concerns exist—that embracing softer responsible variants

 forced suboptimal weights among various objectives; that, example,

 talk makes us different. different, might

 Second, ignorance uncertainty inflation dynamics,

 third question is, would alternative variants regime affect dynamics
